learned men have written on the history or sugar, yet no
one who has read and examined the opinions, disputes, and
arguments of these authors will deny that it is still very de
fective and obscure.   For this reason, and as no article of
commerce, whether we consider the immense quantity of

                           ;

books of Jravels, and works on natural history.        may also              It

be rendered clearer and more intelligible        new revision;      by

    the world known to the antients, ought to be discussed before
    we inquire whether the aritient Greeks and Romans were
    acquainted with sugar; for, if it could be proved that the
    sugar cane was transplanted in modern times from the new
    to the old continent, there would be no occasion for dispute.
    But this point, as might be easily shown, has been neglected
    by most of those who have attempted to write on the nistory
    of plants ; and such an error has been lately committed by
    a man of learning, who entered into a discussion respecting
    the Greek and Latin names of the potatoe [tubcrosum so
    latium), which, without all doubt, was transplanted into
   Europe from South America. In regard to the sugar plant,
   it is indeed certain that it grows spontaneously in many parts
    of Asia and Africa; for it can be established, by incontro
   vertible proofs, that sugar was made in Europe before it was
   known in America *. It is possible that the Greeks and the
   Romans may have been acquainted with a plant abounding
   with sweet and pleasant juice which grew spontaneously in
.  various places ; and as the word sacebarum, which, without
   doubt, signifies some sweet juice, occurs frequently in the
   writings of the antients, it is worth while to inquire whether
   the sacebarum of the antients was the fame as that which we
   use at present.
       What the antients called sacebarum, sakebaron, sakchar,
   or sukebari, was a white substance, similar in consistence to
   salt, and which, like salt, broke under the teeth.                       It had a
   sweet taste, but less so than common honey.                       It was found
   in Arabia Felix, but the best was found in India; and it was
   brought also from the remotest parts of Ariace and the coun
   try of the Borygazi.           It was not made by art, but was pro
  duced by a reed, in the form of gum, or adhering to the
   canes in natural concretions. The largest of these with which
   the antients were acquainted were in size equal to about that
  of a walnut.         In the time of Pliny, Dioscorides, and Galen,
  it was employed only in medicine f.

     This is all that the antients                  have left us in their writings
respecting saccbarum.                 It  is  indeed     short and defective, but
 let us try what certain information can, be drawn from it.
The name itself is of no importance in determining the ques
tion, for antient names have often been applied to new things
with which the antients Were unacquainted. For this reason
then, though the name be the fame, there may be a great
difference between our sugar and that of the antients.                                Nor
can any arguments be adduced from the origin of the word,
since it is altogether unknown, and as there are some who
believe, and not without reason, that this appellation was
given to various vegetable juices found naturally in a con
crete state on the plants which produced them*.
     The plant which produces our sugar, as well as that which
produced the saccbarum of the antients, may, in some mea
sure, be referred to that class of plants called in general reeds
 (arundines), and grows in the fame parts of the East Indies
and Arabia from which the antients procured theirs.                                    But
their saccbarum was not formed from the expressed juice, as
is the cafe with that which we use at present, but was col
lected, in the manner of a gum, upon the reeds themselves.
This circumstance, however, may even be called in question
by those who wish to search only for truth, and to separate
what is certain from what is doubtful.                            For Galen himself

seems to have     entertained some degree of doubt when he
fays,   —"it forms itself into concretions, as we are told,
around the reeds."      This account also may be rendered still
more suspicious when we reflect upon the many ridiculous
things which both the antients and moderns have related re
specting articles brought from distant countries by merchants,
who, for the most part, are interested in concealing the real
nature of their merchandize under false accounts.      Nor do
I fee any arguments to confute those who might assert that
Pliny and Dioscorides were deceived by merchants ; so that
these two naturalists believed the sacebarum, which was an
expressed  juice, condensed by art and the help of sire, to be
a certain kind of gum.      This doubt I, indeed, cannot re
move ; but let us try whether we can produce any thing sa
tisfactory by adopting Pliny's opinion, that the antienty^t--
cbarum was the work of nature, and not of art.          I Ihafl
therefore inquire whether our sugar-cane ever produces sugar
spontaneously; which, indeed, seems not at all improbable,
since we have camphor both in a natural state and produced
by art. This question, indeed, may be determined by the
testimony of those who in India have made this an object of
their attention.
    Hernandez, in a book which he wrote on the plants of
Mexico*, relates that he had heard that fragments of sugar
were found sometimes adhering to the tops of the canes.
Matthiolus t also fays, that he had heard from men worthy
of credit, who haa visited the island of St. Thomas and
Madeira, that in those islands the sugar is found in a con
crete state, like gum, on the sugar canes, by the exuding
of the juice, and not unlike that made by art called sugar
candy.    John Langius          J
                           saw also sugar canes, brought from

Costæus % also believes, from works published in India, that
the sugar is produced spontaneously on the canes at Bethecala
in that country^
     That no doubt may arise on account of the size of the con
cretions, which Pliny fays were sometimes as large as a wal
nut, I (hall here oblerve that this might be easily accounted
for, since the drops adhering to the leaves, being melted by
the heat of the fun, might fall down and be united into one
mass.       Manna concreted in this manner was seen by Nie
 buhr in Arabia §.
     We have therefore a sufficient number of testimonies
which seem to confirm the account given by the antients of
 their facebarum.          I am acquainted, however, with no later
 authors who saw sugar in that form ; and Rumph || denies
 that any of this kind is to be found in India: but that author,
 who examined with great attention the nature of the sugar
 cane, assigns a reason, not at all improbable, why sugar is
 never now formed spontaneously on the canes. The planters,
 he fays, do not suffer the canes to attain to a sufficient age
 for the exudations to be produced, because the cane every

he thinks it probable that the juice might exude from the
canes more easily and more frequently in the warm regions
of Arabia Felix and Indostan than in the islands of India,
which       are more exposed to rains.
     There are, however, still other causes of doubt ; for event
if we allow that the sugar carte sometimes produces concre
tions, yet it is not probable that they possess the fame pro
perties as those which the antients ascribe to theirs.                               For
example,        these   concrete     drops,    on  account     of  their     mellcous
nature, ought, according to everv appearance, to be rather of
a viscid and sticky nature than brittle ; and this doubt appears-
to me of more importance than that proposed by some learned
men who have compared the medical properties of the antient
and modern sugar.              For though some ascribe the same qua
lities to our sugar as those for which the antient physicians
extolled theirs, yet many assert that there is so great a differ
ence, that they believe the two substances to have been to
tally different *. But, in my opinion, there mult necessarily'
be a great difference between fresli sugar formed fpontane-<
ously, and juice expressed by great force, and afterwards in
spissated by the help of fire, and purified by the addition of
various substances.            Many particles are no doubt destroyed
by boiling,         and   many are thrown out with the scum, as the
juice      cannot     otherwise      be formed into a crystalline massy
 since the particles, which are too mucilaginous and oilv, and
 in the separation of which consists the refining of sugar, op--
 pose crystallization too much.                It is indeed not possible in
 any other manner to produce our common white sugar,
 which is forced to crystallize ; but the crystals are exceed
 ingly small, and, by their cohesion, form a continued mass.

 of new sugar found in it all those medical virtues extolled                f

  JO               Dissertation on the History ofSugdn
  sage here    alluded to, because it is evident that Alexander of
  Aphrodisias thought saccharum to be the fame as that fub-
 ltance called at present manna; for he says, Mellis coaguluM
 til quod faccbar Indi appellant quod idem in monte IAbani
fieri certum ell. But Libanon produces fruit-trees, and not
  canes that yield sugar. And we are told by Galen, that such
  abundance of honev was found on the leaves of the trees and
  shrubs of Mount Libanon, that the husbandmen used to sing,
  " Jupiter rains honey *." Alexander of Aphrodisias, there
  fore, alluded to manna, which he called saccharum, or sac-
  char ; but manna, though it has an affinity to sugar, is a
  substance totally different.
     But it is possible that the antients may have been ac-*
 quainted with sugar, to which they jrave some other name;
  and there are even learned men who think that sugar is to be
  understood in various passages of the Greek, and Roman au
  thors, where they speak of honey procured from reeds, of
  Indian salt, and of a sweet liquor obtained from the roots of
  canes.     There can be no doubt that the antients considered
 their saccharum as a kind of honey.                  Whatever was sweet,
  the   antients   called  honev;     and    for   this  reason, latter asjes
  bestowed the fame appellation on every thing endowed with
 peculiar svvcelnoss. In this manner, manna is called a'ero-
 vieli by Athenæus t, or rather Amyntas : besides, from
 manna diluted with water in the fame manner as honey,
 they made a kind of beverage which thev praised as being
 sweeter than honev.          No wonder then if they thought sac
 charum, which was found in spontaneous                     concretions upon
 reeds, and collected in that form, to be, as well as manna,

antients have said of honey found on reeds, I can discover
no certain arguments by which it can be proved that itrwas
the fame with our sugar.
    Among the fragments of Theophrastus, there is one pre
served which treats of honey.     That author, as he generally
does, has distinguished with more care than other authors
all the kinds of sweet substarices known in his time.          He,
however, comprehends them all under the appellation of
honey.      " The first (fays he) is that which is made ort
flowers; the second is that which falls from the atmosphere
upon plants of any kind ; and a third is formed upon reeds."
The first kind which the author here speaks of,           without                   is,
doubt, that honey extracted       bees from flowers the second
                                             by                                 ;
is   amelleous dew, which, no doubts belongs to the manna
of the moderns and the third seems to be the saccharum of
                    ;
Pliny and the Greeks, of which        have hitherto been speak
                                                     I
ing.     But nothing can be drawh from this passage to eluci
date the history ot our sugar *. Megasthenes fays, according
to Strabo, lib. xv. that honey       produced in India on reeds
                                                    is
without the labour of bees.        Thfe words of Isidores con'-
vey as little information
                               " Honey formerly was kind of
                                        :                                            a
dew, and was found on the leaves of reeds and hence Virgil        ;
fays, Haclenus a'irii mellis celeftia dona.    Even yet, indeed;
it   isfound in concrete form, like salt, adhering to branches
                  a
of shrubs in India and Arabia." Seneca expresses himself
almost in the same manner: — "           said that honey
                                                     It   is found                        is
 in India on the leaves of reeds, and that        produced either it   is
 by  the dew of heaven or                    by
                                  the sweet juice os the reeds
 themlelves. Our herbs also have       property of the like kind,

 nature for that purpose %," &c. —These words appear to mi
 to be at any rate worthy of notice, as they confirm what                                      I
 have already aflerted, that the origin of saccharum was little
 known to the Greeks or the Romans, since Galen and Seneca
 fay exprelsly that thev related merely on report         circum                    a
 stance which was therefore uncertain and less probable.

 which       differed neither in colour nor substance from common
 salt,  and     which was said to be endowed with a melleous taste,
 many       men      of learning have been induced to believe that this
 salt is the same as that called sacebarum by Dioscorides,
 Pliny, and others. But, even if we allow this to be true, we
 learn nothing from it that can illustrate Pliny's account of*-
sacebarum ; for the Indian salt is recommended by Paulus
 Ægineta only to those whose tongues are rough and foul, to
 whom I do not know whether any sweetness can be of ser
 vice, whether procured from reeds or from any other plant.
     It now remains that I should consider that sweet liquor
 which the Indians are said to have made from the roots of
 reeds.       This beverage is mentioned by various authors both
•Greek and Latin.               Solinus, indeed, tells us that this reed
 was of a prodigious size ; but Voflius very properly observes,
 that the 'size which he ascribes to the Indian reeds or canes
 could not be that of our sugar cane.                   It is therefore probable
 that Solinus either committed a mistake in ascribing to these
 large canes a juice which in reality was expressed from a
 much smaller kind of reeds, or that the liquor alluded to was
 the produce of a plant quite different from that which pro
 duces sugar.            But some verses of Varro extolled by Isidore *,
                                                                                 and

    Nobody acquainted with Latin will deny, savs Voflius, that there is
 something here in the first line which must offend every car not vitiated.
  Saumaisc increases instead of curing the fault, when he reads Indica nam
 magna.       Voflius thinks that the reading ought to be :

and some expressions also of Strabo *, seem to prove that the
Indian reeds were of an immense size ; though some doubt
may be entertained respecting the opinion or Varro, as the
words are said to vary in different editions of the book. Nor
can there be any doubt but that there are many kinds of
reeds from which a sweet juice may be expressed equal in
sweetness to honev.      But the principal reason why I cannot
affent to the opinion of those who believe that the liquor of
the Indians was made from our sugar cane                         is,
                                                     that no recent
author has praised the melleous juice of the roots, which are
slender and not very succulent.       Nor did Rumph ever hear
in India, that sweet and potable juice was expressed there
                       a
from the roots of either reeds or trees.     The antienl Indians,
had they known our plant, would, without doubt, have ex
pressed from the trunk or stem         potable liquor, as the nar

                                    I
refuted who might assert that the antients were deceived in
this point        by
                 travellers, and falsely imagined that the juice
expressed   from  the stem was contained in the roots.         Nay,
tliis opinion might be confirmed           this circumstance, that
                                                  by
Rumph himself, who certainly examined and was well ac
quainted with every thing relating to the nature of the sugar
cane, its form and size, imagined that the tops of the canes,
which for the most part Incline towards the ground, might
have been considered              by
                              the antients as roots        And this    f.

^4                     Dissertation on the History os Sugar.
     This  essay might appear very defective if I passed over in

silence   the opinion of Saumaise          respecting the sugar of the
 antients, which has been adopted by many learned men.
 This author endeavours to prove, by a variety of arguments,
 that the antient saccharum was the fame as the modern sac-
 (bar mambu of the Indians, and the tabaxir of the Persians
 and the Arabs. I shall not, however, adduce all the proofs
 which he employs, and which have been frequently quoted
 by others, but confine myself to a few observations. As                                   I
 never had an opportunity of seeing, as far as I remember,
 she sugar called mambu, as none of it has been imported
 into Europe in my time, we must consider it to be that men
 tioned by those who have been in India, and who have often
 seen tabaxir.

 not, however, exude that liquor; but those only which grow
 in Bisnaga, Betecala, and part of the province called Mala
 bar; and for this reason many who speak of this tree, or reed,
 fay nothing of its sugar.       This liquor, when found in con                    a
 crete state,         is
                   sometimes    blackish   and sometimes of an ash
 colour, but on that account          not considered to be of worse

 In the time of Qarcias ab Orto               whose words   \,  have hi      F
 therto  vised,  this  tabaxir was as     dear  as  silver.   The name
Jacchar mambu signifies the fame as sugar of mambu, as the
 Indians give the name of mambu to the reeds or branches of
 the tree that produces it.         Piso derives the word tabaxir

                                             unquestionable, and
who were well acquainted with the tree, deny that any sweet

 the antients as have spoken of the Indian reeds, and pressing
juice from them, have never mentioned saccharum on the            :

   In the last place, whatever kind of substance the saccha-
rum of the antients may have been,        was not well known
either to the Greeks or the Romans.       was not in common        It it
use, and employed only in medicine        Nor do we read of
any other sweet substance being used for seasoning food,
making sweetmeats,      and preserving fruit, than honey, in>
which apples of all kinds and even flesh were preserved *.
The antient physicians also mixed honey with their medi
cines in order to render them more palatable.     But even
this circumstance seems sufficient to prove that they were
pot acquainted with our sugar, which without doubt might
have been employed much more conveniently                   both for food
 and in medicine.                Ittrue, indeed, that many things used
                                      is
 for seasoning were employed first in medicine, and were
 then, after      a
                   long interval, introduced into cookery.           Thus,
 spirit of wine and grain were long recommended ,for the use
 of medicine under the name of aqua-vita                 in the like man*  ;
 ner, coffee, tobacco, and many other things that now minister
 to the luxury of our tables, or are in common use, were first
 known as medicines. Even oranges were introduced into
 cookery only at         late period among the Romans, and were
                             a
 not commonly         eaten.      Oranges, said Pliny       are not eaten  f,

 times   are      so
                   necessary    in   food, that the art of cookery would
 be at    aloss could they        not   be procured, occur as seasoning

 J\ FEW         years ago there was seen at Batavia a native of
the island of Bali J, named Kitip, who was so small, and at
 the same time diminished in so symmetric a manner, that he
deserves to be considered as one of the rarest phænomena in
the animal œconomy of nature.
    His whole length amounted only to two feet eleven inches
English measure, or about 33 \ Khinlandish inches; and the
reduction of his body on both sides so regularly alike, that
the opinion of Buffon respecting the power of simple parts
acting on both sides with equal force, from which arise the
double parts on the expansion of the animal body, seems to
be fully confirmed.        The head, though by far too large for
the body of this dwarf, and which might have suited one of
fix feet, exhibited in other respects nothing remarkable.
His countenance, considering his race, was not disagreeable,
 as the features seemed to express a grave and not unpleasant
disposition. His hair was long and black, but here and there
a little erav, because he had already attained to the fortieth
year of his age.       Like most of his countrymen, he had no
beard.      His (kin was of a brownish colour. His shoulders
were broad, and his chest strong.              The belly had the usual
form, only that it was too much contracted towards the
lower part.       His arms were too long in proportion to the
body, and a little twisted or tinned outwards.                  The lower
part of the arms was only half as long as that above the

is called abn Lesser Java.

 18                   Description of a  Dwarf,
elbow    : the hands were short, broad, and of a round form
 before.    The fingers consisted of round stumps, which were
totally loose, without being strongly connected with the bones-
of the hand behind, and which were capable of no movement.
They were furnished with nails, and consisted of the third-
 row only of the finger joints, as the first and second were
 totally wanting.     Each hand had fix of these mapeless fin
gers ; two standing cfose together in the place of the little
 finger, and the other four in the place of the thumb, the
 fore, middle, and ring singer.      The bones of the hand were
bent a little outwards, by which means the fist appeared
 round, and the back of it somewhat hollow.           This small
cavity was of great service to little Kitip on account of the
shortness and immobility of his singers, especially at the time
of his meals, as he used the back of his hand instead of a spoon
in order to convey rice and other food to his mouth.           His
legs were remarkably short ; the feet seemed to have grown
out from them quite solid ; for, though their motion gave
 reason to suppose the existence of the bone of the leg and
ischia, there was, however, no external appearance of them.
The knees were entirely wanting. The feet were short and
broad.      Each foot had fix toes similar in form to the fingers,
and which had grown out in the like manner — but with this
difference, that tbev were connected with the feet by a small
part of their round surface, and that the two which stood in
the place of the little toe adhered somewhat to each other.
    This dwarf was born of well proportioned parents at Sijuo-
ati, in the island of Bali, in the vear 1740.       He never had
the smallest intercourse with the female sex, nor showed the
least inclination for it.   It appeared, however, that he wa»
far from having been neglected by nature in this respect,
and that his continence arose rather from an opinion he en
tertained, that if he denied himself the gratification of inter
course with the lex in this world, he would obtain a more
perfect bodv in the next, but that on this fide the grave
he would remain a deformed dwarf.          However much he was
convinced that Nature had neglected him at his birth, he
nevertheless believed she had given herself the trouble to pre
serve him by a miracle, which took place soon aster he was-
born.      He related, in this respect, that his mother, ashamed
of having brought so deformed a child into the world, re
solved immediately to destroy him, but sound to her asto-
nisliment, when (he attempted to commit this barbarous deed,
that her child was completely invulnerable.      This miraculous
circumstance filled her with astonishment, and conducted hec
back to parental duty.

  II s. Direilions  for Tanning all        Sorts of Hides and Skin,
     according to the new Process introduced by Mr. W. Des
      mond. Commit nic ted by the Author.
                                               N«w Palace Yard, Sept. 2 (¦.
  I AM     flattered to find that you approve of the Directions for
  Tanning; it is certainly tnv wish that this process 'should be
 os generally known and practised as possible.              The extent
 and success with which it is and has b: en carried on during
 the last three or four years by some of the principal tanners
 in Warwickshire, Stasso.dlhire, and other neighbouring
 counties, may be sufficient inducements to all tanners to
 make the experiment, and convince themselves that lea
 ther, equal if not superior in quality to the best hitherto
known, may be manufactured in about as many days as it
generally requires months to tan it well in the usual way, and
with less expense of labour.
     Tanners in beginning the -new process are apt to be startled
at the quantity of bark which it seems to require; but a little
reflection and experience loon satisfy them that, whatever
mode they adopt, the fame quantity of bark is necessary to
tan a pound or anv given weight of leather, and that, the
bark is much less liable to he waited or loft in the new than
in the slovenly old mode : they also find that, by proper ma
nagement, they can give their hides an additional weight,
                                   H2                             equal

20                    DireBions    for Tanning
equal upon an average to ten per cent, upon each more than
in the usual way.
   A hide, to be properly tanned, must have imbibed the
quantity of tanning necessary to saturate it; and whether it
receive that quantity in one or in eighteen months, it can
make no difference in the quality of the leather but a very
material one to the manufacturer.
    The opinion that so many months were necessary to tan
hides, was founded on the clumsy and injudicious mode of
 throwing the hides and bark together in the pits ; but this
opinion is now rapidly giving way, and probably will, with
 your assistance and that of other scientific men, be totally
 exploded in less time than was hitherto required to tan a
 hide.   Tanners will be much indebted to you for your en
 deavours to undeceive them ; and the public, I think, must
 be ultimately    benefited by the general adoption of this
 process.
                        I   am very respectfully,
                              Sir,

      AS that part of the preparation of hides and skins, pro
 perly called tanning, consists in impregnating and saturating
 them with a principle obtained from tan, by which they
 acquire strength and firmness, preserve a sufficient flexibility,
 and become indissoluble and incorruptible in water either hot
 or cold ; so the nature of this process    ist, To ascertain,
                                                   is,             by
 a simple and certain criterion, such substances as contain the
 said principle   2dly, To extract

 in less than tenth part of the tinie usually employed in tan
                 a
 ning; all which operations aie performed in the following
     manner:
        Provide five vessels, called digesters, of any convenient
     materials and dimensions, with an aperture at the bottom of
     each:   let them be placed near each other, and elevated upon
     (Ullages or otherwise,   sothat     pail or other smaller vessel
                                         a
     may be placed under them.       Fill the digesters with tan, that
                             ¦                                      is

ciple ; for this reason, that glue being of the same nature
with the skins or hides of which it is made, whatever sub
 stance unites itself indissolubly with the former, will do so
likewise with the latter.
    This solution is made by dissolving a little common glue
 in water over a moderate sire : by means of                  it,
                                                       not only oak
bark, but also the bark of several other trees, such as the
              chestnut-tree, the American hemlock-tree, pop-
  ar, elm, willow, &c, as well as divers shrubs and plants,
f>lane-trce,
such as myrtle, stuimach, &c. all which         call tan, are found
                                                     I
to contain the tanning principle        and  ;       by
                                                employing the                   so
lution as above,     will, in all cafes, be easy to ascertain whe
                    it
ther any given substance contains this principle or not.
    In the course of these lixiviations two things will be ob
served.    I. The liquor running from the first digester, at
length loses its colour.    If in this state you take little of     a              it
in glass, and repeat the former experiment, the liquor no
    a
longer becomes turbid, but remains clear; which fliows                             it
contains no more of the tanning principle          but    :you pour if
into the fame glass      a few drops of solution of sulphate of
                                                 a
iron, the liquor becomes thick and black. This liquor           not       is
to be poured on the tan           in
                               the second digester, but    to be         is
laid by, and used for the depilation, or taking off the hair or
wool, as will be more particularly described hereafter.                       It   is
distinguislied    the name of gallic lixivium, because
                   by                                        ap           it
pears to contain the fame principles as galls.
   The liquid sulphate of iron obtained is            by
                                               dissolving  small         a
quantity of iron in oil of vitriol diluted with water, or    dis          by
solving green copper as    water. This solution serves to ascer-
                             in
                                  B    3                                       tain

22                         Directions for Tanning
tain such subsiances as contain the gallic principle.              Lime
water will also produce this effect.
     When the liquor ceases to grow black by the mixture of
the sulphate of iron, it will be useless to pour any more water
on the tan in the first digester.            This tan, being exhausted
both of the tanning and gallic principles, must be removed,
and new tan put in its place.
     2. You will observe that the liquor, after running through
all the digesters, at last grows weak.             Add to your stock of
tanning      lixivium     all  the liquor  that  marks  from six to eight
degrees     on   the  hydrometer.      What   proceeds afterwards from
 the last digester is to be poured on the new tan in the first.
Then the fresh water is to be conveyed on the tan in the
 second digester, and the liquor of the first to be laid by, while
it marks fix or eight degrees on the hydrometer, and added
 to the tanning lixivium, which must always be carefully se
 parated from the gallic.            In this manner, the tan in all the
digesters may        be  renewed,   and  the lixiviations continued.
     The number of these lixiviations, as well as the mode of
making them, may be varied at pleasure; the essential point
 is to repeat them so as to give the liquor a sufficient degree
 of concentration, which may be determined by the hydro
 meter, and proportioned to the quickness required in the
 operation, and the thickness of the hides and skins to be
 tanned; all which experience will soon teach.              As all kinds
 of tan are not equally good, it will sometimes happen that
 fix or more filiations will be necessary to obtain a lixivium
 of six or eight degrees : in this cafe, as well as where a greater
 quantity ot liquor is required, the number of digesters is to
 be increased, and the same method pursued as above; and
 when a weaker lixivium is wanted, three or four filiations
 will be sufficient.
     The person who directs these lixiviations should be pro
  vided with the solution of glue and sulphate of iron, already
  described, in order to ascertain the qualities of the different
  lixivia, as well as with a hydrometer or areometer, properly
  graduated, to determine their degree of concentration or spe
  cific gravity.

      1.  IVciJIAng and Flejbing. — Thev should be washed in
  running water, well cleaned, and fleshed in the usual way.
      2. Depilation, or taking off the Hair. — Immerse the hides
  for two or three days in a vat silled with the gallic lixivium,
  and a mixture of sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol, marking
   66 degrees on the hydrometer for acids, and in the propor
                6                                                     tion

  4. Wash         hides repeatedly, and use the round knife ;
                  the
then they are fully prepared for tanning.
   5. Tanning. — The remaining part of the process consists
in tanning, properly so called : for which purpose, steep the
hides for Tome hours in a weak lixivium of Only one or two
degrees ; to obtain which you may take that which runs
from the second digester, or some that has been already used
for tanning.   They are then to be put in a stronger lixivium,
where in a few days they will be brought to the fame degree
©f saturation with the liquor in which they are immersed.
The strength of the liquor being then considerably dimi
nished, it must be renewed ; and when the hides are com
pletely saturated, that             is,
                            fully tanned, whieh     known by         is
cutting off   bit of the edge, remove the leather, and let
              a                                                                 it
dry slowly    in   a   shady place.
                        Calf   Skins,          Goat Skins, &c.
  1. Flesh them with the knife,                         and work them in running
water, like the others.
   2. Steep them in lime water, in which there should be
more lime than the water can dissolve at once.        What not             is
dissolved will subside to the bottom, but mull be mixed with
the water,    bystirring   several times
                               it           clav.         a
   3. After two or three days, remove the skins: when the
hairis  found quite loose, scrape     off on the horse
                                                   it   wash and     ;
press the skins well, until the water running from them                         is
perfectly clear, and the lime totally extracted.
   4. Steep them first in     weak lixivium, then tan them as
                                    a
above; but observe that the tanning lixivium must not be
near so strong as for the hides.
   Lime  is  uled for these soft skins instead of the mixture of
gallic lixivium and vitriolic acid, for this reason, that the
acid always swells the leather more or less, and because the
lime may be more easily extracted from them,             washing      by
                                          13   4                             and

24                    Directions  for Tanning
and compressing     them, than from the          thick   hides, which
when limed are harsh an 1 apt to crack,        if  the lime is not to
tally extracted before they are tanned.
    Amongst the different modes of immersion, which mav be
practised in the course of these operations, the best way seems
 to be that of suspending the hides and skins vertically in the
 lixivia, by means of transversal rods or bars, and at such a
 distance asunder as not to touch each other in anyone point.
 If  they are laid out one over the other, according to the com
 mon practice, they will require frequent handling, in order
 that all the parts may be equally saturated, and to prevent
 the folds or plaits that would otherwise be formed in them ;
 all this would occasion a considerable loss of time and labour.
     In some cases it will be found expedient to mix fresh tan
 from time to time with the lixivium ; this and other modi
 fications, such as the various strengths of the lixivium, the
 raising or not railing the hides, the use of the gallic lixivium,
 &c, which may be found necessary, will depend on the state
 and quality of the hides and skins lo be tanned, as well as on
 the purposes for which they are intended : all these consider
 ations must be left to the judgment of the manufacturer, hut
 do not in any way alter or change the principle on which
 this mode of tanning is founded.
    Besides the very great savings in point of time and labour,
the leather tanned according to the above method, being
more completely saturated, will be fo-ind to weigh heavier,
to wear better, and to be less susceptible of moisture, than the
leather tanned in the usual way.
    THE    following additional explanations may be of use to
those to whom scientific      terms and chemical operations are
not familiar.
     T. Respecting the number, the disposition, and the di
mensions of the digesters.       Five or six of these vessels are suf
ficient to (how, by way of experiment, the nature of the
process, the different principles contained in the bark, how
they are to be distinguished and separated from each other,
&c. But when the business is conducted on a permanent
and extensive scale, a much greater number will be necessary,
not only for the purpose of supplying the required quantity
of liquor, but also for spending or completely exhausting the
tan, particularly in cold weather, or if hard water is used,
and the bark not ground fine enough.            I would recommend
twelve digesters at least, fully to answer these purposes.
    They may be disposed in four rows of three vessels each : the
two middle rows placed close to each other; the two side rows
                                                              separated

same manner and for the same purpose.
  By this disposition of the digesters all the labour of pump
ing is avoided, except from each of the lowest to the upper
most one of the next row.     The four inferior digesters must
consequently be provided with an eye each, for the pump to
stand   in when   necessary.
   Besides the cock or plug placed in the part of the superior
digesters which projects into those immediately under them,
there must be another in the fide for the purpose of conveying
the liquor into the vats, when necessarv, by means of a shoot.
   As to the dimensions of these vessels, their depth mould
not exceed two feet and a half, or three feet at most ; but
they may be as wide as the breadth of the slied or building,
where they are erected, will admit ; and, if lare;e enough to
contain half a ton of bark at a time, the better will they
answer the desired end.      They should be made of wood, and
not pitched.     Metallic or brick digesters would greatly injure
the liquor; no cement, or mortar made of lime, should be
used in them, because lime destroys al! the tanning principle
with which it comes in contact.
   Though these observations are applicable chiefly where
new digesters of the most convenient form are to be erected,
yet even in old tan yards, where some of the pits already in
use may be converted into digesters, their number and depth
should be attended to. There should be twelve of them, at
least, if possible, for the reasons already assigned ; that is,for
supplying the necessary quantity of liquor, and completely
exhausting the tan    : their depth should not exceed three feet,
that the pressure of too high  a    column of bark may not pre
vent the water from dissolving all its parts equally, and that
the tan,   byclodding, which
                               it
                               is      apt to do, may not prevent
the liquor from running.        No more water Humid be poured
on the tan than        is                  it,
                         sufficient to cover     and therefore the
eyes of these spt.nders should be no larger than    is  absolutely
 necessary for the pump to stand in.
                                                                  It

j6                 DireBhns for Tanning,        &c.
    It is scarcely necessary to acid, that the bark as well as the
infusions should be carefully protected from rain, snow, and
hail, which would injure them materially; anil even from
frost, if possible, because the operation of the liquor when
frozen is totally suspended.
    2. Five or fix days are generally sufficient for the immersion
of the hides in the fame vats, as by that time they come to
an equilibrium, in point of saturation, with the liquor; that
is to say,'  they acquire all the strength the liquor can give
them.       They are then to be shifted into a stronger infusion,
where thev may remain the same number of days.                 In mild
weather, if the liquor is of a proper strength,         three   or four
immersions, of five or six days each,       will  be sufficient to tan
the hides, which in the old mode require eighteen or twenty
months lo be completely tanned. To keep them longer in
the fame liquor would be so much lime lost, as in making
the infusions it would be a loss of time to let the liquor stand
more than a couple of hours on the (ame tan. It is not the
length of time during which the fame water stands on the
bark, but the number of waterings, that will completely se
parate the tanning principle from it.            As the heaviest and
best part of the liquor always falls     to the  bottom of the vats,
it' mould be stirred up from time to      time.
    a. The use of the solution of glue should not be neglected.
Since this solution has been made known as a test for ascer
taining the presence of the tanning principle in the infusions
of dirlerent kinds of bark, a great variety of them have been
already found, and many others may yet be discovered, to be
excellent substitutes for oak bark ; and in proportion as their
use becomes general it will necessarily lower the present high
 price of the latter article, and save many young oaks.
    Amongst the barks already found, by means of this test,
 to contain the tanning principle in a greater or less propor
 tion, the principal are those of the following trees, viz.
 willow, asli, hazel, Spanish chestnut, poplar, fallow, cherry-
 tree, birch, sycamore, plum-tree, beech, and elder.
                                           not a sufficient body of
    4. In tan yards where there is
 running water for soaking and washing the skins, in order to
 extract the lime from them, the present mode of extracting
 it in grainers, by means of pigeon's dung, hen's dung, or
 other alkaline substances, may be continued ; but the skins
  ihonld never be put into the fame liquor in which hides un-
 baired with the gallic and vitriolic acids have been tanned.
 The use of these "acids is not absolutely necessary either to
 shorten the time or produce good leather, but when used will
  be found to add considerably    to its weight.
                                                                 5-  By

mersion you will see the bodies separate themselves a little
from each other, owing, as may be readily conceived, to the
effects of the motion occasioned by immersing them in the
fluid.       If
             you then bring one of these bodies near to another,
the latter will every where follow the other, whether you im
merse it deeper, raise it above the water, or move it horizon
tally ; and both bodies will hang to each other, and thus ex
ercise a kind of attractive force. . This, however, is not the
effect of the reciprocal attraction of the bodies ; for, in the
first cafe, that           is,
                      when you immerse the one body deeper,
the other will endeavour to approach          because  it,

the current and the cause of this
                  ;                              is,
                                         that the cohesive power
of the water       notis   strong as the attraction which
                                 so                            ex            it
ercises over that body, and therefore its surface always yields
more, and, keeping behind the body, pushes         forwards, and,
                                                             it
as  it were, swallows       up. This phænomenon
                                 it                     exhibited is
by   all floating bodies which attract the water; for they fol
low the fame movement, which, according to the adhesion
which         has with the body, either rises upwards or sinks
             it
down.
    As    has been observed that all bodies which contain
         it                                                                        a
certain volatile or fixed oil, or resin, have an extensive power,
whether they be fluid or hard, and, in the last cafe, that they
fall into dust as soon as they are applied to the surface of the
water,   I  am of opinion that all substances which exhibit
such    phænomenon contain
         a                          common oil, or resin, which
                                         a
gives rife to it.    will not here mention that series of bodies,

one knows, is an expressed juice, extends itself upon water,
as well as the milky juice of the tilhyinalus and other plants
of the like kind, though visibly with less force ; and therefore
there is no reason to doubt that the farina of fruits and other
feeds is of the fame nature as an expressed juice, as, both in a
hard and fluid state, it extends itself on the water in the same
manner as the milky juice of plants. The cause of the greater
velocity with which farina spreads itself on water than milk and
the milky juice of plants, ought, in my opinion, to be ascribed,
¦without all doubt, to the resinous parts which form a differ
ence between it and milk, as the latter contains a fixed oil.
This is the cafe not only in regard to common meal, but also
in regard to the tuberous roots, all the grasses, and, in ge
neral, all plants ; and besides these, the farina os a great num
ber of seeds of various kinds, both inflammable and incom
bustible, with which I made experiments : mealy fruits have
this property in an eminent degree; and on this account we
have reason to assert that all of them have a superabundance
of resinous particles, and that they must afford nourisliing
food. There is reason to believe that the resinous part of
corn or fruit consists in the gelatine, and therefore I ima
gined that starch, as a kind of mucilage, must be deprived
of its property of extending itself in water ; but              it,
                                                         however,
possesses that property, though        inless degree than meal.
                                            a
We cannot therefore refuse to admit             in
                                                resinous substance
                                                 it  a
also. It    must, however, be    asubstance more mucilaginous
than gelatine itself, or resin; and we must ascribe the differ
ence of these two substance* to the proportion of this prin
ciple, and perhaps also to its different combinations.
    Real gum, when divided into as small particles as possible,
has an extensive movement on the surface of the water also.
I  therefore consider gum, resinous gum, and resin, to be              al
most degrees of one and the fame substance.
  When   I   was making experiments of this kind with differ
ent substances,  thought struck me to pound
                  a                           piece of bread,
                                                         a
made of dry grain, and to make experiments with       also, in    it
order to ascertain whether       itstill retained the property of
meal, and     I found that  it still exhibited the same phæno-
menon.     This induced me to conclude that the resinous part
of meal  is destroyed neither     byfermentation nor the process
of baking.
   BeforeI   quit this subject    may not be superfluous to
                                 it                                    in
form those who may wish to make experiments of this sort,
particularly with view to discover those substances which ton-
                      a
tain oil or resin, what cautions must be used to prevent them
from falling into errors. Their first care, then, ought to be,
                                                              that

under the armpits, over the forehead, or on any other part
of the body from which more oily evaporation proceeds than
from others, and if a piece of earth be taken in this hand and
placed on the water, an extensive movement immediately
takes place.      The fame thing may happen, if the substance
with which the experiment is made be held a long time in
the hand.       It is therefore necessary to wash the hands, and,
after they have been well dried, to proceed to the experiment
by throwing the substance on the water from a small spoon.
 It may thence be readily conceived what errors may arise if
all these precautionary rules are not observed.
 V. Historical     Sketch  of  the Institution and Progress of the
                        Royal Society of London.
 B,BELIEF in        the influence of the stars on the fortune and
 character of man, together with the attention always un
 avoidably given to the measurement of time, preserved some
  knowledge of astronomy among our ancestors even in the
 darkest ages of modern Europe, and rendered it one of the first
  objects of zealous study at the æra of the general revival of
  learning and science. The alchemical dream of the converti
  bility ot all baser metals into gold, engaged many an enthusiast
  and many an impostor in experiments in chemistry, from the
  earliest period in modern history from which we have any
  information of the pursuits of the inquisitive and the learned.
  The uses of common life, and the restoration of this part of
   the science of the antients, encouraged and advanced the
   study of mechanics even in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen
  turies. No other branch of phvsical science but these three
                                                               had

  30             Historical Sketch  of the Institution
  had been much or successfully studied by the moderns before
  the days of Bacon.
      It was the grand merit of Bacon, that he turned mankind
 from investigating in science " merely the relations of exist
 ence (in general very imperfectly known), and of words," —
  " to acquaint themselves more fully, by the experiments of
 the fenses and of auxiliary instruments, with existence in its
 different sensible modifications, and with the mutual relations
 of the various parts of material existence to one another."
 Science was thus at once reduced to " experience, and the
 arrangement of the facts which experience ascertained." The
 united inquiries, observations,     and memoranda, of a3 many
 as possible of the intelligent and enlightened part of the
 human race, were henceforth understood to afford the only
 means for its true improvement.            Men became now first
 sensible, that, by due investigation of the qualities and the
 phænomena of matter, they might discover modes of science
 unknown to the antients.        And the necessity for the associa
 tion of philosophers, in order to the accomplishment of the
         purposes of philosophical inquiry, was from this time,
   y those who adopted the views of Bacon, warmly acknow
 treat
 ledged.
     It dwelt much upon the minds of the ingenious and inqui
 sitive in England.     Milton's plan for a new seminary and
 course of education, in his letter to Hartlib, seems to have
 been suggested by this fundamental idea.         Cowley's proposal
 of a philosophical college, to be established, with an income
 of four thousand pounds a year, at Chelsea, was a sine model
 for the union of a school with a society for the advancement
of physical knowledge. It was within a few years after the
death of Charles the First, that a few of those persons, who
were afterwards incorporated in the Royal Society of London,
began at Dr. Wilkins's lodgings, in Wadham college, Ox
ford, those philosophical meetings which were to be in that
society continued.
     These were almost the first philosophical meetings in Europe .
for the advancement of physical knowledge.             There were in
Italy more than forty academies, for the refining ofthe Italian
language and the social study ofthe sine arts. But, though the
focietiesof architects, sculptors, and painters, might make some
inquiries and observations relative to those parts of physics in
which their respective arts were immediately concerned ; yet
the opprobrium of atheism, which was charged against the
earlier natural philosophers in that country, had, with other
causes, hitherto prevented societies, with express and exclusive
views to physical discovery, from there arising.          In France,
                                                                  an

nistry of Colbert, and the most splendid part of the reign of
Lewis the Fourteenth. The professors in the German uni
versities occasionally met and conversed about the subjects
and ends of their studies; but in these, physical science had,
hitherto, but small share; and there was not as yet, in Ger
many, any separate company of philosophers associated for
the investigation of the laws of material nature.
   Dr. Seth Ward, the Hon. Robert Boyle, Dr. Wilkins,
Sir William Petty, Mr. Matthew Wren,' Dr. Wallis, Dr.
Goddard, Dr. Wi'His, Dr. Bathurst, Dr. Christopher Wren,
and Mr. Rooke, were the principal persons who associated
at the meetings in Wadham college.           They met rather to
perform experiments than to discourse about them. Mecha
nics and chemistry were the branches of science to which
their first experiments chiefly related.   In the year 1658 the
scene of their meetings was transferred from Oxford to Gre-
lham college, in London.        Their numbers were here soon
considerably augmented.        Their meetings were, for a time,
interrupted by the disturbances which ensued between the
usurpation of the Crom wells and the restoration in 1660.
   At the restoration, two Scotsmen, Sir Robert Moray, of
Tibbermuir, and a Mr. Crskine, who, having followed the
king in hi3 exile, had now influence at court, eagerly joined
the philosophical meetings at Gresham college, and per
suaded their sovereign to take the rising society under his own
special patronage.     A  royal charter was soon after granted,
incorporating "these philosophers into a body, to consist of a
president, a council of one and-twenty members, and an in
determinate number of fellows.          William Lord Viscount
Brounker became their first president. The institution was,
for' a time, verv much an object of fashionable attention at
court. The king himself, as the patron and founder, the
duke of Buckingham, prince Rupert, the earl of Clarendon,
the first earl of Shaftesbury, Monk duke of Albemarle, duke
Albert of Brunswick-Lunenburgh, the earl of Peterborough,
                                                            were

   J4               Historical Sketch  of the Institution
  were enrolled at the head of a number of distinguished names
  in the first list of the members — Omnc ignotum pro mirabili.
  For a time, the most extravagant enthusiasm was excited in
  favour of the new society, and from its exertions an improve
  ment the molt extraordinary of all the arts of life was ex
  pected at once to ensue.
      The meetings of the society continued after its incorpora
  tion by charter, as before, to be held at Grestiam college.
 They took place every Wednesday in term time, immediately
 after the lecture of the professor of astronomy in that college,
  and were eagerly attended by the members.                Dr. Croone,
 with the title of register, had, at first, the care of recording
 the transactions at these meetings in journals.           It was after
 wards committed to Dr. Wilkins and Mr. Oldenburgh, the
 two first secretaries.      Cowley had demanded a revenue of
 four thousand pounds a year for his projected college at Chel
 sea ; but the Royal Society was supported without any public
 fund, simply by the voluntary contributions of the gentlemen
 of whom it w;is composed.
     The society entered upon its researches with views at once
 magnificent and philosophically modest.              It proposed but
 " to make faithful records of all the works of nature and
 art." By these it hoped to explode errors, to restore neg
 lected truths, to apply philosophy to the uses of life, and
 to open up the avenues to future discovery.             It professed to
admit into its association men of all religions, all countries,
all conditions and employments in life.             They proposed to
derive useful truth not onlv from the learned and professed
 philosophers, but from the shops of mechanics, the voyages
of merchants, the ploughs of husbandmen, the sports, fifli-
ponds, parks, and gardens, of gentlemen                Some hesitated
whether Mr. Grant, a small shopkeeper in London, the
author of some excellent observations on the bills of mor
tality, should be received into such a company of philoso
phers. But king Charles, on perusing his observations, not
only recommended his immediate admission, but desired that
they would add to their number as many shopkeepers as pos
sible of equal endowments.
     In their researches they would not trust the reports of
others in any cafe where they could bring the matter under
the examination of their own fenses.               In some instances
they    allowed   particular  members   to  choose   whatever subjects
they    should  think   proper ; to institute, at pleasure, any train
of experiments on them ; to defray the expense from the purse
of the society ; and then to report at the meetings the series
and the results of the experiments they had thus made.
                                                                  Other

          and Progress   of the Royal Society of London.       33
 Other experiments    were expressly ordered by the voice of the
 whole society, and were intrusted in the performance, not to
single persons, but to committees nominated for the occasion.
 For inquiry concerning things at a distance, they had, very
 early, begun a correspondence with the inquisitive and enlight
ened in almost every different part of the world. At many expe
riments in the parks, in the royal gardens, and on the Thames,
the king himself zealously assisted in person.     Mr. Huygens,
the famous philosopher in Flanders, received, soon after the
institution of this society, its frequent assistance, and com
municated to it all his discoveries and inventions ; in parti
cular, that noble one of the first application of the motion of
pendulums to clocks and watches. The philosophers of Flo
rence, and especially the grand duke's brother, prince Leo
pold, entered into friendly correspondence with the English
philosophers, and acquainted them with every new observa
tion that was made on nature in Italy. The Germans no
sooner heard of this institution than they sent many of their
books to be submitted to its censure, and contributed like
wise presents of various new instruments of their invention.
The travellers, physicians, surgeons, anatomists, &c. of
France were peculiarly early ana frank in their communi
cations to it. The Academy of Arts and Sciences at Paris
was soon after embodied in imitation of this society : and the
example of the Englisti was quickly, more or less, followed in
almost every country of Europe in favour of the physical sci
ences and the useful arts.
   The experiments which king Charles the second was the
most attentive to, related chiefly to chemistry and mechanics.
He would often amuse himself at Whitehall in the execution
of curious mechanical works. He had also in his palace a
small laboratory for chemical operations. He made astrono
mical observations,    upon various occasions, in Saint James's
Park.     He was exceedingly curious in directing the inquiries
of the society to every thing that concerned the improvement
of the art of fliip-building. He attended and directed dif
ferent experiments at the Tower of London, as well as at
Whitehall, to ascertain the forces of projectiles, with their
variations in different circumstances.
   In their early meetings, the members of the society were
at great pains to distinguish what objects were the worthiest
of their first inquiries. Some were directed to examine all
" treatises and descriptions" of the natural and artificial pro
ductions of foreign countries : others were commissioned to
discourse with seamen, travellers, tradesmen, and merchants,
bv whom those countries and their productions had been per-

34                  Historical Sketch      of the Institution
 sonally examined.         From the       union of the viva       voce witk
 the written intelligence papers were formed, explaining sum
 marily what was known concerning every different country,
 and what remained to be yet inquired into.                    These papers
 were read at subsequent meetings; and queries were then
 drawn from them, to be transmitted for answers to the so
 ciety's foreign correspondents.
      One set ot queries which were prepared among the earlier
 labours of this society, had for its object, to mark " what
  things were needful to be observed in order to the making of
  & natural history in general."            They formed similar queries
  respecting    the  histories   of  the air, atmosphere, and weather;
  of the production, growth, &c. of veeetables ; of agriculture,
  &c. They marked out trains of experiments to be tried on
  rarefaction and condensation; on the petrifaction of wood ;
  on the loadstone ; on the discoveries wanted to complete the
  science of anatomy ; on injections into the blood of animals,
   and on the transfusion of the blood of one animal into an
  other : on the tides of the sea ; on the varieties of oysters, and
  the manner of their nourishment ; and on the phænomena
   of mines. They gave directions to seamen for the observation
   of the eclipses of the moon, the eclipses of the fun by Mer
   cury, and the satellites of Jupiter. They sent abroad direc
   tions for observations and experiments to be made in India,
   China, (the ifland of St. Helena, Teneriffe, Guinea, Bar-
   bary, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, France, Italy,
   Germany,       Hungary, Transylvania, Poland, Sweden, Ice
   land, and Greenland.
       One of the first answers they received1 to their inquiries
   concerning foreign countries, was sent from Batavia by Sir
   Philiberto Verhatti.          It corrected an error, prevalent in Eu
   rope,   "  that  diamonds       and other precious stones were in the
   Indian ifles continually renewed, as by vegetation, in the
   quarries out of which they were taken."                It informed them
   of the existence of a volcanic mountain in Java, and another
   in Sumatra.        It exploded a vulgar error, which one stiould
   have thought to be, even otherwise, incapable of obtaining
    for a moment the assent of philosophers — " that there was in
    the island of Sambrero, lying north from Sumatra, a sensitive
    plant that would, when pulled with the hand, shrink into
    the earth, and that had for its root a living worm."                    It
    brought   one  of  the'first   accounts   propagated    in Europe  of the
    existence of the boban upas, the famous po*fon-trec of Java-
    It added a variety of other curious information concerning

as philosophical truth, onlyin being expressed in the chemical
dialect of that time, which is now obsolete; and in being,
in the intention of its author, to a certain degree accommo
dated to other theories which then prevailed.      In verifying
the theory of Hooke, the society made a number of experi
ments: to ascertain how long a candle, a lamp, or ignited
coals, would continue to burn in a cubic foot of common, of
rarefied, and of condensed air; to exhibit the sudden extinc
tion of flame by the affusion of air already satiated with burn
ing, and the impossibility of even the most intense and torrid
heat to continue without a supply of fresh air; and to find
what particular degree of heat was to be produced from the
burning of every different combustible material. By other
experiments, having a respect to the same theory, they ascer
tained that flame was subject to be extinguistied by the air
in a deep well. They made beside these, and with a view
to discern the varied phænomena of ignition and combustion,
independently of Mr. Hooke's system, a great number of other
experiments on the bringing of copper into a state of great
combustibility, on the igniting of tin filings by the help of
nitre, &c. &c.
   They instituted a multitude of experiments to determine
the nature, properties, and uses of air.    By the care espe
cially of Mr. Boyle, many trials were made to find, by means
of the baroscope, the different degrees of the pressure or gra
vity of the atmosphere at different heights and depths. They
took much pains to discover the opposite limits of the rare
faction and the- condensation of air. They made a variety
pf experiments on the propagation of sound in air : and what
is, ina  chemical point of view, highly remarkable, number a
of their   experiments   were directed to ascertain   "   the genera-

tion of air, by corrosive menstrua, out of fermenting fiquors J
and to determine the fitness or unfitness of such air to support
combustion and respiration."        Other experiments were made
by them for the purpose of discovering how long a man might
live by inspiring and respiring the same air; whether air
contaminated by respiration might be again made pure and
relpirable ; whether the unfitness of contaminated air for
respiration were not a quality altogether independent of its
temperature, as hot or cold. By other experiments they exa
mined what quantity of air might be sufficient for the respi
ration of an animal for a given space of time ; and in what
manner air, previously applied to support combustion-, became
by that unfit to be respired.      Others of these experiments re
spected the necessity of air to support vegetation ; and it was
 the object of others to examine what use was made of air in
 the vital functions of fishes under water.
     Water was the immediate subject of many of their first
 experiments.      Some of these were made to ascertain the dif
 ferences in the specific gravities of different sorts of water.
 The Torricellian experiment on the ascent of water in vacua
 was repeated in almost every possible change of circum
 stances.     Other experiments were made on the production
 and phænomena of steam.            By others they endeavoured to
 find the differences in the heat of the waters of the ocean at
 different depths under the surface.
      On stones and metals they instituted many experiments.
 Lead, diamonds, the Bologna stone, the separation of silver
 from lead, and especially the loadstone and the magnetized
 needle, were now first philosophically examined in regard to
  some of their most important qualities.
      They examined the growth of vegetables in different sorts
  of water ; the utility of steeping feeds ; the inversion of the
  roots of plants set for growth ; the decrease of the weight of
  plants growing in air; the reunion of the bark to the wood
  from which it had been stripped.
      Their medical and anatomical experiments were numerous.
  They dissected a camcleon : they made injections into the
  veins of different animals: they made a number of obferva*
  tions and experiments with a view to determine how far
  there might be truth or falsity in the doctrine of the equi
  vocal generation of insects : they made many trials on the
   meaner animals of poisons and antidotes : they tried what
   effects might ensue from the transfusion of the blood of one
   animal into the veins of another : and they made likewise
   some curious experiments on the hatching of silk-worms in
   rarefied, air.
                                                             Their

    Their experiments on the freezing of water in different
¦circumstances; on the production of cold by saline solutions;
on ice,  to evince that it was susceptible of various degrees of
 cold more intense than that of simple freezing; andon the
congelation of oils ; were various, interesting, and prosecuted
with the most attentive accuracy. A curious train of expe
riments was made at the Tower, under the immediate inspec
tion of the lord viscount Brounker, to ascertain what changes
might be produced on the weights of lead and copper by sub
jection to fire in a cupel. Both the copper and the lead
were found to gain (by oxidation, no doubt,) an addition.
 The cupel suffered always a diminution of its weight when
 ignited, but not a diminution equal to the augmentation in
 the weight of the metals.
    Among the instruments invented by the society within a
few years after its institution were, an universal standard
measure of magnitudes by means of the pendulum ; a wheel
 barometer, and other instruments, for finding the pressure of
the air; an auger for boring the ground, and fetching up
parts of the strata through which it should pass in their na
 tural order; an instrument for measuring the swiftness and
 strength of the wind; a diving-bell,     and a pair of spectacles
with which a diver might see any thing distinctly under
water; several engines for finding and determining the force
of gunpowder; several acoustic instruments to assist and im
 prove the fense of hearing; a. chariot way -wiser, which would
exactly measure the length of the way of any coach or chariot
 to which it was applied ; an instrument for grinding optical
glasses ; a variety of telescopes, &c. &c.
    A manufacture of glass had been, more than thirty years
before, established in Broad-street, in London, by a company
of mercantile adventurers, among whom the most consider
able person was admiral Sir Robert Mansel.         Workmen and
superintendents were procured from Venice.         It might have
gone on successfully, it the great civil war had not broken out.
Soon after the restoration, the duke of Buckingham, at a vast
expense, established new glass-works in London ; and the art
was there, within a very few years, carried to such perfec
tion, that these works supplied better glass for microscopes and
telescopes than that which was to be had from Venice.         The
duke of Buckingham not only expended much money upon
 those glass-works, rather as an experimentalist than a manu
facturer, but took a warm and active interest in various other9
•f the society's pursuits; and it was under his immediate pa-

       SIR,
 I    perceive, by some excellent articles which have at dif
ferent times appeared in your Magazine, that you are not
averse to illustrate the sciences and arts by the lights of clas
sical erudition.    I cannot pretend that there is much erudi
tion in having particularly remarked the following passage in
the life of the Roman emperor Pertinax by Julius Capito-
linus. But it certainly evinces at least one ingenious mode
of mechanical art, which I had supposed peculiar to the mo
derns, to have, on the contrary, had a distinct existence like
wise among the antients.
    This passage occurs where the biographer has occasion to
relate, that Pertinax, to find money for a donative to the sol
diers of the prætorian guard, sold off, by a nine days auction,
the sumptuous dresses, furniture, and curiosities of art, with
which Commodus had filled the palace.              It is a part of an
abridged    inventory  of  the   things   fold at that  auction.    It
consists of two clauses : I speak, for the present, chiefly of the
latter.

VII.   Observations on the Spots of the Sun, and the Nature             of
    the Light of that Luminary.     By M. Von Hahn *.
O,'UR      experience of the various effects produced by the
fun's rays, and particularly the doctrine of latent heat and
specific heat, seem to confirm the opinion that light is an
actual body which streams forth from the fun, and which is
connected, in a variety of ways, with the bodies of our
earth.   The determination of the following question, which
belongs peculiarly to chemistry,
                                   " Whether the fun be actu
ally a Durning body, or only attracts the illuminating matter
from the surrounding expanse of the universe?" may receive
some illustration from continued observations made on the
body of that luminary.        ,
   One great difficulty here           is,
                                   that the fun has    peculiara
light, and we are accustomed only to consider objects which
almost continually receive their light from without, and
which commonly produce shadows more or less perceptible
according to the ditTerent directions and strength of the light
which falls upon them. Now our eyes, being accustomed
to shadows and projecting images,              by
                                        beholding an uncom
mon kind of illumination are thrown into embarrassment,
and cannot bring the images in harmony with sensation, the
basis   of all perspicuity.
   One may observe the sun     long time without discovering
                                    a
any other spots than those which are common.        The first
view, therefore, of the so called solar faculæ produces an
        From Profcjsor Bcde'i Astronomical Almanac for the Tear 1796.

4-0           Observations    on the Spots   of the Sun,
agreeable   surprise, as it exhibits something very different
from what we     see   those parts of surrounding nature which
                        in
are nearest to us.   With a HerschePs telescope of seven feet,
one beholds with astonishment, and very distinctly, in those
spots in the middle of the fun's orb, parts beset with little
hills separated by valleys, and single mountains, of a proporr
lional height, which project strong shadows.     It is worthy of
remark, that these objects have as diminished an appearance
as when one looks at things from a great height.       The cause
of this is to be sought for in the situation of the light which
falls on them, and belongs to those optical deceptions that
must occur so frequently in observing the sun, and on a know
ledge of them depends the whole secret of forming a proper
judgment respecting the solar bodies.
   The fineness of the delineation, the scenic appearance,
 and the regularity of these objects, induce one to believe that
solar landscapes are here actually represented ; and totally de
stroy the idea of the sun being a flaming body; for it is im-
poflible that the irregular movement of flame could ever
produce such scenes.    These parts are, at times, of a more
whitish colour; but it ought to be particularly remarked that
they have a somewhat dimmer light than the rest of the sun's
orbit, which is every where luminous.      If the division of the
lights and sliadows, the kind of illumination, and the gra
dation of the shades, be accurately observed and examined,
we shall be obliged to admit that these faculæ in the sun are
landscapes.
   The most   important observation here          is,
                                              that when there
are   group of such landscapes the shadows are almost always
      a
projected to one fide, and are sharp-pointed.    This circum
stance serves to render clear to the eye  confused mixture of
                                              a
spots.
   Let one search out, in the neighbourhood of such groups,
small, single, insulated spots, and observe whether there      is
seen neai    them     weak gradation of sliade, or
                       a                             luminous
                                                           a
vapour which    isvery familiar to us, and which (hows that the
light illuminates an eminence on all fides, but not with equal
strength.    If the eye      once accustomed to the effect that
                             is
hence arises,  it can with great ease convert an often exceed
ingly compound mixture of dark parts and luminous spots
into well arranged images.
   There are certainly cafes in observing the sun when drafts
men and painters only could be able to arrange properly the
mixture of faint spots, and to obviate the deception which
arises from half shadows.     When an eminence, for example,
is    so
       strongly enlightened       by
                                  the luminous matter near     it,
                                                           that

sometimes be the cafe that the light may be higher, nearer,
or at a greater distance in one district than another} and
therefore it is difficult, under all these circumstances, to form
a right judgment of an object in the fun.
   The fun, therefore, must be inclosed in a luminous cover
ing, or surrounded by an atmosphere of light — an idea first
started by Mr. Bode; but the peculiar quality of it remains
to be more fully investigated.    A globular covering of boiling
light seems to be too moveable to produce the above phæno-
mena.     The irregular spreading of the surrounding flame
would every moment change the scene ; as a mixture of lu
minous matter with the iolar atmosphere would give it an
obscure appearance, and be contrary to the smoothness of
that line by which the solar disk is bounded.
   The fun may be considered as an opake body of itself, and
surrounded by an atmosphere almost similar to ours; but the
luminous matter as an uncommonly fine fluid, which, like
liquid naphtha, floats on this atmosphere, and, on account of
its great lightness, can never sink down under any circum
stances whatever,
   The atmosphere of the sun, by his rotation, being raised
higher under the equator, will be depressed towards the polar
regions.    The luminous matter is attracted from the celestial
expanse; and this hypothesis, which has been adopted by
many, appears to be the true one, because the phænomena
on the surface of the sun can be best explained by it. It
must however be premised, that no more luminous matter is
attracted than may be necessary to form almost a total cover
ing to the fun; and that, on account of the continual influjfc
towards the poles, it must often happen that the quantity
there will be diminished. This is a consequence of the thing
itself; for, if it be admitted that the separation of the lumi
nous matter is performed by a chemical affinity, the effect of
which is facilitated by the fun's rotation, the attraction will
wase when the solar atmosphere has imbibed a sufficient
                                                         quantity.

 42             Observations   on the Spots   of the Sun,
 quantity.     By observing the sun, we perceive not only the
 luminous matter, but the light reflected, in a lively manner,
 from the fun's body ; and at such a distance they cannot
 be distinguished from each other.          Through a deception of
 our senses, we often take the effect for the cause, and seek
 for the object in the light, and then again for the light in
 the object.
    But as the atmosphere, greatly expanded at the equator,
 must fink down somewhere from well known causes, the lu
 minous matter flies off on all fides towards the lower parts,
 and illuminates the parts it left, no longer from above, but
 laterally. Here we discover the solar faculæ ; and if in those
 parts there be inequalities, there arise then half shadows,
 which are almost lost in the tint of the ground.           If the ob
 server fails in his judgment of the anede of inflection, he fees
 only a mixture of faint spots, and no landscapes.
    It will now be easier to explain the proper spots in the fun,
 as they are called.     They are parts of the fun lying under
full shadows, which must naturally arise when the illumi
nating fluid draws itself so far back from the horizon of that
neighbourhood, that no more ravs can reach its centre. The
 contrast with the rest of the dazzling disk of the sun in
creases their blackness, and gives them the appearance of a
burnt coal, or cinder.       We shall be readily convinced that
some parts of the fun's surface may lie in a full shadow, when
¦we reflect on the great size of these spots,        and consider the
height    of  the  luminous   fluid   to be  small, or equal to about
the distance of our highest clouds from the earth.           It cannot
 be higher, else no perceptible half shadows would be occa
sioned, because the shadows of bodies become smaller in pro
portion to the height of the illuminating point. The irregu
larity of the spots arises partly from the different situations of
the luminous matter, and partly also from the inequality of
the bottom.       That remarkable vapour by which they are
surrounded is occasioned by a kind of crepusculum, by which
the side light is conveyed to the most distant part from the
centre of the stiadow.      As the luminous matter now appears
to  be more    sparingly divided   in the solar atmosphere, a place
may    be  totally deprived    of  light by its retiring: but near
the boundary of the light it is directed towards the bottom,
though somewhat weakened by the refraction and reflection
of the rays, as is the cafe in our morning and evening cre-
pufeula ; and the spots by these means obtain their conical
form.     If we consider this vapour more attentively, the be
fore-mentioned landscapes can be clearly distinguished .ac
cording to the above method ; and if the full shadows have
                                                          considerable

blackness'of the spots, and the matter which surrounds them,
would oppose^such an idea. Such a continual phænomenon
is sounded on invariable causes, and cannot be reconciled
with the changeable nature of clouds. A real solar land
scape may be recognized to be the same before seen, even after
some time, when the direction of the light which falls upon
it has changed.
   It is more than conjecture that the fun separates the lu
minous matter from the firmament, and partly appropriates
it to itself and partly transmits it to other bodies, which, on
account of their less magnitude, are unable to effect the fame.
As so many stars shine with their own light, it is probable
that they all derive it from the fame source; and that the
immense space of the firmament contains this all-enlivenin
matter, which nature has dealt out with a sparing hand, an
seems to have destined for the most important purposes.
   The phænomenon of the zodiacal light may be very natu
rally explained according to these ideas. The separation of
the light takes place more at the fun ; it floats on its atmo
sphere in exceedingly small quantity ; and, as it streams out
immediately in all directions, the terrestrial bodies are se
cured from immoderate heat by this tendency to diverge.
The attraction of the luminous matter from the firmament
must extend to a considerable distance ; for that set free at
the sun is supplied by another quantity, which seeks for an
equilibrium, and therefore forces itself towards the solar equa
tor. It accumulates therefore in those parts; and, as it is
half separated, on account of the attraction of ihe sun acting
at that distance, this mean state produces the paleness of the
zodiacal light.    This conjecture seems to be confirmed by a
remark of Caflini.      At a time when the solar spots were in
visible, no zodiacal light was to be seen. The absence of the
spots (hows a superabundance of the luminous matter on the
fun ; consequently none is separated, and these phænomena
must cease.     Were their seat in the solar atmosphere, they
                                                            must

 show themselves more strongly the more widely the light is
 dispersed over the body of the sun.
     Posterity, perhaps, will be able to deduce the cause of the
 northern lights and other phænomena from these suggestions
 respecting the production of the luminous matter, and lo
 answer the important question — " By what circulation is
 that noble matter, which diffuses light and heat throughout
 all nature, again conveyed back to infinite space; or whether
 destined and employed for the formation and maintenance
 of organic bodies ?"
       VIIL    Experiments on Platina.       By   L. Proust      *.
 I. Of the foreign   Bodies mixed -with native or crude Platina.
  JL HE bodies generally mixed with platina are stony and
 metallic sand, pyrites, gold, and mercury.            The first kind
 of sand consists of small rock crystals and fragments of a hya
 cinth colour ; the second consists of ferruginous sand of two
 sorts : the one octaedral, and susceptible of being attracted
 by the magnet, among which there are some that do not
 possess that property till after being heated : the other fort is
 equally black and angular; but the angles are destroyed in such
 a manner, that it is not possible to determine their figure,
which seems to announce that they are not so hard as the
preceding.      The latter are not susceptible of being attracted
by (he magnet, even after they are heated, and when analysed
 they exhibit new substances combined with iron ; phæno
mena by which we are authorized to consider them in their
union as a mineralization of a peculiar kind; as will be seen
hereafter.
II.   On the Method     of separating    the Sand   from  the native
                          or crude   Platina.
    Place three or four pounds of crude platina on a large
table the edges of which are somewhat raised, and at the
distance of a foot from one of the sides ; then spread it out,
by means of a card or a rule, in such a manner as to occupy
the space of about two feel, and blow upon it obliquely with
a pair of hand bellows, to make the sand, which is always
liehter than the gold or platina, pass to the opposite side.

                              III. Of      the Gold.
    All
      the gold contained in crude platina is seldom disco
vered,even with the help of a magnifying glass; and as
mercury is the means employed to separate them, it is evi
dent that, if a few grains of gold remain, they must retain
their portion of the mercury.        Hence the gold acquires a
white hue, which assimilates it to the colour of the platina,
and prevents it from being perceived.
    I do not know whether the workmen at the platina mines
are acquainted with any certain method of ascertaining whe
ther the separation be complete. A very simple process             to           is,
heat the platina rn an iron spoon or crucible.         The mercury
becomes volatilized, the gold resumes its colour, and the
platina acquires that of calcined iron.         The gold then, on
account of its colour, may be very easily distinguished from
the platina.
    In this manner       separated

 13 from others.     The mean product           10 per cent., as

               IV. Of Sulphur     as the    Miner alixer    of  Platina.
    When crude platina     exposed to the heat of the blow-
                                  is
pipe on charcoal,    strong smell of sulphur
                          a                      exhaled, ac    is
companied  with   fumes which do not whiten gold, and which
are not produced but               by
                               degree of heat superior to that
                                        a
which volatilizes mercury.    Black platina grains give more
fumes than the white.

  46                 Experiments on Platinat
     Large grains of platina picked and heated, emit also an
 odour of sulphur accompanied with fumes. A person em
 ployed bv government to collect platina informed me, that
 the largest grains he ever saw never exceeded the size of a
 pea ; and that he had given several of that size to the arch
 bishop of Santa- Fe.     In regard to the enormous grain said
 to be deposited in the cabinet of Vergara, the director of the
 Biscayan society assured me that he had no knowledge of it.
     When crude platina is brought to a red heat in a covered
 crucible, no odour of sulphur is perceived with the vapour of
 the charcoal, but at the moment when the crucible is unco
 vered this odour manifests itself very powerfully ; but if the
 crucible be shut close it ceases.       It was long before I was
 able to discover the nature of this vapour; but the experi
 ments, which will be described hereafter, proved to me that
 it is nothing else than concentrated sulphuric acid.
     From 1600 grains of white crude platina well purified,
 and heated in a retort, I obtained only half a grain of mer
 cury and a grain and a half of water, without any kind of
 gas.    Having broken the retort before it was quite cold, it
 exhaled a sulphurous odour.        The platina became black,
 and was found slightly cemented, and adhering to the glass.
    A mixture of 400 grains of the fame crude platina and an
 equal quantity of sweet muriate of mercury, healed in a re
 tort, gave, after the sublimation of the mercury, a very light
 stratum of cinnabar, which adhered to the top of the retort,
 and, when scraped a little, assumed a vermilion colour.
    Crude platina, heated in a crucible and immediately poured
into a silver disli, blackens the vessel in the fame manner as
sulphur.     In a word, all solutions of platina form an abun
dant precipitate with barytes.
    As sulphurets of platina, both native and artificial, do not
suffer their sulphur to escape when heated in covered vessels,
there is reason to believe that this metal cannot be entirely
freed from it by an open fire ; for the sulphuret, which occu
pies the centre of each grain, may then be considered as shut
up in a vessel.
    Here, then, we have sulphur as a constituent part of crude
platina.    It may here be asked, with what combustible this
sulphur is united.     If it be recollected that iron, and even
copper, exists also in this ore, it will not be supposed that it
is combined with the platina ; and yet it is with this metal
that the sulphur is united, as will be seen hereafter.     In the
mean time it may be deduced, from ihe preceding experi
ments, that what is at present called, and what ought to be
continued to be called, crude platina, is evidently nothing

oxidated iron ot 48 per cent.        The platina which remains'
has recovered its whiteness.
   I shall here give an account of an experiment made a good-
many years ago by C. Darcet, and at which I was present.
That chemist put into a crucible, placed in the porcelain fur-'
nacc of Serres, some ounces of crude platina: when taken from
the furnace the platina was triturated with water, and sepa
rated by these means from all the powder it contained. After
this first substance was removed from     it,   was put again into
                                                it
the furnace, and purified   a   second time in the same manner   j
and this operation, being repeated, gave           new quantity of
                                                     a
powder. After pasting through the furnace in this manner*
as far asI     can remember, seven or eight times, the platina
was totally changed into an oxide of      a   very dark brown co
lour.  I    was prevented,      by particular circumstances, from
learning of Darcet what was the result of his last experiments.
    An account of experiments made oil platina in the porce
lain furnace of Fursteroburg may be seen in the Journal de
Tbyjique   ;   but as the author did not take care to remove the-
oxide as it    was formed, be concluded, as Macquer, Baume,
and other chemists had done, that platina was indestructible.
But let us return to the oxidation in question.
    The muriatic acid, of which we have spoken, had taken
 from the calcined platina three oxides, viz. that of iron, that
 of copper, and that of platina. This solution, united with the
 solution of muriate of ammonia, gave the yellow precipitate
 which  is  peculiar to platina.
    Potash being employed to complete the precipitation from
 the liquor, the result was  a   second precipitate of red oxide of
 iron, mixed with   a   little copper, which immediately mani
 fested itself by  muriate of ammonia.
  If   in this solution there had been found only       little oxide,
                                                         a

                                                              lution

48                  Experiments on Platina.
lution of platina would have exhibited nothing astonishing.
But as its deoxidation could not be ascribed to such a
cause, it must be inferred, that when platina is combined
with Other metals, it becomes oxidated much easier than has
hitherto been supposed.      Platina, then, has this property,
like all other metals, in which the state of combination al
ways favours oxidation.
   The following is the detail of an experiment made with
great care.   Eight hundred grains of crude white platina,
well purified from gold, sand, and mercury, after having been
calcined for the space of an hour, had lost only one grain.
Having afterwards exposed them to the action of muriatic
acid, they lost in the acid four grains and a half, and resumed
their whiteness ; by which it is seen that the oxygen of the
atmosphere had almost replaced the weight of the sulphur
dissipated.
   The 794! grains, being calcined a second time, became
black, and their weight was increased two grains, but the
smell of sulphur was no longer distinguished; a circumstance
which renders the combination of oxygen more striking.
Having been again exposed to the muriatic acid, they lost
o4- of their weight : they were found to be black, and visibly
corroded.
   The 788 grains which remained were boiled a third time
in the fame acid, and the result was a new loss; but that -
which they experienced in fresh acid, after a fourth ebulli
tion, was flow, and far inferior in the two last mentioned
boilings : it did not exceed four grains and a half.
   The weakened action of the acid made me believe that I
ought to continue the oxidation in order to penetrate further
into the interior of the platina, which induced me to proceed"
to a fourth calcination ; but it was useless, for the grains ex
perienced no change either in their weight or their colour:
the application, therefore, of the muriatic acid was to no pur
pose.    The exterior of the grains had then the appearance of
pure platina, having a very strong resemblance to silver of a
low alloy.
   The total loss sustained by these 8co grains was Tj'^ grains,
or a little more than two hundredths.      A grain of gold, not
perceived in purifying the crude platina, was found towards
 the end of the operations ; and this grain proved to me that
 the muriatic acid alone produced the effects I have described,
 and that nitric acid had no share in them.
    The metallic solutions of which we have spoken contained
 each platina, iron, and copper : they became turbid with the
 muriate of ammonia; from which we may infer, that if the
                                                          platina

 mercury a sufficient quantity of oxygen to effect their solu
 tion.     The   loss  of the ore was        12 per cent.      We  are there
 fore obliged to acknowledge three metals in platina ore. We
 shall show hereafter, that besides sulphur it contains also two
 other combustibles *.
        VI.   Experiments tuilb the Nitric           Acid   on Platina.
    Nitric    acid of 35 degrees, in which crude platina, purified
 from sand, iron, and copper, was boiled, did not even alter
 the polish of the grains : it only separated the mercury from
 the gold.      The same acid had as little action on the platina
 grains blackened by calcination, and subjected to the same
 ebullition : they retained their crust, and the state of the acid
 was in no manner changed.                Margraf and Lewis, however,
 assert that nitric acid has some kind of an action on them.
 But their acid either contained muriatic acid, or the grains
 on which they operated were more ferruginous. This is very
 possible; for there are some kinds of crude platina which have
a greatmany incrusted grains, and others cavernous, which
contain red oxide. The black coloured crude platina in my
 possession, and which belonged to Don Pedro d'Avila, is in
that state.      I can now entertain no doubt that black kinds
of platina are sometimes brought to us. That sent a few
years ago to the king's cabinet, of which I have a specimen
given me by our translator of Busson, is of this kind.                        It
may be whitened by means of the muriatic acid, but not
   * The     author of the Mineralogy of Spain, Don Christian Herrgen,
expresses   himself thus in the seventh number of the AnnaUi de Cienciat
 Maturates:   "  After having read the memoir publislicd by L. Proust in
the first "alume of this collection, one is obliged to acknowledge that platina
is never found pure in a native state; it always exhibits a real tnineral-
izition, as this memoir proves. It is much to be regretted that we have
fiot yet the least geognostic nonce respecting this valuable substance. Don
Herrgen indicates at the fame time the pi ices where platina is found,
which are, Cboco, Popavan, Quito, Rio dtl Pinto in the province of Peru,
 Carthagena. and B.a liuU in NiW Grenada.

sufficiently to acquire the brilliancy of the white kind used

   VII. Of the    Effetls of the Nitro~murialic Acid on Platina.
    I  composed    this acid with the nitric and muriatic acids.
I   (hall mention hereafter the proportions best calculated to
effect this solution.
     Four hundred grains of crude platina well picked, which
 had been transmitted to me by Don Casimir Ortega, being
 treated in this acid until it had lost all its action, there re
 mained a black matter, which, when washed, and collected
 together in a china cup, was found to weigh ioi grains, or
 a pounds 10 ounces per cent.
    The fame quantity (400 grains) of crude white platina,
which I received from Don Domingo Fernandez, left six
grains of a black residuum, or one and a half per cent.
    An equal quantity of the fame kind, of which the largest
   articles were selected, left 14 grains, or 3^ per cent., of a
E lack residuum. These three experiments give a mean pro
duct of about z\ per cent.
                 VIII. Of the   crude Black   Platina.
    Four hundred grains of the platina of Don Pedro d'Avila
 left a residuum or 7 grains, or 1 pound 12 ounces per cent.
     Four hundred grains of the fame left a black residuum of
 o grains, or 2 pounds and a quarter per cent.
    An equal quantity of the largest particles of the fame left
 a residuum ot 3 per cent. Thus the mean product of the black
 kind was 2 pounds 12 ounces per cent.
     It is here seen that there is a very remarkable variation in
 the quantity of these refiduums : it arises, first, from the very
 variable action of the solvent, which more or less destroys
 the substance of the residuum ; and, in the second place,
 from there being sometimes found in these refiduums parti
 cles of that metallic sand of which we have spoken, and
  which are generally pretty laFge, and imbedded, as it were*
  in the heart of the platina.     This fact has been observed also-
  by  Guyton.
                  IX. Of the Graphite of Platina.
     The refiduums of which we have spoken are nothing else
  than graphite or plumbago : it burns slowly by the blow-
 pipe, inflames nitre, and deprives the arsenic acid of its oxy
 gen > it leaves sinning or glossy traces on paper ; when ex-
  nosed to heat, it loses neither its softness to the touch, nor its
                                                           property

               X.    Observations on Solutions of Platina.
    To free these solutions from the nitric acid employed in
excess to oxygenate the muriatic acid, they must be con
centrated till they acquire the consistence of honey. The
superabundant muriatic acid, becoming oxygenated in its
turn at the expense of the remaining nitric acid, acquires
the quality of oxygenated muriatic gas combined with nitrous
£as-                          .               .  ¦
    The saline mass which remains is of a dark brown colour:
it dissolves in warm water if the desiccation has not been too
strong; for in that cafe the part which resists solution is a
brown muriate containing less acid, in which platina, iron
and copper are re-found, and from which the muriatic acid
cannot be separated even by several washings. In regard to
the liquid solution, it is merely a muriate; for, when decom
posed by means of potash, nothing is produced but muriate
of potash and a little sulphate. It has an astringent taste,
but without any of those metallic savours which are so dis
agreeable in all solutions of silver, copper, &c.
    If   the solution in this state be treated with potash, the
saline precipitates common to all solutions of platina will
be obtained, but not an atom of nitrate will be obtained by
evaporation ; from which it may be inferred, that the nitric
acid of solutions not concentrated has no part in precipita
tions of this kind. It will be seen, in the course of this paper,
that the slightest vestige of this acid is not found in the pre-
   * On fusing crude platina with oxygen gas, a black shining scale forms
•n the outside of the globule, which may be separated by the hammer.

tions, however, there are some effects more striking, which
I   shall here point out.
     When the nitro-muriatic acid, aided                       by

face of the liquor.      These globules float in every direction,
and at length adhere to the fides of the retort, or vanish, to
give place to others.       These phænomena being, common to
many sulphurous metals, we are authorized to oelieve that
this arises from the sulphur which envelops these bubbles of
gas.      This powder, when thus deposited on the fides of the
¦retort,      soon dissipated; because, being very minute, and"
               is
in small quantity,            soeedily subjected to the action ot

of the water the mineral found there to rub strongly be     ;             it

unite it to the former.             evident, from what has been
                                    It   is
here said, that the friction and shocks experienced               the                     by

effect the separation of the black powder.
   If these grains, instead of being pounded, are left whole,
and if  they are examined with          magnifying glass,
                                                  a             seen                 it   is
that they have retained their form, that they are easily broken,
and that they are hollow, and covered with brilliant laminae.
The aperture through which the solvent has penetrated into
the interior     isoften discovered; and as their colour           in                      is
nothing different from that of the powder, there can be no
doubt that the latter        the residuum of the erosion of the
                              is
grains  of  the   platina.    In     word, these phænomena are
                                         a
more remarkable        inblack platina ore than in white, because
the principle which produces this powder appears to me to
be more abundant in the former.

being calcined in   wide crucible, exhaled sulphuric acid

phurous character.     The residuum was pretty black,                                          and

the result was an ammoniacal muriate similar to others, of
which I    shall speak hereafter.   The remaining liquor was
found much less coloured than usual.         treated   with potI             it

all iron oxidated to its maximum produces.        We have here,
therefore,   on the one hand sulphur, and on the other phos
phorus, combined in the residuum of our crude platina                                            in,
greater quantity than         in
                           the metal itself.

than 42 grains,        evident that the acid had dissolved 135

                      is

54                    Experiments on Platina.
ascertain     with more certainty the nature of this powder, I
thought proper to make the following experiment.
     1 dissolved 200 grains of black powder well dried, but not
 calcined, in nitro-murialic acid of the fame strength. Having
 washed and weighed the residuum, it indicated that the sol
 vent had taken up onlv 24 grains. The solution being then
 treated with muriate of ammonia gave me common muriate
 of ammonia ; and the lad liquor produced, by the addition
 of potash, phosphate of iron, which gave me no new inform
 ation.
      But, if it be recollected that 200 grains of the black pow
 der, which had lost 23 grains of sulphur and phosphorus,
 afterwards suffered to be taken up by the same solvent even
  135 grains of platina, one will certainly be astonished to find
 that 200 grains of the fame powder, which still retained its
  23 grains of combustible matter, should have resisted the
  action of the solvent to such a degree as to give up to it only
  24 grains of metal. This resistance must necessarily find its
  measure in the difference between the numbers 135 and 24,
  which here represent to us the quantities taken from the black
  powder during the first and second experiments.
      I then suspected that the union of the combustibles accu
  mulated in the platina, formed, perhaps, the greatest obstacle
  to the solution, hoth in these experiments and in those made
  on platina on a large scale. Several facts, which I had already
  observed in regard to the solution of metallic sulphurets, com
  pared with that of their respective metals, confirmed me in
  this opinion, at least until other observations had enabled
  me to rectify what might not be founded on that conjecture.
      I therefore collected the powder, after the small loss it had
  experienced in the nitro- muriatic acid, and exposed it to the
  flame of the blowpipe. At the same instant it exhaled fumes
  of sulphur, and perhaps even of sulphuric acid, as dense as
  that which it had produced before being subjected to the
  action of the solvent. ¦ If we suppose, then, that the black
  powder gives up to the solvent 135 parts instead of 24, at the
  m nment when it is separated from the combustibles by tor-
  re adion, there remains no doubt that these combustibles,
  on the one hand, oppose a strong resistance to the action of
  ac ds, and defend the platina from it; and, on the other,
  th at ceconomy requires, in operations on a large scale, that
   the. black powder should be preserved separate, to be calcined
  before it is treated with nitro-muriatic acid.
       If we reflect that the sulphurets and phosphurets of iron,
  which are the only ores found in small quantity in the mi
  neral, are incapable of opposing such a resistance to the action
                                                                 of

Lt can, however, dissolve fulphuret of copper in various pro
portions, as may be seen in my essays on black copper.                  If
copper containing fulphuret be exposed to nitrous acid of iz
or 15 degrees *, the copper will be dissolved ; and fulphuret,
which will separate itself under the form of a blackish blue
powder, cannot be oxidated but in a very strong heat.
    I applied several times an acid of 35 degrees          f  to Ameri
can silver ore containing sulphurets of copper, lead, iron,
antimony, zinc, manganese, ice, and found that, if these
mixtures were net heated, the greater part of the metals were
attacked by the acid, the whole, or at least the greater part,
of the silver in the state of fulphuret excepted ; from which
we may conclude that this fulphuret is one of those which
resist the action of the nitric acid much more than the metal
itself.     It is very probable that this is the case with many
others, which I do not at present recollect.

            To the Editor     of the Philosophical Magazine.
           SIR,
 T.     HE      importance of the new mode of bleaching to the
 principal manufactures of this country renders it worthy the
 most minute and accurate attention. Before your publication of
 O'Reilly's Essay, no complete treatise on the modern system
 had appeared.         That of Berthollet, the discoverer, though in
 many particulars very defective, was undoubtedly the best
 adapted to instruct the practical manufacturer, who cannot be
 supposed intimate with the minutiae of the laboratory. The in-

definite essay of Higgins presupposes too much previous know
ledge in the reader, ever to enable the inexperienced to adapt
or establish the new process ; and the manv other detached
essays *, however valuable on particular parts, are yet far
from forming a whole, whence the practical bleacher might
gain instruction to adapt or improve this new system.               The
present    essay  not only  presents  a complete   view of all that  has
hitherto been published, but adds many original facts to the
illustration of the modus operandi, or theory and practice of
bleaching.       It is therefore with no inconsiderable deference
 that I venture to offer some remarks on the work of so expe
 rienced a chemist. *
     That there stiould still be such a diversity in the quantity
of the ingredients for preparing the oxymuriatous acid may
 appear strange, when its nature and properties are so well
 understood.       This may be accounted for only by the peculiar
 modes of preparing          for the end of all
                                    it,               the fame.   isThe
 first attempts to prepare this acid fit for bleaching often fail,
 and the cause of such failures, owing, perhaps, only to the
 want of manual dexterity,          generally ascribed to
                                              is             deficiency     a
 in the quantity of some of the ingredients. To remedy this
 supposed deficiency, an unnecessary quantity of some one ar
 ticle is  added    hence the German practice of using 64 parts
                       :
 salt to 20 manganese, when most probably the converse quan
tities, properly managed, would have much sooner produced the
 desired effect.     The use of salt in this process has, no doubt,
 hitherto been greatly over-rated.              does not appear that
                                                          It

                                              a
 minates by the formation of carbonic acid, which, escaping
 under the form of elastic fluid, produces what we call bleach
 ing.     Granting that combustion actually takes place, (in
 which there         no less of theory than experiment,) and the

attempts hitherto have done no more than dyeing a leaden
 white, which soon becomes a pale yellow, that requires ths
joint efforts of oxygen and alkalies to remove, must, on a
 moment's reflection, be evident to every one. To this cause
 may be ascribed the failure of the learned editors of the En
cyclopædia Britannica, who were no mean chemists. With
the acid prepared according to Berthollet's mode they dyed
 yellow, but could not bleach white.
    It is generally agreed, that the muriatic acid is no further
 useful to bleaching than by its power of retaining oxygen in
 water, and thus conveying it in a state fit to act, more or less,
 on both the external and internal parts of the stuff to be
 bleached.       Hence it is evident, that the use of such a quan
 tity of  salt is not only injurious to the celerity of the process,
 but entails an embarrassing expense on this method of bleach
 ing. However, even this more than triple quantity of salt
 may have been necessary to incorporate or retain the requisite
 quantity of oxygen to perform the whitening process, if the
 apparatus were not properly adapted.         Condensers have been
 generally    used, and Mr.  O'Reilly proposes (Plate I. fig. 1. C.*)
 an improved one; but, if duly examined, they will c>e found
 not only inefficacious, but highly disadvantageous to the ad
 mixture of the oxygen with the water. It is well known how
 slight the union of oxygen with muriatic acid is; and who
 ever will try even this improved condenser will find an almost:
 complete separation of the two gases before they are brought
 in contact with the water. So slightly indeed are they mixed,
 that the moment the heat and consequent motion is with
 drawn from these condensers, that moment the gases begin to
separate according to their specific gravities. At the top will
be found tolerably pure oxygen gas, while the bottom con
tains muriatic mixed with some sulphuric acid gas. This.
last combination is considerably detersive, but is also some
what corrosive, and has often damaged goods; a circum
stance that may be avoided by having them previously wetted
in water. It is less injurious, however, to cotton than linen
            and to this is owing probably the great quantity of
f;oods;
  ulphuric acid used at Manchester, where it- is diluted with
double its quantity of water ; which must excite such a rapid
ebullition, that some of the sulphuric acid will be carried
into the receiver.       Sulphuric acid, diluted with less than its
volume of water, will produce the purest oxymuriatic gas.
By using condensers, much of the oxygen too is dissipated
through the anti-absorbent tube            (if
                                            I  may    call

  58                    On Dyeing Cotton with the
  surprising that extraordinary quantities of muriatic acid
  should be required to retain a very small quantity of oxygen.
     To obviate the loss of the oxygen, and prevent the neces
 sity of using so much salt, the alembic and great receiving
 vat, or vats, stiould always communicate immediately toge
 ther, without the intervention of condensers, which always
 tend to diminish the capability of the muriatic acid to unite
 with and retain the oxygen in the water, and thus defeat the
 object of the process.         Absorption might be guarded against
 by having the communicating tube bent, like a double sy
 phon (IS), and in the lower angle to have an air-tight stop
 per, that would yield on the first pressure, so that no water
 could ever reach the alembic.             It ought to be remembered
 too, that if by neglect absorption ever takes place, the liquor
 will be rendered almost totally inert, even with the best con
 densers.      Various other modes of anti- absorption might be
 adapted equally efficient with those in use, and without their
 inconveniences.
     When citizen Paul thinks proper to publish his mode of
 impregnating water with oxygen, perhaps a still more speedy
 and effectual method of discharging the colouring matter of
 cotton and linci) mav be found ; and the theory or process of
 combustion, adapted by Berthollet in his " Elements of the
 Art of Dyeing," and ably combated by Dr. Bancroft* in
 his most ingenious " Researches in the Philosophy of per
manent Colours," be superseded by the more simple term
solution.

fame subject ; but my observations have not been anticipated
by his, since he tells us, that the method of dyeing cotton
and silk with these flowers is the fame, though it may be
easily proved that there is a very essential difference.           But,
before I give an account of my experiments, let me be per
mitted to make a few observations respecting the art of dyeing
cotton in general.
     No doubt can be entertained that it is more difficult to dye
cotton than to dve wooj or silk.       Every thing made of wool
readily imbibes the dye : silk imbibes it with more difficulty;
but cotton rejects all dyes so much, that those which imme
diately penetrate wool, and tinge it with a strong colour,
 scarcely communicate any tint whatever to the latter, and
 even the dye which adheres to it may be easily discharged,
 and oft-times by water alone.          For this reason, there is
scarcely any colour on cotton, except that called the Turkey
 red, which is either agreeable to the sight or of a durable
 nature.    But, if we wish to inquire into the cause of this difT
 fcrence, we must attend to the nature of the two substances.
     There can be no doubt that wool contains a larger quan
 tity pf fat, or inflammable matter, than cotton.            We have
 reason likewise to conjecture, that wool, and the hair of ani
 mals, have more and larger pores, as well as more capacious
 fibres, than those substances procured from vegetables.            The
 great object, then,   will be, to   remove    by  art  that difference
 which there is between animal and vegetable substances.
 That the smallness of the pores or fibres can be corrected by
  art, we have scarcely reason to hope : but we may make
  choice of colouring substances well diluted and soft, and as
  fluid and penetrating as possible, that     is, rather saline than
 earthy ;  and   may also prepare   or macerate    the cotton in such,
  liquors as are  capable of rendering   its fibres  softer and looser.
 Daily experience,    however,   sliows  that   much     cannot be ef
  fected in this manner; for though cotton,         by  means of salts,
  jnay be made to imbibe various dyes, yet they are easily

 washed       out and destroyed.         Let us try, then, if a method
  cannot be discovered to render the nature of cotton more
  like to that of wool.           This, indeed, will he the cafe, if we
 instil into it an oily substance so as to become a component
  part of       it,
                 which can neither be washed out with cold water
  nor soap, nor in any other manner.
      But as the Turkish red possesses all those qualities which
 are requisite in stuffs that have been dyed, this affords              suffi           a
 cient proof that cotton may be                 preparedso                by

 yellowish, and at length disappears.
     These experiment?, which              myself and many chemists
                                                   I
have tried, seemed to preclude all hope of dissolving and dis
covering the nature of that dye used                           by
                                                    the Turks, till        C.           J.
Oettinger, formerly professor at Tubingen, who has deserved
a so  well of chemistry, threw out some hints likely to lead to
    knowledge of it.         He, as far as know, was the first person
                                                       I
who had an opportunity of observing the great effect which
oil of olives has upon that Turkey dye. He found, that                                       if
cotton yarns dyed with were dipped in this oil, and then rub
                                         it
bed    a little, they lost their colour, and that the whole colour
                              thoroughly dissolved, that other threads
ing matter became                   so
could be dyed              that oily solution
                            in                       that, ;    the help of
                                                               so          by
oil, the dye on Turkish yarn could be transferred to other
undyed cotton.
     These observations afford grounds for various conjectures.
The colouring matter which the Turks use,                        perhaps of   is
such   a   nature as to be soluble          oil in the same manner as
                                                   in
resins ;    and perhaps the colouring matter adheres to vege
                                                                        table

                Flowers of the Carthamus Tinflorlus,          6t
table substances by means of some matter dissolved by the
oil. But the constancy of the colour in alkaline salts opposes
this conjecture ; and it is more probable that the Turks may
have dilcovered some method or assimilating cotton stusss to
those made of wool, and of thus rendering them more capable
than they naturally are of receiving the colouring substance.
    The celebrated professor Pallas proved, a few years ago*
that this conjecture is not only probable, but even true. This
gentleman, who, in travelling through the immense provinces
of the Ruffian empire, directed his attention not only to ob
serving and collecting animals, plants, and minerals, but also
to various uncommon processes employed by the inhabitants,
which might serve to improve the arts of Europe, was so for
tunate as to acquire a knowledge of the manner in which the
Armenians, who have retired to Astracan on account of the
continual troubles in Persia, dye cotton after the Turkisli
manner.        This process, which the professor communicated
to the public in 1776 in the Petersburgh Journal, I shall
not describe at full length, but only relate a few circum
stances that may serve to confirm my opinion, and to be a
guide to others in prosecuting experiments on this subject.
     The cotton yarn is steeped by the Armenians in fish oil.
 It is then dried in the open air, and this process is repeated
for seven days and nights.      The Armenians fay that no fish
oil can be used but that which assumes a milky appearance
by the addition of an alkaline solution.       I, indeed, suspect
that the fat of marine animals, and, in particular, fishes, is
much softer and more subtle, and penetrates solid bodies
much more easily than the fat of other animals ; and it is
for this reason, in my opinion, that the Armenians use only
 fifli oil, which can be readily proeured at Astracan.
     The yarn which has imbibed a sufficiency of oil is washed,
dried, and dipped in an astringent liquor in which there is an
 abundant mixture of alum.
     Cotton yarn thus prepared is dyed with the colouring
matter of madder which has been mixed with calves blood.
 In my opinion, the dye of the madder is not only heightened
 by the redness of the blood, but, as the red part of the blood
 is of an oily nature, as is proved by the red globules, which,
 by the help of a microscope, are seen floating on blood, it may
 facilitate tne entrance of the colouring matter into the pore9
 of the yarn, and the alkaline salt contained in blood acts
 strongly on the colouring particles of the madder, which it
 extracts, as I have already proved by experiments with alka
 line   salts.
                                                          When

  6t                    On Dyeing Cotton with tie
     When      the yarn is dyed, it is digested for 24 hours with
 a strong    solution of soda in an earthen jar placed over a fire.
 By these means the colour is more strongly saturated, as the
 alkaline salt renders most red colours more obscure or yellow;
 and, if there are any remains of oil, they are entirely ex
 tracted by the solution of soda*.
     What has been here said, is confirmed by the accounts
   iven of the method of dyeing employed in the East Indies ;
 I or, though it may appear somewhat different from that fol
 lowed at Astracan, yet the dyers there make use of animal
 oil or animal soap, which adheres to the dung of sheep and
 other animals t-
     Though there is no doubt that the method of dyeing de
 scribed by professor Pallas might be successfully imitated by
 our dyers, it is not my intention to make any trial on mad
 der, but rather to apply the principles, which I have already
 explained, to the use of the carthamus.                  For this reason, I
 subjected to experiments a piece of cotton cloth commonly
 called chintz, which was white, and had never been worn.
 I  washed carefully the flowers of the carthamus, that nothing
 of their yellow colouring matter might remain; after which
 I steeped them in an alkaline solution, and expressed the
juice. This expressed juice, which contained all the red dye
of the carthamus, and which I shall call the alkaline liquor,
 I tempered with the acid of lemon juice.
     1. Having melted hog's lard, I steeped the cloth in it for
two hours, and then washed it in cold water until scarcely
 any residuum of the fat substance was seen floating on the
surface.      I then steeped the cloth, after it was thoroughly
dried, in the alkaline liquor, and, when it was well satu
rated, I threw it into lemon juice, and repeated the same pro
 cess frequently.       I proceeded in the like manner with chintz,
which I had premacerated in water alone, and not with ani
mal fat ; but the latter imbibed much less of the colouring
matter : and this experiment, therefore, proves the advantage
 of using fat substances.
    2. In the like manner, I premacerated cotton cloth in a
solution of common soap, and, after it had boiled for some
hours, I dried it. This experiment also succeeded ; for the
    * For professor Pallas's account of the

 iii water alone.
       3. But common oil os olives is much superior to either
 hog's lard or soap.        I boiled cloth in this oil for three hours j
  [ squeezed out the oil, and washed the cloth in cold water
  till not a drop of oil seemed to be left in                           it,
                                                            though the smelt
  of remained.
    it                  I then dried the cloth cither above               stove             a
 ot in the open air; dipped            several times, alternately* in the
                                        it
  alkaline liquor and lemon juice and observed that there was
                                                  ;
a    very essential difference between the cloth which had, and
  that which had not, imbibed the oil. The one had assumed!
a     stronger and much better saturated colour; and the other
  one much weaker, and was, at the fame time, covered                    many               in
  places with various pale spots.           The cloth, also, which had!
  not yet imbibed oil, lost much of its colour in drying                    but              ;
  the colour of the other          in
                                   drying seemed to acquire strength.
I     learned also,     by
                         experience, that the whole process succeeds
   better, the oftener the cotton                thus dipped in oil and
                                                      is
  dried.     It    certain, also,
                  is               that   the  cloth    extracts some colour
   from the oil, and therefore                itnecessary that the latter

   watery colouring matter, which some might apprehend, that
it     rather strongly attracts         on account of the alkaline salt,
                                        it,
   which facilitates its entrance into the pores of the cotton.
       4. As these experiments had succeeded,                  endeavoured to
                                                                          I
   imitate with the carthamus, as far as possible, the process
   employed        bythe Armenians.          With this view, boiled                I                  a
   piece   of cotton  cloth  several  times                in
                                                   olive oil      then washed ;
   it thoroughly in cold water, and afterwards dried it. After
'
   this, I    mixed water impregnated with the yellow colour
   ing    matter   of the carthamus, or             yellow infusion of the

   carthamus, with pounded galls and alum.                          then took I
   cloth which had been premacerated in oil, and dipped                       in                 it
   this solution, after      had boiled
                             it               little, and found that the
                                                   a
    cloth, when wrung, was of              yellow colour.
                                              a                  Having dried
    the cloth,I    dipped     it   in
                                    the  cold   alkaline    liquor  of the car
    thamus, and then immersed                 in lemon juice; and this
                                                  it
    being frequently repeated, the cloth appeared of                  beautiful    a
    and Full red.     Cloth which had not been steeped in oil, but
    which in other respects had been exposed to the like pro

 which were premacerated in an astringent solution of alum.
 The cloth which had imbibed oil, and that which had not
 jmbibed     both stood alkaline falls; for these salts rendered
             it,
 the colour of both darker, without any other change. Nitric
 acid not diluted with water rendered the colour of both first
 brighter, then yellow, and at last destroyed              it
                                                           altogether.
 But still there was        great difference
                             a                : for the cloth which
 had been prepared with oil retained its colour much longer,
 and when washed in water, at the end of seven or eight mi
 nutes the colour returned, but of       violet hue; whereas cloth
                                          a
 prepared without oil lost its whole colour sooner.         The same
 acid diluted injured the latter, but not the former.             Even

 to remark, that acid vegetable juices do this dye no hurt. It
 sustains no injury from human urine, even            ifthe cloth be
 left init  for several days.    When exposed to the rays of the
 fun for some clays, these cloths suffered no injury, though
 that dyed without oil seemed to have lost more of its colour.
 But cloth which has even been prepared with oil, will not
 bear to be boiled with soap its colour first becomes violet,

    These few experiments so fully demonstrate the great ad
 vantage of oil in dyeing cotton, that no doubt can be enter
 tained of its utility.     must strongly recommend

 sooner absorbed, and in greater abundance,           by

 which effect uaTlv gains this end.
     The construction is extremely simple, and will                   be easily
 understood by the following              description,     and the plate to
 which it refers.
     Fig.   i.  (Plate i.) represents a vertical section, and fig. 2.
 a front view of a steam-engine boiler, fumislietl with one of
 Messrs. Roberton's furnaces; and the fame letters refer in
 both to the fame parts of the construction.
     The opening A, through which the fuel is introduced into
 the furnace, is shaped somewhat like a hopper, and is made
 of cast iron built into the brickwork H,H. From the mouth
it inclines downward to the place where the fire rests on the
 bottom grate B. The coals in this mouth-piece or hopper
 answer the purpose of a door *, and those lhat are lowest are
by this means brought into a state of ignition bef jre they are
forced into the furnace. Belaw the lower plate of the hopper
 K-, e the furnace is provided with front bars Gf> which
not only serve to admit air among the fuel, but offer a ready
way to force the fuel back, from time to time, from c to d %t
    '* In the management of this furnace, what is chiefly to he attended to
is, that the hopper be kept full of coal, and cither wholly or in part small
coal, to pi event, as much as possible, air getting in by that passage : it i' also
necessary at some times to use a (hatter of thin plate-iron, to be applied to
the mouth of the hopper to exclude the entrance of air by that palL.ge.
    f  These bars are, in fact, a grated doer, kept in their position by a
catch L, and which may be opened at pleasure for cleaning tlic fire out;
In small furnaces an opening here is all that is necessary : the ban may be
dispensed    with.
   J   Between the back end, d, of the bottom bars, and the breast brick
work b, is represented in the plate a sectio'n of a shutter, which, js some
times opened for the purpose of getting out the refuse of the fuel.

to make room for frefli quantities to fall into the furnace from
the hopper or mouth-piece.       By this arrangement the fuel
is brought into a state of ignition before it reaches the further
fide of the bottom grate, where it is stopped by the rising
breast, b, of the brick-work, so that any smoke liberated fro?n
the raw coals in the mouth-piece must pass over these burn
ing coals before it can reach the flue FFF. But this, though
it would cause a large quantity of the smoke to be burnt,
would not completely prevent the escape and ascent of smoke
up the chimney ; for it is not merely necessary that the smoke
 should be exposed to a heat sufficient to ignite it before it
 escapes : unless, at the fame time, a quantity of fresh air, able
 to furnish a sufficiency of oxygen for the combustion of the
 smoke, can be brought into contact with           will still escape

the engine, it would be actually impossible to know when it
is at work.
    These furnaces, we understand, have also been adopted by
many intelligent manufacturers at Leeds and at Manchester".
At   the latter place, if we may credit newspaper reports, se
veral manufacturers have had their works indicted as nui
sances for not having adopted the improvement ; the magi
strates arguing, that, though the welfare of the place required
 that such inconveniences stiould be submitted to while no
possible cure for them was known, the health and comfort df
the inhabitants equally demand, now that the evil can be
done away, that smoking furnaces should not be permitted in
the place.
    We earnestly recommend to owners of steam-engines, and
also to those who are annoyed by them, to endeavour to bring
this improvement into general use. Indeed, we entertain no
doubt of its being universally adopted sooner or later; for it
yields advantages not only in point of cleanliness, comfort,
and health, but also in point of interest — all the smoke usually
discharged at the top of the chimney, being, in fact, so much
good fuel, that only wanted the contact of fresh air to inflame
U under the boiler.    It is a fact well known, that the flame
which is often seen issuing from the chimneys of founders,
&c. has no existence except at the top of the chimney: while
ascending the flue it is only dense smoke, consisting of the
azote of the atmospheric air decomposed in passing through
the fire, of hydrogen, coal-tar, and carbonaceous matter* of
such a high temperature, that it only wants oxygen to make
it inflame spontaneously : this it obtains from the atmospheric
air into which it ascends, and then presents such appear
ances as would make a hasty observer adopt the opinion that

nace ; which is by no means the cafe.         A consideration of
this simple fact will convince any person that it is not an
inconsiderable proportion of the fuel that is thus wasted. Nor
is this the only loss sustained ; the quantity of heat required
not merely to render such a portion of the fuel volatile, but to
give to it a temperature able to produce the effect of which
 we have taken notice, is itself furnished at the expense of an
 extra and unnecessary quantity of fuel ! The whole waste in
 many cases         is,
                  we are persuaded, not less than an eighth of
 the whole  fuel employed.

not only of antelopes and wild horses, but also of wild asses,
which they met with in the neighbourhood of the lake Aral,
and in the course of their travels through the districts lying tq
the east of the Caspian sea.
    This imperfect information is almost the whole of what is
found in the modern travellers respecting the existence of the
wild ass in Asia, where this animal, in the time of the Ro
mans, was generally known, as far as Lesser Asia, Syria, and
Arabia     ||
              .  Respecting     those   in Africa our information is
equally deficient; and I can adduce no other testimony of
their existence in that country, than what is to be found in
Leo Africanus and Marmol. For those said to have existed
formerly in the Canaries in great abundance, were produced
from tame asses suffered to run wild, and are now entirely
destroyed If. The case was the fame with those which, ac

       Varro and Pliny speak of the onager as an animal very common in
Lesser Asia.    Xenophon, Suetonius, and Ammianns Marcellinus, give the
fame account in regard to Mesopotamia, Persia, and the king lom of Parthia.
Tacitus in his account of the Israelites fays, that during their journey
through the Arabian desert under the direction of Moses, they often fol
lowed the wild asses, by which means they were enabled to discover springs.
The Scripture also speaks of the wild ass as an animal very common in the
deserts bordering on Palestine.     None of the antient authors, however, ex
cept Oppian, has left us a precise description of the onager; but it clearly
appears from Oppian, that under this name the antients understood the wild
al's properly so called, which I have here described; and, in my opinion,
none but Philostorgius applies the above appellation to the zebra.

wandering Asiatic tribes, and from Ruffians and Tartars who
escaped from the slavery of these people, and also from Bu
chanan merchants who had travelled with the caravans,                        it
appears certain that         the districts of Great Tartary there
                                 in
are abundance of wild asses, which these people cal] kulan.
These animals proceed from the south in innumerable herds,
and spread themselves in the mountainous naked deserts lying
to the north and east of the lake Aral, where they feed during
the summer, and in autumn unite                hundreds, and even
                                                   in

me that traces of large herds, from two to three hundred

  flesh, for the roasted flesh of this animal is one of their dain
  ties; and indeed must not be ill tasted, since we learn from
  Pliny that the flesh of the young onager was much fought
  after by the Romans *.               On the other hand", the Persians
  rather try to catch the wild ass alive in pits carefuHy covered
 so as to conceal them, which they dig in the ground ; and,
  that the animal may not be injured, they fill the pits to a
  certain height with hay. The animals are driven- towards
 the places where such pits have been made, by a company of
 hunters who assemble for that design, and the young colts
 are fold at a high price to the. principal men of the country
 for the purposes of breeding.             From the wild colts caught in
 this manner are producecl those beautiful and active riding
 asses employed even in Persia, and in Arabia and Egypt, for
 travelling through the deserts, and which in the latter coun
 tries are fold sometimes for 75 ducats.                    According to the
 account transmitted to me by M. Niebuhr, there are many
 of these riding asses which, in point of colour, have a perfect;
 resemblance to the wild ass here described.                     Tavernier says
 that, in Persia, beautiful saddle asses arc dearer than the best
 horses, and often cost a hundred dollars \.                      lie makes an
 express distinction between them and the common breed of
afles, which abound in Persia as well as in Bucharia and
 China, but are employed only for the draught and for carry
ing burdens; and from the Persian custom which he men
tions of painting these saddle asses red, which is done also in
Egypt with iWkanna, we may perhaps be able to explain tho
fabulous account given by Æhan of the red-headed onager
    •  Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. viii. c. 44: — " The    best  onagers are fcjnd in

  Le Bruyn      and Adansonf praise also these riding asses pro
  duced     from wild asses, and they are extolled by all oriental
  travellers. They possess all the good properties of the wild race,
  from which thev are sprung; that beautiful figure on account
   of which Martial gives to the onager the epithet of fulcher
   great agility and fleetness in running.              Besides, they are
   hisrhly  valued   because   on   journeys through the desert coun
   tries they hold out much better than the Tartar hoises, and
   advance with an uniform pace at a sailer rate than even the
   camel J.
       The (lie ass brought to Peterfburgh, a representation of
   which in two positions is annexed, (fee Plate II.) had not
   attained to her full growth, and in all probability continued
   so weaklv because (he had been caught young and badlv taken
   care of. She, however, was able to perform the journey from
   Astracan to Moscow, in summer, which is more than two
   hundred German miles, continually trotting behind the pod-
  waggon without retting more than two nights ; and though
   she had suffered considerably b\ sometimes falling down and
   being dragged behind ihe carriage, (lie had sufficient strength,
   after a short stav at Moscow, to travel two hundred miles
   further to Petei (burgh : when she arrived there, indeed, she
   was exceedingly meagre and in bad condition, and could
   scarcely stand on her legs.        She died towards the beginning
.  of autumn ; but rather in consequence of the cold, and damp
   ness of the climate, together with change of food and the
   means employed to cure an eruption, which had broken out
   on he- skin in consequence of being overheated on the journev.
   Notwithstanding this malady, she recovered her strength so far
   as to show, in part, her former agility, and that she possessed
   properties very superior to common astes.               But the damp
   ness of autumn was evidently injurious to her; for when (lie
   went out into the wet fields her hoofs soon split, and at
   length dropped from her feet.
        All the Tartar tribes consider the wild ass as one of the
   swiftest of animals, and unanimously assert, that the fleetest
   of their horses are unable to keep pace with this light and
    (lender animal.       We are told by Xenophon that the wild

       % Niebuhr estimates the distance which a riding ass can travel with an
   uniform pace in half an hour to be 1750 paces — double those of a man ;
   whereas the largest camels can travel only 1,7;, and the dromedary 1500
   at most. See his SUixx ir. Arabun, p. j 11, 312.
                                                                        asle3

the edges.
   As the wild ass frequents the dry southern districts, and
never wanders so far north as the wild horse, herds of which
are found under the 56th degree of latitude, the tame ass
does not thrive so well in the damp northern districts as the
horse ; and this, together with want of care, excessive labour,
and bad nourishment, may have occasioned the degeneration
of the common ass, and brought this breed into discredit.
But who judge of the noble breed of our best horses from the
wretched animals in the poorer districts, which are scarcely
so good as asses ? With proper care and management, might
not as good riding asses be bred in the temperate and southern
parts of Europe, as in the East? and might not the breed of
this animal be gradually improved as we have improved the
horse, the wild breed of which are far inferior in size and
beauty ?    In regard to the viciousness of the ass, and par
ticularly its obstinacy, which is inherited by the mule, it
appears to me very probable that this is owing to the too
wide conformation and sensibility of the organs of hearing
which nature has bestowed on the wild race, which, being
destined to live in extensive deserts, have need of being able
to discover danger at a greater distance.      The noise which
the ass must hear in the neighbourhood of men evidently
stuns it ; and, on that account, it is customary in England to
crop the ears of the asses employed at mills, because it is
known that by these means thev become much more tract
able and obedient.      Means might easily be discovered of
weakening their hearing, and accomplishing the same end,
without such a mutilating operation.
   By improving the breed of asses, which, after the example
of the antients, might be done soonest, and in the most com
plete manner, by introducing riding asses from the Levant,
           3                                                 or

  74                    On the Onager     of the Antients,
  or colts   of the wild breed, the breed of mules, so useful for
  carrying burdens, would also be much improved.                    Varroand
  other antient authors, who treat of agriculture and the breed
  ing of cattle, unanimously assert that, in their time, the best
  mules were produced from a mare and the onager, or wild ass.
  The Persian mules, the strength and courage of which are
 extolled by Le Bruyn *, are in all probability produced in the
  fame manner. These qualities, perhaps, might be obtained in
  a higher degree if the djbiggetai, or great Mogul wild ass,
  which exceeds the onager in size and beauty f, and perhaps
 also in sleetness, could be once tamed, and employed for this
 purpose.
      The wild ass, in its habits and mode of life, approaches
 near to the djbiggetai and wild horse.                They rove about in
 herds, which consist of young colts of both sexes, under the
 protection of a stallion.            The fame account is given by
 Oppian and Pliny, and by those who have copied them.
 But it appears that at the periods of their migration the stal
 lion lays aside his jealousy, and several herds then unite to
 gether. The season of covering is then past, and the females
 are big with young ; yet the stallions, even then, are accus
 tomed to bite and Rick each other very much.
     Their hearing and sight are so acute, and the weather is so
fine, that in the open fields it is not possible to approach
them. The Kirgisians, therefore, endeavour to conceal them
 selves in the districts through which they pass, or in the
neighbourhood- of the salt lakes, which they frequent ; but
the kulans seldom drink, and often not in the course of two
days. The ass which I had in my possession frequently ab
stained from drinking for two days, and in particular when
a heavy dew, or light shower of rain, had fallen.                    She- was
    • Le Bruyn
                   fays in his Travels above quoted, p. 139, that in the south
ern parts of Persia there are mules which, from natural instinct, like lorn'
spirited horses, and the stallions among the wild horles, attack bears and
other ravenous animals with great courage, and knock them down with
their fore-feet. The unfortunate swine, which in these districts are black,
and covered wi'h very rough bristles, fall sometimes a sacrifice to this, im
pulse of thr ntules, which ate not always nble to distinguish them from dan
gerous animals.      A circumstance of a similar kind is mentioned by Varro,
lib. ii. c. 3 : — " I once saw the horse of a C'almuc Tartar, while the ridi r
was on his back, rush into a field and kill a breeding bustard, which he,
110 doubt, tcok for some savage animal."       This kind of instinct seems to
be common also to the wild asses, which, according to the account given
by rhe Kirgisians, attack wild animals in a body.       When cue of them ob
serves a snake, it immediately give* the signal by a loud cry; upon which
all the- rest assemble, and each of them tries which shall first destroy the
dangerous reptile.      They do the fame in regard to such ravenous animala,
as they ar able to oveicome ; but the tiger is too much for them.
    t  For a description of this animal see Philosophical Magazine, vol. ii.
                                                                       fonder,

like;  and after these, the different kinds of clover, lucern, all
leguminous plants, especially when given her with the grain,
and dog's grafs. She was fond also of green cucumbers; and
some vegetables, such as different kinds of pulse, which she
did not relish when green, (he ate readily when dried.          On
the other hand, (he had an aversion to all sweet-smelling bal
samic plants which are eaten by the tame ass, such as mud-
wort, ranunculus, nettles, and all hard and prickly- plants,
and even thistles.    In Persia, the young kulan colts, when
caught, are first tamed by feeding them with rice, oats, wheat
straw, and bread. The wild ass eats with great avidity a plant
very common in the southern part of Tartary, and to which
the Bueharians give the name of burogan.
   The ass I here speak of was exceedingly tame, and, like a
dog, followed without any compulsion those who fed her and
      her drink. She could be made go any where merely
  y the smell of bread ; but if any one attempted to lead her
save
by a halter, contrary to her inclination, she showed as much
obstinacy as a mule.      She would not suffer any one to -stand
behind her ; and when touched with the hand or a stick bn
the back or thighs she threw out her heels, with a loud snort
ing, like that emitted by a stallion when he kicks.
   The male which died on the journey from Persia was
much larger. According to Mr. Hablizl's measurement, his
length from the ears to ihe rump was 4 feet 10 \ inches ; the,
height before, 4 feet 2 inches 8 lines ;. behind, 4 feet 6 inches
6 lines; the length of the head 2 feet; of the ears, 11 finches;

and the tail, with the bush at the extremity, % feet 1 inch.
The length of the female, however, was only 3 feet 10 inches;
the height before, 3 feet 4 inches 8 lines ; behind, 3 feet
 6 inches ; length of the head, 1 foot 6 inches ; the tail,
 jOj inches; the bush at she end of the tail, 8 inches 5 lines;
the ears, 7 inches 5 lines; and stie weighed, when the bowels
were taken out, only about 165 pounds apothecaries weight.
The male was also much more strongly made in the neck,
limbs, breast, and rump; and was distinguished from the
           4                                                 female

  female by a small stripe over the shoulders crossing that on
  the back, which was warning in the female, the latter having
  only the stripe on the back. This cross is much more com
  mon among the tame asses, and is observed, in particular, on
  those which are of a bright colour.          The Kirgisians fay, that
  among      the' wild  asses  the  cross  stripe is found sometimes
 double.
     The onager is much taller and finer limbed than the com
  mon ass.      The female in my possession was so narrow in the
  chat and rump, that behind (he had the appearance of a
 young silly, as may be seen in the plate.           Like young filliis,
  also, ssie  could scratch   her head  and  neck  with  the hind foot,
 which a full grown horse cannot do. On the fore-legs ssie
 appeared very weak; but flie could carry on her back the
 heaviest man, and even run with him.             She always held her
 head crc6t, in a more graceful manner than the common ass;
 kept her ears always upright, even during illness; and in all
 her motions ssiowed great agility.
     The head of the onager is higher and larger than that of
 the djbiggetii, and jet I found the skull, when cleaned, to
 be remarkably light.         The head is much bent, like that of a
 ram: the fore-part between the eyes is flat; but above the
 eve-sockets, which are as strong as those of old horses, it is
 elevated in a flattifh round form.            The lips are very thick,
 and to the very edges closely covered with stiff hair like bris
 tles, which towards the round part of the mouth lie crooked.
The nostrils do not form that excrescence- like elevation which
 is peculiar to the Jjliggetdi. The pupil of the eye is yellowish
brown.        The cars at the points are quite black, covered on
 the inside with curled hairs that cross each other, which grow
partly on both edges of the ear, and partly on three ndges
which run along the hollow of the ear lengthwise.
     The colour on the muzzle and the greater part of the bod v
is a beautiful white, with a kind of silvery appearance; but
the upper part of the head, the sides of the neck, and the
 rump, are of a pale isabella colour.           This colour does not
extend along the fore- thighs; it however covers the haunches;
although on the sides of the belly a white space, of about a
hand breadth, separates the colour of the belly from that of
the thighs : a white band, also, runs along each side of the
stripe on the back, and unites itself to the white part of the
lower belly.       Oppian has expressed very accurately this white
separation, in his poetical description of the onager. The
mane, which is blackissi brown, begins between the ears and
 extends to the shoulders ; it consists of soft woolly hair from

the common ass is round, I found in the wild ass to be
longisli, but not perfectly oval.               The hoofs of all the four
feet have in the place of the spur an elevation covered with
a horny skin.      The hoofs are almost round, and have deep
cavities on the soles.
   The hair of the onager, and particularly in the winter,
is much silkier and softer than that of the horse : it may be
compared to the best camel's hair.                    The winter wool is
matted, has an oily touch, and where the isabella colour pre
vails, that colour is much paler, a few places excepted, where
it is (haded in a different direction, and particularly according
to the lines exprefled in the figure.
    In the onager I counted only sixteen articulations of the tail ;
the others were in number equal to those of the common ase.
 It had only thirty-two teeth, viz. in each jaw fix grinders
very much used, and in each side row five cheek-teeth.                       In
the interior parts I could observe no further difference be
tween them and those of the common ass than are often to
 be found in animals of the fame species.                 In the great gut I
 found very large worms (afcaris pollicaris), such as are fre
quently found in horses ; and here and there in the small
 guts some asoarides, smaller than those common in man.
 Those writers also who assert that the ass is never infested by
 external vermin, must not extend this observation to the
 wild ass ; for the one here described was so covered with a
 fort of small lice, that the hair seemed as if strewed over with
 them.
    I have already said that the Kirgifians prefer the flesti of
 the kulan to all other game, and even to that of their young
 horses, of which they are so fond. The fame taste seems to
 prevail among the Arabs*; and the writers of that nation, in
 regard to this food, make the fame distinction between the
 wild and tame ass as the Hebrews made between both ani-

   The (kin of the wild ass is highly valued by the Buchanans
for making shagreen.          Rauwolf says the fame thing of the
Syrian wild ass, the skins of which are brought to Tripoli for
sale.    Those, however, who have hitherto believed that the
skin of the wild ass is grained of itself, and like a natural kind
of shagreen, or that shagreen can be made of no other skin
than that of the wild als, are much mistaken ; yet this er
roneous opinion         to be found in some modern writers, and
                      is-

stones found in the wild asses, and of which Bauhin, in his
Latin Treatise on^ the Bezoar, distinguishes two kinds,                      I
can fay nothing: they are the stones, perhaps, found in
the common ass or mules, which, in order to give them
greater importance, are pretended to be those of the above,
animal, in the fame manner as stones cut from horses are
brought from ^Persia and India under the name of Gar-

  curred to me, which I thought might be applied with great
  advantage not only to the situation I had in view, but in all
  other cases of low falls. Some circumstance, however, pre
  vented me at the time from putting it in practice; but I had
  afterwards, at different times, two models of it made ; and in
  November 1799 sent up the accompanying description of it to
  my friend Mr. Mundell, of Fludyer-street, requesting him to
  give it to the public.    Upon some after reflection, howevc r,
  I conceived it best, for some time, to delay its publication ;
  and accordingly till now have allowed-it to lie dormant.
     Soon after finishing the drawing referred to in the de
  scription, I thought the particular form of buckets there re-
. presented might De a little altered, so as to make them still
  more advantageously contain the water.        Upon showing the
  alteration I proposed to my ingenious friend Mr. John Ro
  be rton of this place, he was at considerable pains to inves
  tigate the subject, and pointed out the form of buckets re
  presented in fig. 3.
     Allow me further to direct your attention to the construc
  tion of the arms shown in the figures.          It is applicable to
  any kind of water-wheel ; and since 1790, when I first con
  structed a wheel with arms on that principle, a considerable
  number of large wheels have, in Scotland, been erected oh
  that plan.    I shall annex a short description of this construc
  tion of arms.
                           I remain,

     It  has been ascertained, from the most accurate experi
  ments on water-wheels, that under the fame circumstances
                                                                   an

   an overshot produces about double the effect            of  an undershot
   wheel.
      Hence it is obvious, that where water can be made to act
   on a wheel by weight, it is much more effectual than when
   the fame water is made to act by impulse.
      But where the fall is less than about half the diameter of
  a wheel with buckets made in the usual form, the difficulty
  of filling them, and the short time they are able to retain the
  water, are such great defects, that in such cases wheels with
  open float boards, on which the water acts partly or altoge
  ther by its impulse, have been found in practice to be more
  advantageous.
      It occurred to me however, that, by adopting another form
  of the buckets, they might be so made as to be easily filled,
  and at the fame time capable of retaining the water in a situa
  tion to produce nearly its full effect, altogether by weight, on
  a low fall.

      A wheel of the construction mean is represented in the
  figures.    Contrary to the usual practice, the water must here
  be poured into the buckets from within the shrouding*.
      How the filling of the buckets from within can be accom
 plished, may not at first be obvious ; but a slight inspection,
 of the figure will mow that it may be done without the pen-
 flock interfering with the arms of the wheel.
     The buckets in the figure empty themselves by means of
 apertures the whole length of the buckets, but no wider than
just sufficient to discharge the water before they begin t»
 ascend.

   But as    received only one memoir on the subject, which
                  it
was not satisfactory,   the class proposes the fame question for
the year 1803, with this express condition, that " those who

     The Mathematical Class has also repeated, for 1802, the
 following question, with a double prize. :
     " As there still remain, notwithstanding the labours of the
 ablest astronomers,      several points to be cleared up in regard

 and will adjudge     the  prize to that memoir which shall con

                                 Antiquities.
    The     names of two celebrated cities, Herculaneum* and
Pompeii       f,  have often inflamed with a noble emulation the
amateurs of antiquities and antient monuments.                        Hitherto
the total disappearance of these two cities has been ascribed
to the famous eruption of Vesuvius in the first year of the
reign of Titus, and the 79th of the Christian æra.                     Accord
ing to the observations of'C. Du Theil, this epoch is not cer
tain; for these two cities rose again from their ruins under
the reign of that prince; and they still existed, with some
remains of splendour, under Hadrian.                       The beautiful cha
racters of the inscription traced out on the base of the eques
trian statue of M. Nonius Balbus, son of Marcus, are an
evident proof of its existence at that period. They were found
under the reign of the Antonines; for the account of Tri-
malchio's feast, in the satirical romance ascribed to Petronius
Arbiter, furnishes several evidences of the existence of Pompeii,
and of some of the edifices of Herculaneum, under the last of
these princes.        In the geographical monument known under
the name of Pcutinger's chart, which is of a date posterior to
the reign of Constantmc, that is to lay, in the commence
ment ot the fourth century, Herculaneum and Pompeii were
still standing, and then inhabited ; but in the Itinerary im
properly ascribed to Antoninus, neither of these two cities is
noticed ; from which it may be conjectured, with some de-
       of foundation, that the entire ruin of Herculaneum and
  ompeii must have taken place in that interval, between the
free
time when Pcutinger's chart was constructed and that when
the above Itinerary was composed.

dreadful ravages.        If We can give credit to Marcellinus, the
ashes  thrown    up by Vesuvius covered all Europe.          They were
carried  as far as  Constantinople ; where, according to our chro
nicler, an anniversary festival was instituted in remembrance
of this strange phænomenon.                It is very probable that the
 cities of Herculane.um and Pompeii disappeared at that pe
riod, and that no more traces of them were left. This con
jecture is supported bv a letter written by Caffiodorus in the
name ofTheodoric, who reigned between 493 and 526.                  On
 this authority    C.    Du  Theil  is inclined   to think that,   after
 the fatal eruption of 471, such os the inhabitants of Pom
peii as had the good fortune to escape alive, retired to Nola
in Campania, and that those who escaped from Hercula-
neum took shelter at Naples.            The quarter where the latter
established themselves was detached from the other parts of
the city.
    This may serve to explain the denomination Regio Hcrcu-
lanenjium, or the quarter of the Herculaneans, which has
been observed on several monuments of stone dug up at Na
ples, and also in several inscriptions, which have been col
lected and published by learned Neapolitan antiquaries.
    After Du Theil had read this memoir, he communicated a
notice respecting some objects of antiquity latelv found near
the small town of Azai-le-Nideau, on the left bank of the
Indre. The account of them was transmitted to him by
 C. Biencourt. Some workmen, when dinging a ditch, dil-
covered a coffin containing a voting child, as was concluded
from its teeth, cranium, and ribs; but the red had suffered so
much from the injuries of time, that it fell into dust when
exposed to the air.        At the fide of this body were the follow
ing objects   : —  1. Two   poniards, one of iron, the other of ivory,
half destroyed : 2. A gold bulla shaped like an acorn — a badge
worn by the children of Roman patrician families : 3. A small
jasper ring set in gold, on which are engraven two veiled
figures: 4. A ring entirely of rock crystal.            It has engraven
on it two rams yoked to a car: a small Cupid sitting in the
car urges them on full speed.          This engraving displays much
grace   and   spirit.    5. A  crystal  ring imitating a row of pearls
surmounted with a shell : 6. A prism of twenty planes, of
rock crystal, very regularly cut : 7. Four lachrymatories of
glass: 8. Several figures sculptured in ivory, and almost de
composed : 9. A young Cupid also of ivory, prettv well pul
verized.     In the same tomb were found several works com
posed   of resinous    substances, which time seems to have re-
ipected.     1. A   lion  holding under his paws a dog, the head
            4                                                         of

                    French National Institute.                   85
of which      he is devouring: 2. Another piece of sculpture re
presenting a car drawn by an old goat.           A Cupid sitting in
the car makes a sign to the goat to advance, and threatens
him with a whip which he holds in his hand.               Before the
car a young woman is seated without vestments, and behind
it is an old man clothed in a long robe.         This piece shows a
great deal of expression.         3. A  silver cup,  the bottom of
which is oxidated : rings and broaches of metal, on which
are filed resinous perfumes.       The description of these articles,
which C. Biencourt will soon transmit to the Institute, must:
be highly interesting to artists and antiquaries.
    C. Mongez, always employed in researches respecting the
costume of the antients, has been endeavouring to discover
and describe the different substances which they employed
for their vestments, arms, 8cc. Particular reasons have in
duced him to detach from his work an effav on the use which
the antients made of hemp. Hesiod and Homer do not men
tion this vegetable.         Herodotus fays that it resembles flax,
from which it differs only in size and in height. The appear
ance of these two plants, however, is marked with such a
striking difference, that the father os history, since he speaks
so incorrectly, must have never seen hemp.           He nevertheless
tells us, that the Thracians procured from the northern coun
tries of Europe the hemp which they employed to make cloth
 for their vestments.
     Aristophanes speaks of a hemp merchant ; and we know
that the Greeks used hemp for cordage, and for caulk
 ing their vessels. But they did not then cultivate this pro
 duction, for it is not mentioned by Theophrastus; and Hiero
 procured hemp from the northern countries of Europe ; that
 is to fay, from the banks of the Rhodanus, which throws it
 self into the Vistula, and which he calls, improperly, the
 Eridanus.        It is still from Russia and Livonia that Europe
 is supplied with hemp : it is very probable that it was not
 cultivated by the Greeks till about the commencement of the
 Christum æra.
     The Romans, like the Greeks, employed this substance for
 cordage, and for caulking their vessels; but neither of them
 manufactured sail-cloth of     it,   if we are to judge from the
  Greek and Roman wiiters whole works have been preserved.
  C. Mongez has been obliged to descend from Herodotus, in
 his passage respecting the Thracians, to the 12th century, to
 finda     passage which makes mention of hempen cloth.         It   is
  still in
         a    northern country, viz. England, that he found it.
      In the 13th    century, and the following ones, hempen cloth
                               F  3                          became

 hecame    very common in the middle and southern parts of
 Europe. There can be no doubt that the remains of this
 cloth, employed with those of linen for making paper, then
 introduced into Europe, contributed to preserve the antient
 authors whose works were effaced ; that the fame parchment
 might be employed for the books of the church and treatises
 of theology. Moncez concludes his researches'by comparing
 the passages in antient authors, where mention is made of
 torrefied hemp-feed, with the smoke of which barbarous na
 tions got intoxicated, and the practice still common in Egypt
 and Asia of chewing these seeds for the like purpose.
    The Class of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences had
 proposed in the year 8, as the subject of a prize, to be ad
judged on the 7th of October 1801, the. following question :
    " To point out the earthy substances, and the processes
proper for making earthen -ware capable of standing a sudden
 transition from heat to cold, and which may be within the
reach of all classes of people."
    This question was accompanied with the following notice :
— The art of manufacturing that valuable pottery known
under the name of porcelain has been brought to a degree of
perfection in France which leaves nothing more to be desired \
but the cafe is not the fame with the common pottery em
ployed for daily use: the latter is far from being carried to
that degree of increase and prosperity so necessary for the
¦wants of the great body of the people; while some neigh
bouring nations, who do not make so fine porcelain, manu
facture very useful potterv, the properties of which are far
superior to that made in France.     The Institute requires that
the competitors will examine the composition of these excel
lent kinds of pottery, the earths which may be employed in
the composition of them, and the artificial mixtures which
might be substituted in their stead: the manner in which
these earths ought to be treated to give them the necessary
qualities; the art of baking them; the degree of heat; the
form of the furnaces most advantageous ; and, in particular,
the processes for glazing pottery without oxides and per
nicious metals.
    The class received only one memoir on this subject, ac
companied with several specimens of pottery, and of the
earths of which they were made.       It found that the memoir
was written in a clear and methodical manner; that it con
tained principles acknowledged by philosophy and chemistry;
and that the details, serving to illustrate them, announced
long practice in the art of pottery, together with great theo

retical knowledge : but as the specimens which accompanied
this memoir did not answer the object; pointed out by the
class, it has prolonged the term for adjudging the prize to
the 3d of October 1802, strongly recommending to the can
didates to apply with particular care to this branch of manu
factory.
    This double prize, of the value of 6800 francs (above 280/.
sterling), will he adjudged in the sitting of the Institute at
the above period.
    The Class of Literature and the Belles Lettres proposed in.
the year 8, as the subject of a prize in antiquities, the fol
lowing question   :
    " What are      the studies which form, and the kinds of
knowledge which characterize, the antiquary ? What ad
vantages ought to arise to society from such knowledge?"
    On account of the importance of this subject, the class has
thought proper to prolong the period of receiving memoirs
till the 3d of October 1802, as before.
    The prize will be a gold medal of the value of five hecto
grammes, and will be adjudged in the public sitting of Ja
 nuary 5, 1803.

     M. Chenevix has had under examination a specimen of
 manacbanite from Botany Bay.              It differs from the Cornish
  in containing a white quartzy sand. It yielded on analysis,

      It  is difficult to obtain this metal reduced and pure ; but
   by mixing the oxide of titanium with glass of phosphorus
   and charcoal, and then employing a flux of borax, a button
  of phofphuret of titanium may be obtained.
      If the mineralogical riches of New Holland may be judged
   of from the valuable productions with which we have become
   acquainted already, we may look forward to many interesting
   discoveries: already a metal is found to be a native of those
   climates which has not long been known, and has been but
   rarely met with in Europe.

                  CHEMICAL NOTICES.
    Some experiments made by Mr. Carlisle   prove that sul
phurated hydrogen gas is not evolved from eggs unless they
are heated in water, and this by the decomposition of the
water used.
    A person     in the colour line, on the continent, having mixed
coarse Prussian blue and nut oil for a blue colour,              covered
them with water, and left them till wanted.                  On going to
use   it,he found       changed to white

some was laid on white paper, some on wood, and some on

to the blue colour; but they all became        strong blue.

 than  a double quantity of the oxygenated muriatic acid gas

experiment: — Fill a vessel, of about the capacity of three
pints, with oxymuriatic gas ; fee that it is drained from the
water in it ; then throw into it about a dram of good ether,
and cover the vessel with a piece of paper.    In a few seconds

be followed by an explosion and flame, and a large quantity
of carbon will be deposited.

    Mercier has quoted a work, published 27 years ago, which'
contains the principle of galvanism.       Twelve years before,
the celebrated Sulzer discovered this principle, and obtained
the fame result.      " If you join," says he, " two pieces of
metal, one of lead and the other of silver, in such a manner
that their edges form one plane, and if they be placed upon
the tontrue, a taste of the vitriol of iron will be felt, while
each piece separately leaves no trace of taste." — Smith's Post

    A   very strong leaden pipe, which conveyed water into a
bason in the garden of the palace of the Conservative Senate,
the ci-devant Luxembourg, and which has not been in ex
istence    for 30 or 40 years past, has lately been discovered.
This pipe contained a sediment deposited by the water,
which, hardened by time, had become stone, or rather free
stone, sufficiently close to strike fire with steel without the
lead which contained it being in any manner altered.        Had
the workmen taken the precaution to remove the lead with
out touching the matter, they would have preserved a curiosity
unique in its kind; a natural pipe from 2500 to 3000 feet
long, of the most compact freestone, and an inch and a half
in thickness. In its whole diameter there were counted about
fifty concentric strata or coats.

 pleasant thing imaginable, to see the men, their wives and
children, gathering the produce of their little farms, which
is  to serve them the ensuing winter.      Was this plan gene
rally adopted, the labourers would consume but little corn;
which would supply the manufacturing towns, and we should
 have no occasion to import.     As four acres are sufficient for
 thirty families,    would take but

  SINGULAR PHÆNOMENON AT COLNEBROOK DALE.
  On Sunday, the 7th of September,                     a   most tremendous fall
of rain, accompanied with thunder,                     raised the river             Colne
to such    height,
           a                as to make   it    reach   one    of    the blast-fur
naces,  belonging to the Colncbrook Dale company,          the                      by
overflowing ot the clams.   The instant the water entered the
furnace,     dreadful explosion took place, and
               a                                    column of        a
melted and red-hut mineral was discharged into the air,                                  in   a
perpendicular direction, upwards of 130 feet.    The explosion
was repeated at intervals for two or three times, accompanied
each time     an extremely brilliant column, the heat of which
                   by
was   so intense, as to be felt several hundred yards distant.
The roofs and floors of the contiguous buildings were dis
placed     by
            the concussion.         remarkable, that the pro

                                                                                     iron-

      particulars respecting the             savage of
                           avevron:
Ex traded from     the Report made to the  National Institute by
                       Citizen Degerando.
    When the young creature, known        by the name of the
Savage of Aveyron, was discovered in      the forest of Canni,
and brought to Paris by the professor Bonatecre, the public,
for a considerable time, echoed with this intelligence.       It
occupied the idle, attracted the curious, and gave rife to a
multitude of discussions, which were at least premature, as
they could then have no foundation but conjecture.
    In the mean time, the public, who ran in crowds to fee
this child, were astonished to behold in him only a being,
nearly insensible, which appeared neither to hear nor to see,
which gave no signs of attention, and appeared to have no fort
of active principle. Thus the interest which he excited be
came extinct as soon as it was raised.
    The spirit of system then passed a new sentence on him.
Some persons, according to whose opinions the savage state is
not only the primitive, but also the most perfect state of man,
were surprised that this child of nature corresponded so ill
with their ideas; and, dreading that he would completely
overturn their hypothesis, they hastened to secure themselves
from any conclusion that might be deduced from him by
declaring that he had been born a fool.
   Superficial minds confirmed this sentence. The savage of
Aveyron resembled a fool ; it was therefore easy to conclude
that he was a fool ; and, what lent a strong confirmation to
this opinion was, that Pinel, a physician, who has acquired a
high reputation by his successes on persons of disordered in
tellects, having accurately examined all the circumstances
                                                      connected

94                  The Savage    of Aveyron,
connected with the physical and moral state of this boy, and
having compared them with those of the idiots confined at
the hospital of the Salpetriere, found such a perfect coin
cidence between them, that he thought himself justified in
declaring this creature a natural idiot.
    But a few philosophers still opposed themselves to a decision
so precipitate and severe. They thought it possible that the so
litary and brutal life of the savage of Aveyrm might have pro
duced a sort of habitual idiotism, the appearances of which
might be similar to those os natural idiotism ; and they held
it extremely unjust to condemn the creature for ever, and
extremely unwise to leave so extraordinary a phænomenon
totally unexplained ; at the same time they suggested the
means that thev conceived would be most effectual to rouse
his faculties and unfold his understanding, if in reality he
had any. Locke and Condilhac had already given the idea
of these means.      Previous to any attempt to produce con
nection of ideas, the ideas themselves should be created ; in
order to create the ideas, the attention should be fixed ; and,
in order to fix the attention, the wants and necessities of the
person should be interested.     They did not wish to teach him
the use of signs, before he could have acquired those notions
which these terms are intended to express; they wished to
work on his sensibility, to direct it to its proper objects, and,
by the formation of new habits, to counteract thole depraved
ones by which he had already been enslaved.        They saw that
a long time would be required to excite in him attention to a
¦world in which he was a stranger, and regard for objects in
which he had been, and was yet, totally uninterested : but
they resolved to apply themselves with industry, and to await
the effect with patience.
    The boy was committed to the care of C. Ytard, physician
of the National Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in order
 that, by the combination of physical and modern remedies,
the double incapacities under which he laboured might be
 more effectually removed. C. Ytard's exertions have already
been crowned with a degree of success which is almost pro-          .
digious : he has publissied the particulars, which he has de
 dicated to the National Institute.
    He proceeded nearly in the following order : —The sense of
 feeling seemed to be entirely paralysed in the child : be showed
 no sensibility either to heat or cold ; his smell and t»;e were.
 plunged in a similar sleep.     A icpetition of warm baths soon
 unfolded his nervous sensibility : in a little time after, his
 feeling acquired a considerable degree of delicacy ; he became
 nice in the choice of his food j he made use of a selection and
                                                      a cleanliness

                      The Savage of Aveyron.   _•             95
a cleanliness in it to which he had been before a stranger :
his choice was directed by the smell.
     The eye of this child was wild and wandering: he saw,
without doubt, but he never dwelt on the object. The loudest
noises appeared scarcely to strike his ear; a pistol shot would
not make him turn his head.          Superficial observers would
have concluded that he was deaf; but C. Ytard was aware
that, even when the fense is perfect, no perception is pro
duced unless the mind is attentive; and he was not asto
nished that the violence of this found made 110 impression on
a being whom it could not interest.       He found a new proof
of the justness of his observation in the attention which his
    upil bestowed on the smallesti found which could intercst-
Eim, such as the cracking of a nut, or the turning of a key.
     In the mean time new habits were formed in the hoy ; a
 number of new necessities arose; food, dress, rest, and walk
 ing out, were so many new means of augmenting his depend-
 ance.     Finding himself under the necessity of availing him
 self of those about him, he has begun to feel the force of
 moral affections, and has conceived a particular attachment
 to his governess.     His ideas have been multiplied and con
 nected ; some efforts have been made to amuse him, and it
 is contrived to unite instruction with amusement.         He has
  been exercised at comparisons; they have accustomed him
 to compare objects with their images, and in these compa
  risons he has only been constrained to use the united powers
 of judgment and of memory. C. Ytard thought this a fa
 vourable moment to teach him our written characters, and
  he made use of the method employed in the instruction of
  the deaf and dumb : he wrote the name of the object on the
  image, and then, by effacing the image, he hoped that the
  name would remain connected with the remembrance of the
  object: but this method proved unsuccessful.        Then other
  means were used, which are detailed in C. Ytard's publica
  tion, the effect of which was as happy as could be hoped.
  The boy now distinguishes the characters of the alphabet, and
   places them in their order; he pronounces the words lait,
 Joupe (not soup), in the common tone, and then brings the
   proper letters, and forms these words.    In this manner, he
   every day acquires a new word; he already begins to emerge
   from his ignorance; he has entered on the territory of reason;
   he is in possession of some of our terms of speech, and will
   soon be enabled to give us some information respecting his
   early condition ; a subject which, of all others, must be most
   interesting to curiosity,                            '.

    It must be observed, that he finds great difficulty in the
 formation of articulate sounds; from the effect of long disuse
 of his organs of speech, there are only a few words that he
 can pronounce perfectly ; but it is hoped that the fame per
 severance which conquered the first difficulties that stood in
 his way, will also help him over the others.
                        LUNAR RAINBOW.
    About seven o'clock on Saturday night, the 24th October,
 a beautiful lunar iris appeared at Edinburgh in the western
 part of the horizon. As the moon was then very near the
 Full, and her altitude above the horizon not very great, the
 red,  yellow, and violet colours of the iris could be easily
 distinguished, and the bow approached pretty near to a com
plete semicircle. This phænoTnenon continued half an hour;
 and, as the western part of the horizon was during that time
 covered with an obscure haze, which rendered it excellently
 adapted for the reception of the colours, it presented a most
beautiful spectacle to many who had never, till then, the
pleasure or observing it.       Aristotle informs us, that he wa3
the first who observed the lunar iris ; and adds, that they are
never seen but at the time of full moon.            It has often ap
peared a matter of wonder to philosophers, how this phæno-
menon so rarely occurs : but if we consider, that it never ap
pears unless the moon be near the opposition
                                                    — that stie comes
into this situation only thirteen times a year; whereas the
fun is in a state fitted for their production twice every day;
and that the light of the moon is incomparably more faint
than that of the fun ; our surprise will quickly vanish, and
we shall rather be astonislied at the frequency of their pro
duction.
    Dr. Garnett, having fitted up an elegant and commodious
lecture-room in Great Marlborough-street,            intends, we un
derstand,   to begin    his lectures   011  natural    philosophy and
chemistry immediately.        The    introductory     lecture  will be
delivered on the 2d of November,           at eight o'clock in the
evening.     The lectures on experimental philosophy will be
delivered every Mondav and Friday, at the same hour; and
those on chemistry every Tuesday and Thursday, at one
o'clock P. M.     The medical lectures will not commence till
January    1802.

 and P ; so will the weight cO laid upon the joint D, and
 the force OD, balance the force cD in the directidn CD \
 and the weight dP laid upon the joint E, and the force PE
 balance the force dE acting in the direction DE. The force
 PE will, by its reaction, be exerted upon the point F.
     Make BA — aB, and draw Am parallel to BC ; Bw will
 therefore = aM, and Am = BM ; and consequently               the
 lines AB, Bm, wA, will represent the forces and their direc
 tions of action which keep the joint B in equilibrium. Draw
 An parallel to DC, then because bC = MB = wA, and bN
 is parallel to mn (included in Bp), the triangle Amn is equal
 and similar to the triangle C£N, and consequently the lines
 Aw, mn, nA, represent the forces and their directions of
 action which keep the joint .C in equilibrium.      So, Ao and
 Ap, being respectively drawn parallel to DE and EF, the
 triangle Ano — DcO, and Aop = ErfP; and consequently
their (ides represent the forces which keep the joints D and E
 respectively in equilibrium.
    2. It is obvious that the weight pressing on any joint is as
the difference of the tangents of the angles which are formed
by each of the legs of that joint with the horizontal line : for
the weight on the joint D is as cO — no; but Bn is the tan
gent of the angle «AB (to the radius AB) = the angle which
the leg DC of the joint forms with the horizontal line AB ;
an 1 Bo is the tangent of the angle oAB (to the fame radius)
 = the angle which the other leg DE of the joint forms with
the horizontal line AB; consequently, no is the difference of
these tangents.
    3. It is equally obvious that the force exerted through any
leg of any of the joints, and which may be called the com
pressing force, i9 as the secant of the angle which that leg
forms with the horizontal line : for the force through the
leg FE is as />A, the force through ED is as oA, through
DC as nA, through CB as mA, and through BA as BA ;
respectively   the secants of the angles, with the radius AB,
which each leg makes with the horizontal.
    4. The horizontal force, or compressing force at the crown,
(which is constant,) is AB
                              = radius; because the leg at the
crown is horizontal, and therefore the angle is nothing there,
the secant of which is equal to radius.
    5. If the weights which are disposed upon any number of

 leg in a system of angles was as the secant of the angle which
 that leg formed with the horizontal line.                        The leg at any
 point of a curve will coincide with the tangent at the same
 point, and therefore the compressing force at any point of the
 arch of a circle is as the secant of the arch between that
 point and the vertex (8.)            Thus the compressing force at 300
 from the crown, is as the secant of 30°; and this is the force
 exerted upon the abutment in direction of the tangent to the
 arch there. The compressing force at 2° from the crown is
 as the secant of a1, and at the crown (10.) as the secant of
 O degrees.

the theory of the equilibrium of arches of a circle, so far as
it relates to practice: the builder will naturally desire to con

stability, and will probably first determine the dimensions and

    23.   It   is well known to mechanicians that                         if   a    heavy body
be sustained by two forces, their directions must meet either
at the centre of gravity of that body, or in a vertical line
which passes through it. Let A, fig. 7, be the body, g its
centre of gravity ; ea a string by which it is suspended, which
again is sustained by the strings ab, ac.         ae is of necessity
vertical, and, if continued, must pass through the centre of
gravity g of the body.       If this string were either longer or
shorter, the point a would still be at rest, and the strings a1'
and ac under the fame tension.       If the body were removed
vertically to the situation dotted, it would be sustained in the
fame position by the strings bf and cg, which would suffer
the same tension as when they were united in the point a.
If instead of strings, props hi,           hi,
                                      applied       the fame direc
                                                                 in
tions on opposite sides of the body, were substituted          or                      ;    if,
instead of these props, others parallel to them were applied,
which,    ifcontinued, would meet in the vertical line, (as mn
and op, which meet in g, do,) the body would still be sup
ported at rest and in the fame position, and the props would
suffer the same force of compression         these latter cases, as
                                                      in
the strings on the opposite fides suffered tension in the former.
   24. Hence the centre of
                                      gravity of the weights
upon the joints E,D, C, (fig. 1.) must be in            verticalline       a
pasting through G, because they arc sustained in equilibrium,
or at rest,    two forces in the diiection BC and FE, which
                   by
lines, continued, meet       G. Also, the centre of gravity of all
                                  in
the weights, fay on B, C, D, and                 E,
                                         must be in     vertical line          a

in the direction FE and ZB, which, continued, meet in                                      h.
   25. Hence also the centre of gravity of the materials upon
a  curve in equilibrium will be in         vertical line that passes
                                                  a
through the point of intersection of the tangents to the ex
treme points of the curve.
                                                                                           Let

let ad be a tangent to the curve at a, ed a tangent to the

The centre of gravity of the whole materials is in a vertical
line which passes through d; and the centre of gra\ iiy ot the
materials over the arch a,b, is in a vertical line that passes
through the point e\ because the points d and e are respec
tively the points of intersection of the tangents, drawn from
the extreme points of the portions in question of the curve.

                       and Experiments upon Dr. James's
  Powder, with     a Method of preparing, in the humid Way,
  a similar Substance.      By   Richard Chenevix,           Esq.
   F.R.S. M.R.I.J.*
jjLFTER       the observations and experiments made by Doctor
 Pearson, to investigate the nature of Doctor James's powder,
 and presented by him to this society, very little remained to
be effected or desired towards a further knowledge of the sub
ject. But those very experiment served to suggest, that the
 mode of preparation was far from being the best that the pre
sent improved state of chemical knowledge might afford ; and
 that, in alt probability, a less defective composition might
 result from a process more conformable to some improve
 ments, which of late have been advantageously applied to
 pharmaceutic chemistry.
    It may be laid down as a general principle, that, in deli
cate experiments, whether analytical or synthetical, sire (that
potent and once believed to be universal agent) is too preca
 rious in its means, and too uncertain in its application, to be
 employed with* full and constant success.      And, if it is still
 recurred to, the advantage of promptness, and a remnant of
 antient custom, are the principal reasons.   But, where other
methods can be devised to effect the same combinations, (and
the humid way offers many,) every person conversant in che
mical knowledge will allow the benefit of adopting them.
The recent improvement in the mode of preparing calomel,
is a striking example of such salutary corrections being suc
cessfully introduced.
    A few observations upon the formula according to which
Dr. James's powder, or the pulvis anlimonialis, is prepared,
and upon some properties of antimony,will place this assertion
in a more prominent point of view.
    In order to prepare this powder, we are told to take equal
weights of bone or hartshorn sliavings aud crude antimony,
and calcine them together, at a high temperature : in other
words, to take phosphate of lime, which already contains a
great excess of lime, and add to it an oxide of antimony.      In
this process, it has been supposed, that the phosphoric acid
of the bone or harlshor.i will saturate, not only the lime with
which it was originally combined, but, in addition to         it,a
new portion of metallic oxide, and      a new portion of lime.
For, what little sulphuric acid might, during the process,
           • From the
                      Philosophical TransaQions for 1S01.
                                                             have

  to error. That portion of oxide of antimony which is not
  volatilized, becomes, in a great measure, insoluble in all the,
  acids. What the effect of the gastric juice may be upon a
  substance which resists the action even of nitro-muriatie acid,
  it is not my purpose to determine. It is sufficient for me to
  say, that, as the quantity of insoluble matter in a given quan
  tity of Dr. James's powder, prepared at different times, may
  vary, the effect of any dose also may differ according to the
  proportions of soluble and insoluble matter.
      I look upon it as a fortunate circumstance, that those ex
  periments and observations which I mentioned in the begin
  ning of this paper, existed as a standard to which I might
  refer my own attempts, and by which I might estimate theif
  validity.     Dr. Pearson has proved, (as by my own experi
  ments I have found,) that in Dr. James's powder about
, 28 per cent, resisted the action of everv acid.              In examining
  some os the pulvis anlimonialis of the London pharmaco
  pœia, I found the average quantity of insoluble matter to be
  about 44 per cent.         This proportion, however, was liable to-
  considerable variation*.
      The powder here treated of is denominated by Dr. Pearson
   a triple salt, or a real ternary combination of a double basi»
   (lime and antimony,) with phosphoric acid.                   What I have
  mentioned with regard to the quantity of acid contained in
  bone or hartshorn, as being too small to saturate a new por
  tion of these bases, may throw some doubts upon the possi
  bility of any such combination in the present case. But I
   have made some more direct experiments, which tend to
   prove that no such combination does exist.
      I  took some white oxide of antimony, (formerly called
      • I find, from the information of several medical gentlemen, that the
  falvis anlimonialis is generally considered as stronger than Dr* James'*
  powder. This seems raiher extraordinary, when we consider that the
  quantity of insoluble matter is erciter in the former than in the latter ;
  aod would almost lead us t<*siil^ect it to be the active part of the medicine,
                                                                      algarotfr

HO                    Observations        and Experiments
el'garoth powder,) precipitated    by water from muriate of art*
timony,     and heated it for a long time with phosphoric acidj
I   decanted the liquor, and washed the powder that remained.
No antimony could          be found                 nor could anv
                                            in the liquor,
traces of phosphoric          be detected in the residuary oxide of
                           ^cid
antimony.      I then took a solution of muriate of antimony,
and divided it into two equal parts: into one I poured di
stilled water; and into the Other, a solution of phosphate of
soda.    In each liquor, a copious precipitate was formed;
which precipitates, after being well washed, were dried. The
weight of both was the fame ; whereas it is evident that,
had any phosphoric acid been combined with the oxide, there
would have been an augmentation of weight in that which
was precipitated by the solution of phosphate of soda. This
precipitate likewise, upon examination, gave no traces of
phosphoric acid. From these experiments it appears that there
exists no combination which can be denominated a phosphate
of antimony.
    To attempt an explanation of the real nature of the powder
here spoken of, I had recourse to some experiments of
M. Berthollet. By detonating sulphuret of antimony and
nitrate of potash in a crucible, lie obtained a mass, which he
reduced to powder, and washed.          The liquor gave, upon eva
poration, a crystallized salt,    which    M. Berthollet terms an
antimoniate ofpotajb.       I never  could succeed in any attempt
to form a similar combination between the above white oxide
of antimony and potash, owing, I believe, to the small quan
tity of oxygen contained therein, compared with that which
is combined with the oxide obtained by detonation.           I can-
hot therefore fav,   that the  powder in question        in any deis,
gree, what M.     Berthollet  would   call an antimoniate    lime.      of
    But be the state, whether of mixture or of        combination,

asserted,        by

tion gradually into distilled water, previously alkalizated by a
sufficient quantity of ammonia. A white, and abundant pre
cipitate will take place, which, well washed and dried, is the
substitute I propose for Dr. James's powder.
    The theory of this precipitation is so clear and simple that
it does not require any comment.                   It may be useful, how
ever, to those who wish to make this preparation, to remark,
that it is absolutely necessary that the solution of phosphate
of lime and of oxide of antimony, in muriatic acid, should,
after being well mixed, be poured into the alkaline liquor,
in order to obtain a precipitate homogeneous throughout the
operation. For, should the alkaline liquor be poured into the
acid solution, the water of the former would act upon the
entire mass of oxide of antimony, while the alkali would pre
cipitate the phosphate of lime only as it saturated the acid
which held that salt in solution : thus the precipitate would
contain more antimony in the beginning; and, towards the"
end, the phosphate of lime would De predominant.                       For the
same reason, too, a pure alkali is preferable              to its  carbonate ;
 for the carbonic acid disengaged would retain in solution a
 portion of phosphate of lime.
     Whether this composition be a chemical combination or
 a mixture, I will not take upon me to determine ; but, for
 the reasons above mentioned, in speaking of Dr. James's
 powder, I belive it to be merely a very intimate mixture. At
 all events, it must be more homogeneous than any that can
 be prepared in the dry way.                 It is entirely soluble in every
 acid that can dissolve either phosphate of lime or oxide of
 antimony separately; and, to have it constantly and uniformly
 the same, no further address in preparing it is required, than
 to avoid the errors I have mentioned.
     As, after some medical trials of the powder, it was sug
 gested to me, that it might be advantageous                      to render it
 somewhat stronger, I prepared             another   portion, by taking two
 parts of oxide of antimony           and   but  one  of phosphate of lime,
 and precipitating as above            described.     The   medicinal power
 was then considerably increased.
     Dr. James's powder is a medicine which has been so long
 in use, and is so deservedly ranked among the most valuable
 we possess, that every attempt to render the process for prepar
 ing it more simple and more certain, mist be allowed to be of
 duced to state fully these particulars, because, fro-n the beneficial effects
 of this salt in the treatment of rachitis, as proposed by M. Bonhomme,
 ( AnituUs lie Cbirnie, vol.xviii. p. i ij,) it may become of general ule. The

 by arguing upon its chemical properties, that I had really
succeeded m improving its medicinal virtues, it still remained
to be proved, by actual experiments that the hoped-for success
was not merely conjectural.      To ascertain this, I gave some
of my powder to Dr. Crichlon, Dr. Babington, and Mr.
Abernethy; gentlemen whose extensive practice and acknow
ledged skill sufficiently enabled them to judge of its medical
properties. They all concur in opinion, that, in its general
effects, it agrees with Dr. James's powder and the pulvis an*
timonialis ; but that it is more mild, and consequently may
be given in larger quantities, seldom producing nausea or
vomiting in doses of less than eight or ten grains.

IN     a paper which I had the honour to present to the Royal
Society or London, and the subject of which was the analysis
of some arseniates of copper and of iron, I had occasion,
in examining many pyrites, matrices of those ores, to remark
the very great inequality which prevailed in the results of re
peated experiments, made with a view to determine the pro
portion of sulphur. But I soon perceived that the inaccuracy
was caused by a partial combustion and acidification of the
radical, through the means of the nitric acid employed to
dissolve the ore.
   Having therefore, in the usual manner, ascertained what
quantity of that ingredient remained untouched, I was forced
to seek the rest of it in the liquor which had washed the va
rious precipitates. To obtain              it,
                                        poured  I solution of ni

trate of barvtes into those washings when all the other sub
stances had been carefully separated, and was thereby enabled
to precipitate, in      state of purity, the sulphate of barytes,

next, to the proportions of the latter, announced in the sy
noptic tables of Fourcroy, as entering into the composition
of sulphate of barytesv According to the former of those
chemists, 100 parts of sulphuric acid contain 71 of sulphur
arid 29 of oxygen; and again, in adopting the propor
tions of the latter, we have 33 per cent, of acid in sulphate
of barytes. But if 100 contain 71 of sulphur, 33 must con
tain 2343.       Consequently, for everv 100 parts of sulphate
ofbarytes, I was to allow 23.43 of sulphur. But, by the
results of my analyses, I had such quantities of sulphate of
barytes as induced me to doubt the accuracy of one or other
of the statements by which I estimated the quantity of real
sulphur contained in the ore.
     No person is better acquainted than our celebrated presi
dent with the many difficulties that occur in the analysis of
salts in general, particularly with regard to the quantity of
real acid they may contain.          It has been a work of trouble
to the ablest chemists, and they have not always agreed in
their results.    The proportions announced by Fourcroy may
therefore be doubted, in common with those of the other
learned operators to whom I have alluded.
     The real quantity of acid produced by the combustion of
any acidifiable basis, can be determined by one or other of
the following methods only : by direct combination in some
salt, the proportions of which are already known 5 or by ob
 taining, in a state perfectly free from water, the acid result
ing from such combustion. To the former method, the ge
 neral objections against all analyses of salts must apply. The
 latter is still more defective.    It is by no means certain that
we have ever yet obtained any acid in a state of perfect fic-
city, unless we except the phosphoric and the arsenic j for
even the crystallized vegetable acids retain a portion of water
 in their crystallization.     It is not that I absolutely deny our
 having   obtained  them   so ;  but I say merely that we have no
 proof.    It would indeed be setting narrow bounds to the per
 fection of nature to assert, that no combustible body could,
 when saturated with oxygen, assume of itself the state of li-
            or that the oxilie of the particular substance called
2uidity;
  ydrogen must be present to confer that property. Doubtless
 sulphuric acid may, as well as water, contain in itself so just
 a proportion of specific heat, as to remain liquid at the tem
 perature of our globe, and under the pressure of our atmo
 sphere.    But both water and sulphuric acid being easily vola
 tilized, and having a powerful affinity for each other, it is
 not easy, if even possible, by distillation, to separate them
 with sufficient accuracy in experiments of delicate inquiry.

A   second source of error, therefore, remained open in thi»
branch of the calculation, which gave the proportion of
aj-43 of sulphur, as that contained in ioo parts of sulphate
of barytes.
    However, before             I
                            would allow myself to call in question
such authorities as those I have quoted, I instituted the fol
lowing experiments: — In a tubulated glass retort I put ioo
parts of purified sulphur, and poured upon them strong nitric
acid. A quilled receiver, plunging into a Woulfe's appa
ratus, was adapted to the retort ; and all being well luted,
I proceeded to distil. The liquor which came over was
poured back several times upon the sulphur, until the whole
was dissolved.        The water which had come over, and that
through     which      the nitrous gas, produced during the opera
tion, had passed, were essayed for sulphureous acid, and no
traces of it could be found.              No sulphur had been vola
tilized, therefore no suspicion could remain that all was not
converted      into sulphuric acid. The liquors which were in
the various parts of the apparatus were united, and to them
was added a sufficient quantity of nitrate of barytes. The
whole was evaporated gently ; because, though I am well
acquainted with the very little solubility of sulphate of ba
rytes, I well know that nitric acid will retain a small portion
of  it, particularly when formed in              liquor where that acid
                                                  a
abounds.        In first experiment obtained 694 from 100 of
                       a                     I
sulphur; in        asecond, 348 from 50; and, in                   third, 347
                                                                   a
from the same quantity.            But the simple rule             ofthree re
duced these quantities to 14.6 or 14.4 per cent, of sulphur
contained in sulphate of baryte&;                  difference wholly to be

                   If,            we  take
neglected.           therefore,              14.5 as the average tor the
quantity   of    sulphur   contained    in  ioo    parts of sulphate of ba
rytes,  we   fliall not  be. far from    the  truth.      From the accord
ance of these experiments, repeated and varied,                       had now
                                                                       I

error, which gave 23.43 as the just proportion.
    To ascertain this point,          operated in the following man

   One hundred parts of this lime were dissolved in dilute
muriatic acid, in the fame platina crucible,           previously
weighed; and then sulphuric acid was added in sufficient
quantity.    Sulphate of lime was precipitated; .and the vessel
was exposed to a heat, at first gentle, to evaporate the liquor ;
and then, by degrees, raised to a temperature       which could
expel every thing  but the  combined   sulphuric acid, and leave
the sulphate of lime completely calcined.     The crucible with
the salt was then weighed, and the augmentation was 76.
It appears to me, that, if we admit' (and I fee no reason that
we should not admit       that calcined lime and calcined sul

    By the former experiments (those made upon sulphur con-
Verted   into acid, and then united to barytes,) we had the
quantity of sulphur contained in sulphate of barytes. By the
latter (those made     directly combining lime with sulphuric
                        by
acid) we had the proportion of real acid contained in cal
cined sulphate of lime.      Consequently,              by
                                                  knowing the ratio
that sulphate of barytes bears to sulphate of lime, with regard
to the acid in each, we shall arrive 'at the knowledge of the
quantity of sulphur contained            real sulphuric acid.
                                          in                      For
this purpose, I   attempted     to dissolve, in water, 100 parts of
sulphate of lime.    But finding in this method of proceeding
a considerable inconvenience arising from the great quantity
of liquor necessary to effect the solution of that salt,          had       I
recourse to the following expedient: — Upon 100 grains of
calcined sulphate os lime,     I  poured some oxalic acid, which
attracts the basis with an affinity superior to that exercised
 by sulphuric acid. Oxalate of lime was here formed but                     ;
oxalate of lime    is soluble in     very small excess of any acid.
                                      a
A little muriatic acid operated            complete solution; and
                                               a
thus  a great quantity   of sulphate   of  lime  required but little
water to dissolve it.     Into this liquor, muriate of barytes
was poured, and suffered to remain some time, gently
heated.    By these means any oxalate of barytes that might
have been .formed, was retained in solution                        by
                                                         the original
                                  H   %                                     excess

 Il6                 On the Quantity   of Sulphur
 excess of acid;    anc! the entire quantity of sulphate osbarytetf
 was deposited.      Of  the exactness of all these methods, which
 I  used as the instruments by which I ascertained these results,
 I   convinced myself by various preliminary experiments.
 After the usual filtration, wastiing and drying at the gentle
 heat of a sand-bath, I obtained in one experiment 185, in
 another 183, and, lastly, in another 180.          This difference
 does not exceed the limits of what all persons conversant in
 analytic chemistry will allow to experiments of this nature.
 We may therefore take 183 as the mean proportion; conse
 quently we sliall say, that 183 of sulphate of barytes contain the
 fame quantity of sulphuric acid as 100 of sulphate of lime; and
 183 : 43 : : 100 : 23.5.       Therefore 23.5 is the proportion of
 acid in 100 of sulphate of barvtes.       But we have before seen
 that 14.5 of sulphur, acidified by nitric acid, form that por
 tion of sulphuric acid contained in 100 of sulphate of barytes,
 viz. 23.5. We must now fay, that 23.5 : 14.5 : : 100 : 61.5,
 and the fourth term will be the proportion of sulphur = 61 .,5,
 which combined with 38.5 of oxygen will form 100 of real
 sulphuric acid.
     In neither of the proportions, whether it be of the acid
 contained in the salt, or of the combustible basis contained
 in the acid, do I agree with the two chemists whom I have
 quoted. This justly excited some doubts in my mind, and led
  me to repeat my experiments. Nor should I yet be tho
  roughly satisfied, if I could not, upon other grounds than
  bv supposing inaccuracy in them, account for the apparent
  differences. We must ever expect to fee the errors of our
  predecessors corrected by men much inferior in abilities, but
  who, by poffesting more certain means, supply the want of
  genius and invention.        At the time in which the experi
  ments were made that determined the proportion of 33 per
  cent, of sulphuric acid in sulphate of barytes, it was not known
  that we had never obtained any barvtes pure ; and that a
  considerable    portion of carbonic acid resitted the action of
  every degree of heat that had been applied to carbonate of
  barytes. The fact was, I believe, first observed by Pelletier,
  but the method of avoiding the inconvenience was pointed
  out by Vauquclin. He decomposes nitrate of barytes by fire,
   and a moderate degree of heat is sufficient to expel all the acid
   and the water.     The chemists I have mentioned performed
   synthetic experiments by combining, directly or indirectly,
   sulphuric acid, and such barytes as they imagined to be pure.
   The constant similarity of their results is sufficient to prove
   the accuracy of their operations; but, working upon an im-
¦
   pure substance, they must have been contented with a simi
   larity of error.

      Three causes may exist which are capable of accounting
   for any variation, whether in plus or in minus, that might
  have appeared in the experiments, by which Lavoisier deter
  mined the quantity of sulphuric acid obtained by the com
  bustion of sulphur in oxygen gas.
      1st, A part of the sulphur may be volatilized during com
 bustion.
     2d, All the sulphur may not be converted into sulphuric
 acid, but part may remain in the state ot sulphureous acid.
     3d, In rectifying, some acid may come over along with
 the water; or, vice versa, some water remain with the acid.
 These considerations will excuse me for having proposed a
 doubt, where the authority of so great a man exists against
  the experiments which I have related.
     The method which I had used to ascertain the quantity
 of sulphur in an ore had been practised by Taflaert (Annales
 de Cbimie, No. 8a: Analysis of Cobalt from Tunaberg); but
 he calculated according to the proportions of Lavoisier and of
 Fourcroy.       In another paper by Thenard, {Annales de Cbi
 mie, No. 96,) he states the proportions of sulphuric acid, ob
 tained by treating sulphur with nitric acid, to be
                    Sulphur       -       -    55.56
                    Oxygen        -       -    44.44
                                              100.00
 but in the extract given by Guyton in that number of the
 Annales de Cbimie, the mode of operation is not described.
 Calcined sulphate of barytes is estimated in the fame paper
 to contain
                   Barytes        -       -    74.83
                   Sulphuric acid         -    25.18
                                              100.00
which proportions are as near to what I had found as can be
expected ; for sulphate of barytes does not contain more than
3 per
          cent, of water of crystallization, and they must be de
ducted from the quintal.
     Having determined with accuracy the proportion of acid
in any insoluble sulphate, it is easy to proceed to the deter
mination of that contained in any other sulphate.        The do-
cimastic art, or analytic chemistry, in general, cannot how
ever expect to derive such advantages from the knowledge of
soluble salts, as of those which, from their insolubility,
may be used with accuracy, in delicate experiments, to de
termine the proportions of the constituent parts of bodies.

But      if  with this mode of operating we compare the quan
 tities of real acid, said (in those excellent tables with which
 Mr. Kirwan has enriched the science) to be contained in sul
 phuric acid of different specific gravities, each will serve as a
 proof of the validity of the other ; and perhaps demonstrate,
 that sulphuric acid, without the intervention of water, may
 enjoy liquidity at the temperature and pressure which act
 upon our globe.

  deposited
                 small yellow, red, and sand-like grains which are
                 at  the bottom of the united solutions, and which
  sometimes assume the octaedral form, are generally taken for
  muriate of platina. The quantity of these crystals, which is
  always very small, does not increase by concentration; which,
  however, ought to be the case, jf these crystals were really
  muriate of platina.        No more of them appear in solutions
   from which they have been once separated ; and their sepa
   ration is even complete a long time before the moment when
   the real muriate of platina begins to crystallize.
       These crystals are a double salt, composed of muriate of
   platina and potash, as will be seen hereafter : they are formed
   from the small quantity of potasli which, by the inadvertency
   of the workmen, remains in the neck of the retorts, when
   preparing nitric acid, and from that also which is carried
   over in the distillation itself; for nitre is always found, after
    the rectification of aquafortis, at the bottom of the retorts.
    The greater part of those who have operated on platina
    having in general employed the acids fold in the (hops, we
    need not be surprised that they should have found crystalline
    deposits of the kind here alluded to, and that none of them are
    ever seen in solutions made on purpose with acids well purified.
        If some of these crystals be heated in a glass tube closed at
     one end, their nature mav be soon distinguished ; because the
    muriatic acid, charged with the oxygen of the metal, is vo
     latilized in gas; while the platina, reduced to the metallic
     state, and mixed with the muriate of potash, remains at the
     bottom of the tube.
        Lewis, in my opinion, is the only person who has accu
     rately observed the crystallization of platina.      The solution
                                                                  wag

"was accidentally at that degree of saturation which could
 conduct to thi* discovery; and this circumstance, as will be
 seen, is the first of those necessary for the success of the crys
tallization in question.
   The second condition consists in not leaving ah excess of
acid ; and this Lewis accomplished ; for he says (p. 148)
that the favour of these crystals was harsh and disagreeable,
but much less corrosive than he expected, on account of the
great quantity of acid which he had employed.       Indeed, if
this solution be prepared in the same manner as prepared by
Lewis, it will be found to have the savour of sour vegetables;
and whatever disagreeable taste it has, arises from the iron
and copper.
   The muriate of platina, when pure, easily crystallizes;
but it is difficult to make it crystallize when it is united
with foreign muriates not susceptible of crystallization, and
which oppose this tendency.              In this there is nothing
which distinguishes it from the most crystallizable salts, ana
therefore we must endeavour to discover means for disen
gaging it from these obstacles.            We tliall now examine
those which may remove the excess of acid from a solution
of platina.
   Every solution which has been subjected to ebullition and
concentration is not charged w^th muriatic acid, and the
cause may be easily perceived : but the case is not the fame
with the nitric acid, which suffers itself to be concentrated ;
and though it is not attracted by the oxides, which the mu
riatic acid seizes upon exclusively,         it adheres to them with
sufficient force ; but if it be difficult to expel
                                                 it,
                                                 it     may be easily
 decomposed.
    To accomplish this, little muriatic acid and crude platina
                          a
must   be added to the solution before      be distilled.
                                            it             This
acid, which cannot act upon the platina until          has been
                                                         it
oxidated, at the expense of the nitric acid, determines the
decomposition of the latter, and facilitates the separation in
the form of nitrous gas.      This operation mav be repeated,
 and when no more gas appears you may be assured that you
 have  asolution disengaged from every excess of acid. When
 the solution  is brought to this term, nothing but muriates
 different from that of platina can retard the crystallization
 these muriates are thole of copper and iron oxydated to             a :
 maximum.
    To separate them,   it   is
                           indispensably    necessary to concen
 trate the solution in such      manner, that
                                  a                itmay form in
 cooling   amass, which moulds   itself in the retort,  but of such
a  consilience, that, when placed on its side,      it Hull suffer   a

 portion of the liquor to escape.        If the concentration haa
  not come to that point, and if the residuum presents only a
  thick substance like honey, it must be again placed over the
  fire. But if it has been carried too far ; that is to fay, if the
  separation of the liquid part cannot be effected, you must
  then add to the mass, which we here suppose to be four or
  five pounds, some spoonfuls of water, and rediffolve it by the
  help of heat and ebullition.      This method, which is very
  easy   for those acquainted with the  practice of the laboratory,
  is the fame as that employed for refining sugar, and sepa->
 rating from it the molasses.
      After having surmounted this obstacle, the rest becomes
  easy.     Nothing then is necessary but to add a quantity of
  water nearly equal to the volume of the muriates that have
  thus been separated ; to expose the whole to heat ; to suffer
  the retort to cool in the furnace ; and to proceed to two or
  three successive distillations, to separate the crystals of the
 muriate of platina.
     This method has a double object—the crystallization of
 the muriate, and its purification.      It is evident, and cannot
 be doubted, that, by repeating this process a sufficient
  number of times, platina may be as completely purified
 as by any of the other means hitherto known.              But while
 we admit all the utility of this    method,    we  must   allow  that
 it is tedious and troublesome,     both   in regard  to the  crystal
 lization of the muriate, and its purification.          The others
 therefore, in our opinion, ought to be preferred 5 for, to
 obtain the crystals with the greatest ease, it will be sufficient
 to concentrate a solution of platina purified by a process
w.hich we fliall speak of hereafter.         If any one, however,
wlshes to carry this method of purification to the highest
 degree, he may be certain of having attained to it by making
 the following experiment :
     Dissolve, in a certain quantity of water, a little of this mu
 riate, and try it with ammonia.       If the common yellow pre
 cipitate of the red oxide of iron be obtained, there still re
mains some muriate of the latter combined with the platina ;
 but the muriate of platina is pure if no precipitate manifests
 itself.
     It is of importance that the solution should be well di
luted , otherwise the ammonia would form with the platina
 that kind of saline precipitate which is produced by the mu
riate of ammonia.
     At the moment of their concentration these solutions of
platina experience a bubbling which would endanger the
retort if the person who conducts the operation persisted in
                                                         continuing

continuing the sire. These movements arise from the union
of a yellow powder, which as yet is only the potasliecl mu
riate of platina of which we have just spoken, aud which it
is indispensably necessary to separate.     In regard to the most
expeditious   means  of  heating  a  retort  which contains 12 or
 jij pounds  of matter,  and of maintaining the heat, a support
or wire ought to be preferred to sand-baths, which I have long
banished from my laboratory, even in the preparation of
aether, the rectification of acids, &c.
    But when it is necessary to operate on a great scale with a
certain number of vessels, it is evident that land-baths placed
in a row in a gallery will in this cafe be attended with more
certainty.
XIV. Of the     Composition  of the Nitro-muriatic Acid for    the
                    Solution of crude Platina,
    No author has said any tiling positive in regard to the pro
portions which will yield the strongest nitro-muriatic acid
for this kind of labour. This uncertainty, which stopped me
during my first researches, induced me to endeavour to dis
cover these proportions by direct experiments.
    As the strength of acids varies in the different manufac
tories, it appeared to me proper to take them at that degree
of concentration at which they are commonly found in the
shops.    I confined myself therefore to aquafortis of 35 de
grees by Baumi's areometer,        and muriatic acid of 15 de
grees, without giving myself any trouble about the nitric acid
which might be present in the muriatic acid, or the iron and
the sulphuric and sulphurous acids with which common mu
riatic acid is often contaminated : for, if I had employed in
my researches rectified acids, it is evident that my results
could not be applied but with restriction to operations on
platina on a large scale, in which case it will always be ne
cessary to employ the acids of commerce.
   Exper. I. One pound of nitro-muriatic acid, composed of
                   8 ounces of nitric acid and
                   8 ounces of muriatic acid,
dissolved 13 drams of platina out of 24 which I employed.
   Exper. II. Nitro-muriatic acid, composed of
                   8 ounces of nitric acid and
                  10 ounces of muriatic acid,
dissolved 1 < drams of platina.
   Exper. III. An acid, composed of
                   4 ounces of nitric acid and
                  10 ounces of muriatic acid,
dissolved 17 drams and 54 grains of platina.

                      14 ounces of muriatic acid,
dissolved 13 drams and 38 grains of platina.
    These four experiments were made at the fame                   decree of
heat    ; that is to fay, in four retorts, disposed according to
niy mode on wire grates, and placed on a furnace.- That the
results may be more easily compared, I (hall here give them
in the following table :

     IV.    6 ounces     2 ounces 14 ounces       13 drams 38 grains
    Let us now fee the consequences which may be deduced
from this table.
     1st, In the three first experiments it is observed that the
             of platina dissolved increases in proportion to that of
Suantity
   le muriatic acid, from which it results that this acid is the
real solvent of platina.
     2d, Is we suppose that the twelve ounces of muriatic acid,
found in the four ounces of nitric acid the quantity of oxy
gen necessary for dissolving the platina, it is seen that a con
siderable excess of the latter was uselessly expended in the
two preceding experiments ; that is to fay, 4 ounces too.
much in the first, and 2 in the second ; and, by the same
 reason, the solutions of the first and second experiments were
 more acid than those of the third and fourth.
     3d, Acids, the strength of which is in a similar proportion,
 or nearly three parts of muriatic acid for one of nitric acid,
 must form the properest proportion for dissolving crude pla
 tina, and consequently purified platina.
     4th, The fourth experiment proves to us that the nitric
 acid, which was in the proportion of only i-7th of the mu
 riatic acid, was not able to furnish to the latter the quantity
 of oxygen neecssiry to make it charge itself with all the pla
 tina which it bught to dissolve; hence it results, that in this,
 last proportion there is a less solution of platina, and a loss,
 of muriatic acid,
                                                                     5th, As.

    The five consequences which we have here deduced, and
which are nothing but the result of the same experiments,
give us the true principles of the art of dissolving platina.
    If we now compare the proportion of platina with the
nitro-muriatic acid, we shall find that the quantity dissolved
rises somewhat above the eighth part of the weight of the
solvent.      This proportion, however, is subject to some varia
tion ; for the same acid employed in similar circumstances
dissolves sometimes a less quantity, though in general it de
viates very little from this proportion.
XV.      On the Utility which may       he derived from the Products
                         ¦
                           of this Diflillation.
    In   operations  on a large scale, œconomy being one of the
most important objects, it may be readily conceived that the
acid products in question ought to be carefully collected, and
that the concentration should be carried as far as possible to
increase these products; for the expense of these solutions will
be so much more moderate, if the fame quantity of acids can
be employed for a greater quantity of platina.         That I might
be better enabled to ascertain the advantages in this respect,
1 made the following experiment :
     I distilled, to the consistence of concrete honey, a solution
similar to that of the third experiment, the product of which
I   carefully collected ; and by these means I was enabled to
observe in this operation three different periods.
     In the_/zr/? the distillation, which began at a heat of nearly
70 degrees (or about 1500 Fahr.), was accompanied with
effervescence and a disengagement of nitrous gas, which, as
Lavoisier observes, deserves to be examined, and especially
the moment when the oxide of azote or azotic oxide manifests
 itself.
     In  the second period, the effervescence was followed by ebul
lition ; and here no nitrous gas was distinguished j a weak co
                                                              lourless

124                  Experiments on Platina.
  lourless acid only is seen to rise, while the solution make* no
 other progress than that of approaching towards concentra
 tion.
     When the heat had made the greater part of the super
  fluous liquids pass over into the receiver, the nitrous gas
 again showed itself ; and it appeared to me at this third pe
 riod, that the portion of the free acids, which had attained to
 a certain degree of concentration, exercised a reaction on the
 crude platina.       But I soon perceived that I could not depend
 on    this   advantage; for, after having diluted in water the
 saline mass, to separate the excess of the crude platina,             I
 found that the pound of nitro-muriatic acid had dissolved
 only 1 6 drams and 12 grains of platina; a quantity which
 diners by more than a dram from that of the third experi
 ment : but notwithstanding this variation, it is not, as I nave
 said, an eighth above the other.
     The nitrous gas of this third period gives us reason to
 believe that it does not differ in its origin from that observed
in the concentration of metallic nitrates, when the latter ap
 proach condensation. The augmentation of heat, therefore,
only decomposes a remainder of the nitric acid, from which
the red vapours in question result.
     Let us now return to the distillation. The liquor found in
the receiver weighed 10 ounces and i dram : it had no co
 lour, and by the areometer indicated only 9 degrees ; while
the nitro-muriatic acid, which had produced           it,
                                                        indicated 22
before it     was employed. The liquor       sometimes seen (lightly
                                             is
coloured, though the operation may have been conducted
with the usual precautions; because the movement of the
ebullition  is    no doubt sufficient to throw    a few drops of the
solution into the neck of the retort. This, on the whole,             is
only  a   little platina, asis   indicated at the moment         by
                                                                  the
cinnamon-coloured         precipitate, occasioned     by the hydro-
sulphurated      water. These acid products have no sensible
action on the platina   ;    but, to know the advantage which
ought to be taken of them,           I divided them into two parts,
of five ounces and half dram each,
                            a
 I     added to one of these parts       2 ounces of muriatic acid,
to the other an equal quantity of nitric acid; and these two
new mixtures were treated, as usual, with three ounces of the
fame crude platina.
    The first dissolved
                      4    drams and 16 grains of platina, which
would have approached           8! drams     if
                                              I  had employed the
10 ounces and    1     dram of the product with the addition of
4   ounces of muriatic acid.
    The second could dissolve only 48 grains, that          isto fay,
                                                             1  dram

l dram and 24 grains, had I employed the fame product
with the addition of 4 ounces of nitric acid. Let us now
examine the consequences which may be deduced from these
results.
     Ifwe suppose that the first mixture could dissolve 8 drams
and a half of platina, the muriatic acid added must have found
a sufficient quantity of nitric acid to oxygenate  but ounces                 it;        4

least, of the fame acid.       Since 12 ounces of muriatic acid
were indeed employed in the third experiment to dissolve
 17 drams of platina,           evident that to dissolve the half of
                                      it   is

 crude platina.

 of nitric acid to oxygenate the 2 ounces of muriatic acid
which we found in it : but the great quantity of water in
 which they are diluted destroys all their action; and if the
addition of 4 ounces of nitric acid restores to them some
 strength, it is only, in all probability, because that quantity
 of acid augments, to a certain degree, the concentration of
 the muriatic acid.
     From    these data let us try to determine what is the largest
 quantity of platina that can           be dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid
 prepared     according      to  the  proportions   above indicated.
     To dissolve first the 17 drams and 54 grains, and then the
  8 drams and 32 grains, making together 26 drams and 14
 grains, we employed ia ounces of muriatic acid and 4 of
 nitric acid, ana afterwards 4 ounces of the former, that is to
 fay, 20 ounces of mixture in the whole.                  Calculation shows,
 neglecting the 14 grains of platina, more or less, that only •
5 pounds 11 ounces* of nitro-muriatic acid are requisite to
 dissolve a pound of black crude platina, which is that I em
ployed in these experiments. If we consult thecheniists, we
 {hall find that the greater part of them have fixed at 16 parts
 the quantity of nitro-muriatic acid which must be employed
 to dissolve one of platina.            If I am not mistaken, Lewis and
 count Sickingen were the only persons able to dissolve it with
 8 parts of solvent.         But they were obliged to perform two
operations to dissolve-that quantity.               White crude platina is
the kind most soluble; for I find, in a note, that a pound of
nitro-muriatic acid, composed according to the proportions
indicated, dissolved 18 drams and 24 grains.
XVI.      Solution    of Platina by the Means of a Nitro-muriatic
    Acid   composed     os Nitric Acids at 31° and Marine Salt.
    Bergman found that an acid composed in this manner dis
solved platina exceedingly well.               It will be seen by the fol
 lowing experiments           that,   in  an  operation on a great scale,
 this solvent may be preferred to those composed with pure
acids. To be able to discover the most advantageous pro
portion of acid and salt,           I  made a scries of experiments, but
 I  shall give an account of those only which can throw light
on solutions of this nature. As the method of employing
this kind of nitro-muriatic acid is not different from that

 16 ojnces, or 12S drams      of 71 grains, the proportions remain the fame.

nitric   acid ought to have disengaged and oxygenated the same
quantity of muriatic acid.       I confess that  I  cannot conceive
how an excess of marine fait or nitrate of soda> found in the
mixture, could prevent the solution of a greater quantity of
crude platina, unless the explanation of this phænomenon
be found in an observation I shall here make, or my occu
pations allow me to undertake new researches on this subject.
The observation I allude to is as follows: The residuum
of all the solutions, that is to fay, the remaining crude pla
tina, exhibits an aspect very different from that of the resi-
duums left by nitro- muriatic acid composed of free acids*

    1st, Act d. — An acid exists in all wines} I never found any
which did not present some traces of it. The sweetest and
most luscious wines redden test paper, if suffered to remain in
them for some time ; but they are not all acid in the same
degree.      There are some the principal character of which is
a natural acidity.       Those made from grapes not perfectly
ripe,   or  produced  in  cold climates, are of this fort } while
those produced by the fermentation of very ripe and saccha
rine grapes exhibit very little acid. The acid, then, appears
to be in the inverse ratio of the alcohol, which is the result
of the decomposition of the sugar.
    This acid exists in great abundance in verjuice; and is found
in must, though in a smaller quantity. All fermented liquors,
such as cyder, perry, and beer, as well as fermented farina
ceous substances, also contain this acid : and I have found it
 even in molasses.      Indeed it is to saturate it completely, that
lime, ashes, or other earthy or alkaline bases, are obliged to
 be employed in the purification of sugar.        Without this pre
caution, the existence of the acid would oppose the crystal
 lization of the sugar.
    If wine be concentrated by distillation, the extract which
 results from it in general has a four and pungent taste.        To
 dissolve .and separate the acid, nothing is necessary but to pour
 water or alcohol over the extract. This acid has a pungent

taste, an odour slightly empyreumatic, leaves a sensation of
harshness on the tongue, &c.          When well filtered and left
in a jar, it suffers to be precipitated a considerable quantity
of extractive matter. It then becomes covered with mouldi-
nefs, and in that state seems to approach the acetous acid.
It   may   be purified by di filiation, which separates from it
a large    quantity of extractive matter; and it is then less
liable to be decomposed by putrefaction.
   This acid precipitates the carbonic acid from its combina
tions : it dissolves with facility the greater part of the me
tallic oxides : it forms insoluble salts with lead, silver, and
mercury j and separates the metals from all their solutions in
acids.
   This acid forms also an insoluble salt with lime.     If  abun
dance of lime water be mixed with wine, it precipitates the
acid, which carries with it all the colouring matter. This
acid, then, is of the nature of the malic acid. It is always
mixed with a little of the citric acid ; for, when digested on
oxide of lead, besides the insoluble precipitate which is formed,
there is produced a citrate, which may be sliown in it by the
common means.
   This malic acid disappears by the acetisication of the wine •.
in well made vinegar, nothing exists but acetous acid. This
transformation of the malic acid into acetous acid naturally
explains why wine which has only begun to turn four can
not be employed in manufacturing acetite of lead : in this
cafe there is formed an insoluble precipitate, with the pro
duction of which I was greatly embarrassed till I learned
the reason of it.     For a long time, C. Berard, my associate
in my manufactory of chemical productions, added nitric
acid to four wine to give it the property of forming a soluble
salt with lead.    I was then of opinion that the acid of wine
was by these means oxygenated, while the effect really pro
duced was to hasten the decomposition and conversion ot the
malic acid into vinegar.
   The existence of the malic acid in wine in different propor
tions, serves to throw some light on a phæuomenon of the
highest importance in regard to the distillation of wines, and
the nature of the spirit produced from them.          Every body
knows, not only that all wines do not give the fame quantity
of spirit, but that the spirits produced from them arc far from
being of the fame quality.         No one is ignorant that beer,
cyder, perry, and fermented farinaceous substances, give little
spirit, and always of a bad quality.       Careful and repeated
distillation may, indeed, correct these faults in a certain de
gree, but never destroy them completely.          These constant

 still     retains
          it         a disagreeable odour, which does not belong to
 pure spirit.
      Wines which contain the greatest quantity of malic acid
 give spirits of the worst qualities.               even appears that the

 water, chalk, or fixed alkali, very little alcohol can be ob
 tained        by
               distillation      and in all these cases the spirit assumes
                                 ;
a    disagreeable taste of the fire, which does not contribute to
 improve the quality.
      The difference of the spirits arising from the distillation of
 different kinds of wine depends then, chiefly, on the different
 proportions in which the malic acid                   contained in these

  of their increase, and which does not disappear from wine

   Alcohol, then, is more or       abundant in all wines. Those
                                      less
of warm climates furnish a great deal ; those of cold climates
give scarcely any at all.   Ripe and saccharine grape3 produce
it in abundance; while the wines arising from green aqueous
grapes, which contain little of the saccharine principle, afford
very little.
    There are some wines in the south which furnish a third of
spirit : there are several in the north which contain only a
fifteenth.
    It is the proportion of alcohol that renders wines more or
new wine, he was only able to separate, by means of potash, the fame
quantity of alcohol.     But this experiment appears to me to prove at most
that the foreign alcohol added to the wine does not enter into so exact a
combination as that which exists naturally there : it remains in the state of
simple mixture.      We observe a similar phenomenon when highly concen
trated alcohol is diluted by the addition of a greater or less quantity of
water; for it is known in commerce that this weakened alcohol has not
the fame taste, which marks, however, the fame degree of spiritofity.             I
consider alcohol, then, in wine not as existing there in an insulated state,
and disengaged from all combination, but as combined with the colouring
principle, carbon, alkali, extractive matter, and all the other constituent
principles of wine -. so that wine is a super-compounded whole, all the ele
 ments of which may be extracted by chemical means ; and when, by the
application of heat, these principles are separated, the most volatile rise,
first, and what first passes is a very light compound, forming alcohol, then
water, See.
    Distillation, by successively extracting all the principles of wine, accord
ing to the invariable laws of their gravity and of their affinities, breaks
and destroys the primitive       combination which constitutes wine, and ex
hibits products which, when united again, cannot reproduce the primitive
body, because the h«£t has entirely disunited and separated the compound
 into principles which may exist in an insulated state, and which have
scarcely any affinity.
   In a word, it is of little importance to art whether the alcohol exists or
does not exist in Wine; the distiller still has invariable principles both in
regard to the quality and to the quantity of alcohol which each kind of
wine can furnish.       Whether the heat, therefore, combines the principles
of the alcohol, or merely extracts them from a mass where they are com
bined, the manner of operating and the results of the operation can re
ceive from them no modification.         We fee in the distillation of all vege
table matters, and their products, a repetition of the phenomena exhibited
by the distillation of wine.
   Distillation by heat is not the only means of extracting the alcohol from
 wine.     1st, The carbonic acid gas which is disengaged by fermentation
carries with  it,  and in  a  Rate of solution,  avery considerable quantity of
alcohol, asI      have already mown,        xd, The gas which escapes from
 champagne carries off almost all the alcohol contained in that wine.
 3d, Very soiritous wines, when shaken in the bottle, suffer to escape a
 very sensible flavour of alcohol. 4th, The wines which furnish most spirit
are thought to be most spiritous to the taste.    All these facts cannot be re
conciled with the hypothesis of the formation of alcohol        bydistillation, and
ftem to prove that   it exists quite formed in the wine.
   The reader on this important subject may recur to the opinion of Four,
croy, published in Attnalts dt Chimie.

tess generous ; it is it which disposes them to, or preserves
them from, acid degeneration.       Wine turns four with more
facility the less alcohol it contains, the proportion of extrac
tive matter being supposed to be the same in both.
   The richer wine is in spirit, the less it contains of malic-
acid; and this is the reason why the best wines furnish, in
general, the best spirit, because they are then freed from the
presence of that acid which gives them their disagreeable
taste.
    It is by distilling wines that all the alcohol they contain
is extracted.
    The distillation of wine has been known for several cen
turies; but this operation has been successively improved, and
at present has been brought to such a state or perfection, that
the spirit trade must derive great benefit from       it,
                                                        and that the
process may be applied with advantage to every other kind of
distillation.     The alembics long used for distilling were
boilers with   a     long narrow cylindric neck, having at the
summit   a    hollow hemisphere, from which proceeded        a tube,
of no great size, destined to convey the liquor into the worm.
Arnold de Villanova seems to have been the first who gave
us any accurate notions in regard to the distillation of wines     j
and to him we are indebted for the first description of this
long-necked alembic, models of which are still found among
our perfumers.
    The idea entertained, that the product of the distillation
was the more delicate, subtile, and pure, as            itwas raised
higher,   by   making     itpass through very small tubes, directed
the construction of these stills. But distillers were soon con
vinced that    it   was not    somuch the obstacles opposed to the
ascent of the vapours as the art of graduating the heat in          a
proper manner, which rendered the product of the distillation
more or less pure.        It has been found that, in the first cafe,
the force of the fire changes the nature of the spiritous prin
         by   communicating to them an empyreumatic taste;
ciples
while, in the second, pure spirit arises, and passes into the
worm without alteration.           On the other hand, œconomy,
an important consideration          in the arts, has caused all the
changes made        in the old processes to be adopted.
    Thus the column perpendicular to the boiler has been suc
cessively lowered, the capital enlarged, the. boiler made wider,
and the following general forms have been gradually adopted.
    The stills, at present, are kind of flat-bottomed boilers,
                                    a
 the sides of which rife perpendicularly to the height of about
twenty-two inches. At this height a contraction takes place,
which reduces the aperture to eleven or twelve inches. This
                                                             aperture

aperture is terminated by a neck some inches in length, in
which is adapted a small cover called the bead, which in
creases in diameter towards the upper part so a3 to have the
form of a truncated cone inverted. From the angle of the
base of this capital proceeds a small tube destined to receive
the vapour of the spirit, and to transmit it to the worm with
which it    is connected.      The worm consists of six or seven
circumvolutions, and is placed in a cask kept full of water to
facilitate the condensation of the vapours : these vapours,
when condensed, run down into a tub destined to receive
them.
   The boilers, in general, are fixed in mason-work up to the
part where the contraction takes place : the bottom alone is
exposed to the immediate action of the heat.                The chimney
is placed opposite to the sire-hole j and the ash-hole, which
is not very large, is separated from the fire-place by an iron
grate.
   The boiler is charged with five or six quintals of wine. The
distillation is completed in eight or nine hours, and during
each operation about sixty pounds of coals are consumed.
    Such is the process which has been long used in Langue-
doc ; but though old, and generally adopted, it presents im
perfections, which must strike every man acquainted with,
the principles of distillation.

of liquid, are condensed, and again dissolve in the liquor.
It   is only when the whole mass has been heated gradually
that the distillation   is establistied.
   2d, The contraction at the upper part of the boiler and
the internal bending which         it presents in that place, still hurt
the distillation :   for this part, not being covered              by

quality of the product, which in some cases is altered and
decomposed.      These phænomena may be rendered very sen
sible by cooling the upper part of the retort of the sand-bath
at the moment when the distillation is most active: the va
pours successively become visible in the inside, and drops are
condensed on the fides, which soon run down and join the
liquor contained in the retort.
    Besides, the contraction at the upper part of the boiler
forms a kind of eolipile, where the vapours cannot pass with-
out difficulty, which necessarily requires a more considerably
force of ascension.     This fact has been properly explained by
Baume.
   3d, The capital is not constructed in the most advantageous
manner: the head acquires almost the temperature of the
vapours, which, being strongly dilated, press on the liquid
and confine its ascent.
   4th, The method of managing the sire is no less improper
than the form of the apparatus : the afli-hole is every where
too small, the fire-place too large, the door badly (hut, &c.
so that a current of air is established at the door, and is pre-.
cipitated into the chimney, pasting over the coals. Conse
quently, a violent fire is required to heat the boiler mode
rately.     The grate is choked up with a thick stratum of
combustibles, To that they become nearly useless for want of
a free circulation of the air.

XXI.     Account  of a Disc cut  into the Crater of Mount Vesuvius
    by eight Frenchmen      on the Night between the lbtb and
    iQ/i> of July J 80I.
  J.   O ascend to the summit of mount Vesuvius, which is
elevated 3600 feet above the level of the sea, is an enterprise
of great difficulty, as it is necessary for nearly half the height
to climb an exceedingly steep declivity up to the knees in
ashes.     Some philosophical men of eminence, however, as
Spallanzani, Dolomieu, Dr. Moore, &c. have overcome all
these difficulties.   Sir William Hamilton, who caused a great
many views of Vesuvius to be designed during his long resi
dence at Naples, ascended to the summit of it sixty-two
times; but no one, at least since the eruption in 1779, ever
ventured to descend into the crater of this volcano, not even
Sir William Hamilton, who considered it under so many
points of view, and who visited it so many times.            It was
                                                           reserved

  careous stones, different in their nature and colour according
 to the different degrees of impression which have been made
 on them by the fire.
    The half of the height next the summit is composed chiefly
 of pure allies, but coarser than our common asties. Till the
 present time, there have been twenty-four eruptions recorded
 in history. The first took place in the year 79 after the
 Christian æra : by these eruptions volcanic matters have been
 successively accumulated, but by that of 1779 the situation of
 the crater and of the aperture was entirely changed,       The
 focus or crater is now funk 200 feet below the upper edges
 of the mouth of the volcano.
    To arrive at the crater, and to observe the numerous spi
racles, long crevices, and sires which issue from them in se
veral places, and also the variegated and still smoking matters
of which the crater is composed, it was necessary to pass over
this space of 200 feet.
    The inner sides of the volcano are nearly perpendicular, or
exceedingly steep, and composed of asties, lava, and large cal
careous stones ; but these lava and stones, as they form no
connection with the asties, cannot serve as any point of sup
port; and when any one is so imprudent as to adhere to this
kind of rock, the least motion, the least displacement of any
part, makes the whole crumble to pieces. Besides, from the
summit of Vesuvius to the crater, the declivity, being exceed
ingly rapid, cannot be traversed but on all fours, andsuffering
yourself to glide down amidst a torrent of allies and lava. But
the most dangerous obstacles are those awful excavations,
which cannot be passed over without great trouble and dif
ficulty.

136                  Account   of a   Descent
     Disregarding the terror with which the Neapolitans en
deavoured     to inspire us, after having received their adieus, as
 if our separation had been likely to be eternal, we set out in
 a carriage, at half after eleven at night, on the 18th of July,
from the hotel of the French ambassador, fourteen in num
ber, furnished with ropes and other articles which we sup
posed might be necessary, and all in a state of the highest
spirits, which never forsook us, even at times of the most
imminent danger. We arrived about midnight at the foot
of Vesuvius ; and, having quitted our carriage, mounted well          .
experienced mules, and proceeding one alter the other, with
adjutant Dampicrre at our head, amidst the thick darkness of
night, reached halfway to the steep summit of the mountain.
We had a numerous body of guides, and their lighted torches
gave to our expedition a mysterious and solemn air, which
formed a striking contrast with the mirth and gaiety of the
company.
    When we had ascended about half way, we were obliged
to alight, and to clamber up the steepest and most difficult
part of Vesuvius, wading through the ashes up to the knees,
till, exhausted with fatigue, and covered with sweat, we
reached the summit at half past two in the morning.
    The first thing that struck us, as soon as the morning began
to dawn, was a most magnificent spectacle — a superb view;
of the city and port of Naples, the beautiful hills which sur
round them, and the vast extent of the sea by which they
are washed.      After walking round part of the aperture of the
volcano, that we might choose the most commodious place
for descending,      adjutant Dampierre and C. Wickar first
descended, without any accident, at the determined point.
When they had got about a third of the way they were sud
denly stopped by an excavation of fifty feet, which it wa3
necessary to pass. Aslhev found that it was impoflible to ob
tain any fixed point of suppqrt on ashes so moveable; and
being convinced that the friction of ropes would have soon
destroyed both the point of support and the neighbouring
masses to a great distance, they resolved to return.       Besides,
while deliberating on the means of descending, some stones
rolling down from the summit occasioned a general agitation
wherever they passed : adjutant Dampierre found theground
on which he stood shake beneath his feet; and he had scarcely
        it,  calling out to C. Wickar to follow him, when       it
2uitted
  isappeared.     Soon after, indeed, the whole place where they
had stood, and all the neighbouring small eminences, crum
bled down successively in the course of half an hour, and were
precipitated to the bottom of the crater with an awful noise.
                                                            Before

               into the Crater os  Mount Vesuvius.           137
   Before we renounced our enterprise to return to Naples,
dejected on account of not having succeeded, we once more
walked round the mouth of the crater, and at last discovered
a long declivity, pretty smooth though very steep, which
conducted to the focus. Without examining the precipices
which it might be necessary to pass before it could be reached,
C. Debeer, the ambassador's secretary, accompanied by a laz-
zaroni, set out first to attempt the passage.    When they had
got  half way,   amidst  a torrent of ashes, which the impression  «
of their feet made to roll down along with them, they found
means to fix themselves on the edge of a precipice twelve feet
in height, which it was" necessary to pass before they could
reach the lower declivity.        The lazzaroni, frightened, re
fused to proceed ; but, being promised a double ducat, avarice
got the better of his timidity ; he speedily made the sign of
the cross over his whole body, and, having invoked the Ma
donna, and St. Anthony of Padua, threw himself along with
C. Debeer to the bottom of the first precipice : soon after
they arrived at another, but being of less height it was passed
with more ease. At length, amidst a continual torrent of
falling lava, ashes, and stones, they arrived at the bottom of
the crater, and stretched out their arms to us, sending forth
shouts of joy, which we returned with the utmost satisfaction
and enthusiasm.
    C. Houdouart, engineer, immediately followed C. Debeer;
and after encountering the same difficulties, and passing dan-
         precipices, joined him at the bottom of the crater,
  ieing there both convinced of the almost insurmountable
ferous
difficulty of ascending, they threw themselves into each other's
arms, lilce two friends reduced to the necessity of terminating
their lives together in a desert island without any hopes of
escaping from it.
    They then began, but with cautious steps, to walk
round this immense furnace, which still smokes in several
places.    The intrepid Wickar, who was very desirous to par
ticipate in their fate, called out tp them to fend some one to
assist him in passing the two cliffs ; but seeing no one coming,
 and growing impatient, he rushed forward, and rolled down
 towards them amidst a torrent of stones, ashes, and volcanic
 matters. Adjutant Dampierre, C. Bagneris physician to the
 amiy, Fressinet and Andras French travellers, and Moulin
 inspector of posts, soon followed, and arrived at the crater
 after having incurred the fame dangers.

 then formed a small collection of the different volcanic mat
 ters which appeared to be new or curious, and endeavoured
 to make a few observations.                                           '
     Had we been allowed to depend on success, had we not
 been retarded in our preparations by our timid guides, and
 if some of us, having only just arrived at Naples, had not
 been straitened in point of time, our descent would certainly
 have been much more useful, and the results more satisfac
 tory.     However, though       ill furnished with means, the fol
 lowing are the observations we were enabled to make                   :
     Reaumur's thermometer, the only instrument we possessed,
 stood at 1   2 degrees, on the summit of Vesuvius            :    the air was
"cold, and somewhat moist         :   in the crater the quicksilver rose
 to 16 degrees, and we experienced the mildest temperature.
     The surface of this place, which, when seen                 by the naked
eye, looking down from above, appeared entirely smooth,
 exhibited, when we were at the bottom, nothing but                        avast
 extent of asperities.      We were constantly obliged to pass over
lava exceedingly porous, in general pretty hard, but which
in some places, and particularly those where we entered, was
still soft, and yielded under our feet.               The speclacle which
struck    us  most  was    the  numerous       spiracles, which either at
the bottom of the crater or the interior fides of the mountain
suffer the vapours to escape.           When we arrived at the crater,
we    were   desirous to  ascertain    whether    these vapours were of        a,
noxious quality    :   we   walked   through     them,    and inspired them
several   times,   but   felt  no  inconvenience         from    them. The
thermometer placed         in  one  of  these  spiracles    indicated    54 de
grees,   in  another   it rose  only   to 22.    In  all  these  experiments
our instrument was covered with           a   humid matter, which was
soon dissipated in the open air without leaving any traces.
    In traversing the surface of the crater, we perceived              a  focus
half   covered    by   alarge   mass     of  pumice     stone,   and   which,
from its whole circumference, emitted               a   strong heat. The
thermometer placed at first at the entrance or                   it, and then
immersed to as great        a depth   as  the  nature    of  the  ground and
the heat woukl admit, never rose higher than 22 degrees.
This singularity surprised us, but we were not able to ex
plain it.
    The volcanic productions which we observed in the whole
crater were lava, exceedingly porous, and which the fire in
certain places had reduced to scoriœ.           It   was of dark brown
                                                             a
colour, and sometimes reddish, but               it   is   rare to find any
white.      The substances      nearest    the   spiracles are all covered
or impregnated with sulphur.                This mineral     is   found very
                                                                          often

cessary that we should think of returning.       The descent is
far less laborious than the ascent ; for it is difficult to climb
eminences where the points of support are so moveable.        Be
sides, people cannot ascend but one at a time in succession,
after long intervals, for fear of burying under a torrent of
volcanic matters those who follow, as the foot, when moved,
displaces the ashes, &c. to the distance of thirty feet round.
   When we arrived at the two precipices, we were obliged
to ascend by mounting on the shoulders of a man placed at
the bottom, and laying hold of a stick held by another at the
top, and to rest our feet no where but in a very gentle man
ner. At length, by prudence and caution, we reached the
summit of Vesuvius without any accident, but exhausted
with fatigue, and so covered with ashes and smoke, as to be
scarcely distinguishable.    Our six companions, who had not
descended into the crater, were overjoyed when they saw us
again, and supplied us with some refreshments, of which we
had great need.
   When one grand difficulty is surmounted, inferior ones
are overlooked, as of little importance. In less than twenty-
five minutes we again descended, having confirmed, after
examining various stones, this observation, that Vesuvius is
the only known volcano which throws up from its bowels
primordial substances, without being altered by the fire, and
such as are found at present in banks and veins.
   At half after eight in the morning %ve arrived at Portici, the
inhabitants of which were much surprised to see us return all
safe.   Their delicious fruits, and their excellent wine called
lacryma Cbrijli, soon made us forget our fatigue, and we
then proceeded to Naples, which we reached in safety.

     The result of this excursion, which was only an experi
 ment, can be of no further use than to show the possibility
 of reaching the crater, and to open the way to it to philoso
 phers, naturalists, and chemists, who, by exploring this
 immense furnace of nature at their leisure, will find a variety
 of matters which will afford an ample field for the application
 of their chemical knowledge, and may enable them            " to make
 discoveries interesting to the arts and the sciences.
     The names of the eight Frenchmen, in the order in which
 they descended, are as follow : Debeer, secretary to the am

 the army of observation ; Fresfinet and Asluras, French
travellers ; and Moulin, inspector of posts.
XXII.       Observations     on  a dejlrutlive   Kind of InfeSs^Jbutid
    in some Parts of the Ruffian Empire, and in           the Bannat of
    Tcmefvjar.       By Professor Pallas *.
  VV E are indebted to my friend Brunnich for the first ac
count of this destructive infect, hitherto observed only in the
Bannat of Temeswar in Europe.                   Linnæus, in the short
                                        f
description which he gave of it from an account transmitted
to him, compares it to that small gnat {culex equinus) which
infests horses.        Its principal colour is blackisli; its breast
projects in a round form, and the hinder part of the body is
oval ; the legs are pretty long ; the thighs towards the body
are white, but black^underneath            ; the covering of the thighs
mostly white, at the extremity blackish, the joints of the legs
black, and the wings transparent.
    According to this description, I found the greatest simi
larity between the gnat of the Bannat and the Russian mofeb-
iara, or stinging gnat J, which, after an attentive compari
son, I find to agree perfectly with the creeping gnat {culex
reptans) of Linnæus; and I suspected, from what I knew
ot the abundance and destructive nature of the Siberian in
fects, that the gnat of the Bannat might belong to the larger
and more pernicious kinds in the warm mountainous districts
of that country. I was, however, deceived in my conjecture,

   (cefints).
       In this uncertainty,       the last circumstance led me to con
  jecture that Griselim, perhaps, might not be a very expe
   rienced entomologist ; and as he described his insect in the
   time of harvest, and as the real destructive gnats appear oo.
   the other hand in the spring, I suspected that Professor Brun-
  nich might have described the proper insect, and that Grise-
   lini had only seen some of the other kinds, which appear in
   large swarms.         My doubts on this subject induced me to
  apply to Baron von Born, to whose information I had often
   been before indebted ; and by his means I obtained a small
   collection of real Columbach gnats, among which I distin-
                 on the first view, the Russian mojcbkara of a confi-
     erable size, and even an insect which I had so often wished
  Suished,
  to procure when collecting plants and insects in the Altai
  mountains, and on the Volga.                   . ^.
       They are small flies, as thick but much shorter than the
  common gnats, and which, according to their characteristic
  marks and form, have a greater resemblance to the bib'toœt
  of Geoffrey than to gnats. Their breast, which is strong,
_
  projects in a round form ; the head is flat, and at the top
  ends in a sharp oblique edge, has at the sides oblong eyes,
  and below tapers to a proboscis, which ends in two sliarp
  points, not unlike the sting of the gnat ; the feelers are of a
   brownish yellow colour, thick and sharp pointed, placed near
  each other on the forehead ; the legs are much shorter than
   those of the gnat ; the thighs and part next the joints of the
  legs are all white, and only blackish towards the ends; pp
  some the thighs towards the body were whitish; the extremity
  of the body, which appears very dry and contracted, is sur
  rounded with rings of brown, but the breast appears black,

 {haded with grey ; the wings, which are pretty large and
 broad, appear whitish, with their veins, and lie over each
 other.
    Such I found the Columbach gnat, and I have seen the
 Siberian tnofcbara, or that common in the neighbourhood
 of the Volga, perfectly similar, only that it was somewhat
 smaller, and had not so broad white rings on the legs. I en
 tertain no doubt, therefore, that they are both of the fame
 species.    I am also convinced that the culex reftans of Lin
 næus   is nothing else than the same insect which is sound
 in the northern countries, somewhat smaller and not in such
abundance.
    Linnæus found great multitudes of the latter in the moun
tainous districts ot Lapland, whereas in Sweden they are
more uncommon. According to his observations, they attack
          principally towards Tun-set, crawl over their whole
Kople
    dies, even into the mouth, nose, and eyes, and cannot be
driven away like other gnats, by shaking or blowing. If his
description in the Fauna SuecKa be compared with ours, it
will be sound very little different.
    These troublesome flies are found here and there in the
northern forests of Russia, but singly, and for the most part
they run about among the hair of the cattle. But on the
Volga, below Kasan, where that river begins to flow between
woody mountains, and approaches a warmer district, parti
cularly from the neighbourhood of Simbirsk to Saratof and
 Kamyschenka, they are met with from the end of May to
the beginning of June in such astonishing multitudes in low
bushy places, and the woody hills sheltered from the wind,
that they seem to fill the atmosphere, like hail, falling blindly
and with violence against the face, which is affected as if sand
were thrown against it; they sty into the eyes, nose, and
mouth, adhere pertinaciously to the skin, and with their
blunt trunks pierce it often in such a manner as to occasion
pain, so that a bloody puncture remains, though without
itching. Fishermen, hunters, and all those, who, by their
employments, are exposed to the open air, or who travel,
furnish themselves about the above period with a large net-
cap soaked in birch oil, because it has been observed that
tiie mofcbka, however blindly they rush against every thing,
 never venture to  fly against those open nets which have been
 soaked in the above strong- smelling oil. Without these means
it  would often be impossible to open the eyes. When the in
 sect has an opportunity of fastening itself on the skin unper-
 ceived, and ot sucking the blood,      itfills its belly till it
                                                               ap
 peal like a    blown-up bladder, and cannot be removed but

 and perhaps they are to be found also in North America.
     It is commonly reported, in the Siberian and Ural moun
 tains, that these small insects, with the assistance of the gad
Jlies, which abound about the fame period, torment horses,
 and other cattle, in such a manner as to occasion their death
 when they ran about in the forests, and have no opportunity
 of escaping to the open country, or to a fire, the smoke of
 which would drive them away. Instances of this, however,
 are not so frequent in these countries as, according to every1
  account, they must be in the Bannat of Temeswar. The
 cause of this, perhaps, is to be ascribed to the creat size of
 these gnats in the latter country, and perhaps also to some
 poisonous quality connected with their sting; for I have ob
 served, even in Siberia, that their sting sometimes occasioned
 on the human body large tumours, which scarcely disappeared
 at the end of forty-eight hours.
     I shall not here repeat what Griselini, whether true or false,
  ha9 related ot these insects.    I should have considered many
  of the particulars which he states, as containing too much
  of the marvellous, had not Baron Born, in his Letters, con- .
  firmed the accounts given of the destructive nature of these
  vermin in that country.     " They come to the Bannat of Te
  meswar," says he,      " by millions, as soon as the bloom ap
  pears on the trees in the spring; fall upon the cattle, creep
  through the rectum, the nostrfls, and the ears, mto the most
  interior parts of their bodies, and kill them in four or five
  hours. When the animal is opened they are found adhering

                      On some Kinds           of Gilding.
  X HE     value which has always been set on articles made of
 gold, has induced artists to devise means for giving to works
 of other metals, by covering them with a thin stratum of gold,
 a greater value than they really possess. Hence the origin of
 gilding.
   In     real   gilding,     the metal is either immediately covered
 with leaf gold, or         an amalgam is formed of gold and quick
 silver, with which          the metal is rubbed over, and the quick
 silver is then sublimated by means of heat.
     In gilding, a great deal depends on cleaning properly the
 surface of the metal to which the gilding is to be applied,
 because the union   of the gold with the metal becomes then
 more intimate.     Silver, topper, brass, and pinchbec, may
 be easily gilded, either by means of gold leaf, or of gold
 amalgamated with mercury ; but iron and steel with diffi
 culty; nor can so durable a gilding be given to them as to
 other metals by any processes yet known.      The cause of this
 is,that the surface of iron or steel during the process of gild
 ing cannot be kept thoroughly clean.
                 Gilding Iron      or Steel   with Gold Leaf.
   In this  process the metal must be heated before the gold
leaf can  be applied, which exposes      to the risque of having
                                                  it
its surface oxidated, besides the danger of having the temper
at the fame time brought too low, when sword^blades, dag
gers, and the like, are subjected to the process.
          Gilding with Amalgam and Nitrate     Mercury.    of
   In    gilding iron or steel      by
                               means of an amalgam, the diffi
 culty and the danger of miscarrying are still greater  for, as ;
 the metal has no affinity for the mercury, an agent must be
employed to dispose the surface to receive the gilding.    For
                                                           this

             for   the Use os Ar lists, Manufaclurers,     &c.       145
this purpose a solution os mercury in nitrous acid (aquafortis),
or what the workmen call quicksilver water, is applied to the
parts intended to be gilded : the acid, by a stronger affinity,
seizes on a portion or the iron, and deposits in the place of it
a thin coating of mercury, which will not refuse a union
afterwards with the gold amalgam that may be applied ; but
by this process the surface of the metal is injured by the ni
trous acid, and the union of the mercury is very slight, so
that a bright and durable gilding cannot be obtained.
       Gilding         Amalgam and Sulphate of Copper.
                    <witb
   Sometimes a solution of sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) is
applied, with a camel's hair pencil, to the parts of the steel
intended to be gilt.     By a chemical action exactly similar to
what we have described as taking place when a solution of
nitrate of mercury is employed, a thin coating of copper is
precipitated on the metal. Copper having an affinity for
mercury, a kind of union may by this means be effected be
tween the amalgam and the iron or steel, as the case may be.
   In whichever of these ways the amalgam be brought into
union with the steel, the surface is injured by the action of
the acid employed, and still a heat sufficient to volatilize the
mercury must be afterwards employed. Most artists, there
fore, follow the first process, that of applying gold leaf, and
burnishing it down on the article while hot ; which, though
a laborious process, is attended with less risk of the surface
being injured.
         An improved        Process   for gilding Iron   or Steel.
  This   process, which is less known among artists than it
deserves to be, may prove useful to those who have occasion
to gild iron or steel.    The first part of the process consists in
pouring   over  a solution  of gold in nitro- muriatic acid (aqua
regia)  about  twice   as much   æther, which must be done with
caution, and in a large vessel.        These liquids must then be
shaken together: as soon as the mixture is at rest, the æther
will be seen to separate itself from the nitro-muriatic acid,
and to float on the surface. The nitro-muriatic acid becomes
more transparent, and (he æther darker than they were be
fore ; the reason of which      is,
                                that the æther has taken the gold
from the acid. The whole mixture          then to be poured into
                                            is                        a

aperture must not be opened till the fluids have completely
separated themselves from each other.               It  then to be

the funnel will then be found to contain nothing but æther
mixed with the gold ; which is to be put into well-closed
bottles, and preserved for use. In order to gild iron or steel,
the metal must be first well polished with the finest emery, or
rather with the finest crocus mar/is or colcotbar of vitriol and
common brandy. The auriferous æther is then to be applied
with a small brush ; the æther soon evaporates, and the gold
remains on the surface of the metal; the metal may then be
put into the fire, and afterwards polished. By means of this
auriferous æther all kinds of figures may be delineated on
iron by employing a pen or sine brush, k is in this manner,
we believe, that the Sohlinger sabre blades are gilded.        As
every artist has not an opportunity of procuring a recipe for
the preparation of the nitro-muriatic acid and æther, we (hall
here give processes for both.
             Preparation of the Nitro-muriatic Acid.
    In a sufficient quantity of nitrous acid dissolve as much
sal-ammoniac as it can take up in a cool place.          Into this
nitro-muriatic acid put the gold, after it has been reduced to
fine powder by being filed or beat into thin leaves, and de
posit it in a warm place until it is dissolved.      This solution
has a golden-yellow colour, and gives a purple tint to animal
 bodies.
                    Preparation of the Æther.
    Put into a large retort one pound and a half of the strongest-
 spirit of wine, and pour gradually into it two pounds of the
 strongest sulphuric acid ; shaking the retort a little each time
the acid is poured in.     The liquid will become hot, and the
vapours, disengaged with force, will diffuse a penetrating and
 agreeable odour. When you have poured in all the sulphuric
 acid, rinse the neck of the retort by pouring in half a pound
 more alcohol ; and having mixed the whole thoroughly, suffer
 it to stand for some time well closed up.
     Then place the retort with the mixture in a sand-bath, and
 adapt to it a capacious receiver, and make a fire under the
 retort. The heat however must be flow, and so moderate
 that the receiver may never be heated by it. The distillation
 must be continued until a sulphurous odour, instead of the
 agreeable one, is observed at the mouth of the receiver.      For
 this purpose the receiver may be now and then emptied, by
 which means the odour can be at all times observed.
     When the distillation is ended you will have obtained an
 æther; which however always contains partly a little acidu
 lous water, and partly some spirit of wine.

                                                                             again     it

in order to absorb the acid, place                       in a   very gentle sand-

   What remains after the first distillation consists) for the
most part, of sulphuric acid impregnated with sulphurous gas
and with carbonaceous matter furnished      the decomposition    by
of   the alcohol.
     This      residuum      may be again employed for the preparation
of   æther.          For this  purpose pour over    good spirit of wine,

     As   it sometimes difficult to procure alcohol ready pre
               is

will be found very advantageous to artists                       :
   Take well dried potash and pour over     spirit of wine the it                        :
latter will not unite with the potash, but the water which                                     it
may contain will be taken up           that alkali. byThe spirit of
wine       then to be poured into another glass, and subjected
          is
to the same operation as before.        This process      to be re               is
peated till        observed that the potash

the fingers or a piece of leather or of cork, by which means
the fine particles of gold they contain will be left on the sur
face of the metal.     If the silver be then washed, so as to re
move the remaining part of the allies, the silver will have
scarcely any appearance of gilding; but on being burnished
it will assume a beautiful gold colour. This method of gilding
 is very easy, and requires very little gold.

   Fine instruments of brass, in order that their  surface may

   Provide a saturated solution of gold, and, having evaporated
it to the consistence of oil, sufler it to (hoot into crystals.
These crystals must then be dissolved in pure water, and
the articles to he gilded being immersed in it are then to
be washed in pure water, and afterwards burnished.          This
         may be repeated several times till the articles have
 >een well gilt.
firocess            A solution of gold crystals is preferred to a
mere   solution  of gold, because in the latter there is always
a portion of free acid, which will not fail to exercise more or
less action on the surface of the brass or copper, and injure
its polisti.

      Various articles     n>ade   of   brass have sometimes   an appear
 ance      as   if
             they were gilded.     This appearance, however, is
 produced by means of a solution of gum-lac in spirit of
 wine, with which they are rubbed over. As long as the
 lac lasts, they retain their splendour.   These articles, how
 ever, are attended with this inconvenience, that they must:
 never be cleaned with a strong brush, or scoured with chalk
 and the like, but only be wiped with a soft rag; for as soon
 as the lac is rubbed off they lose their brilliancy. varnisti  A

                       be prepared
    Dissolve two ounces of very pure and sine gum-lac in
 4.8 ounces of alcohol, and place the solution in a sand-bath
 exposed to a moderate heat.        To prevent the too abundant
 evaporation of the spirit of wine, as well as the bursting of
 the glass, a piece of bladder ought to be bound over the
 latter, and a few holes made in it with a needle.     In another
 glass dissolve, in the fame quantity of spirit of wine, an ounce
 of dragon's blood in grains. When both the solutions are
 completed, mix them together; then put three grains of yel
 low wood into       it,
                      and suffer   to remain there twelve hours

                           To  Mr. Tdloch.
        SIR,                                   Paiis, October 13, iSor.
 D,URING            my stay here, on my return from England,
 I  have had the satisfaction of meeting often the celebrated
 Italian  professor   Volta, who, in company with his friend
 Brugnatelli,   professor  of chemistry at Pavia, has undertaken
a   philosophical journey to this metropolis to give and to col
lect information.       I have been repeatedly a witness to a most
ingenious    and  interesting series of experiments, by which pro
 fessor Volta demonstrates     the evident identity between what
 has been called the galvanic fluid and common electricity. A
 short exposition of the leading facts will not, perhaps, be un
acceptable to your philosophical readers.
    He begins by showing, with the help of his conductor
 and a common electrometer made with two hanging bits of
straw, a new and fundamental fact in electrics, viz. that dif
ferent metals (and even other substances) mutually impart
to one another, by a mere dry contact, a certain quantity of
electricity : after this exchange, riiade rather by a kind of
impulse than by affinity, they are sound to possess opposite
states of electricity, easily demonstrable by the common test
with sealing-wax.
    He (hows afterwards, that if a system of two different metals
be disposed in the following order— copper, zinc, copper —
without any intermediate conducting liquid, no change of
the electric state takes place in that cafe ; because the influ
ence of the copper on zinc on one fide, is balanced by a
similar and contrary influence on the other.           But if a piece
of wet paper be put between, then the electrical equilibrium
is immediately destroyed by the contact, and the phænomena
                      '
appear.
    The better the conducting liquid happens to be, the greater
is the effect. Thus brine or acidulated water act more strongly,
                                  K 3                              than

than pure water, merely as better conductors.    This fact he
also proves by direct experiments.
   On these three fundamental facts he then builds his whole
fabric.   Let the apparatus be a pile, a series of cups, or a
 trough, his theoretical , positions answer equally well.           He
 explains, among many curious pbænomena, why the Vol
 taic pile charges a large Leyden jar, by a single instantaneous
 contact, much more than the electrical machine in the lame
 circumstance.
     He thus transfers, from a pile of 100 or 200 couples, to a
 very large Leyden jar, and even to a battery, by a single
 contact, which lasts not above i-ioth of a second, the same
 degree of electrical charge which the electrometer sliows to
 exist in the pile, and the faculty of giving a sliock equally
.strong.     Thole experiments require the most perfect conti
 nuity    in  the conductors; metallic chains must therefore be
 excluded from the circuit.
     The frogs and other animals put in motion after death by
 what has been hitherto called the galvanic influence, are in
 his theory but mere electrometers.          He sliows, in particular,
 that a half frog, disposed in the common way, is almost in
 definitely susceptible of muscular contractions by merely in
 verting alternately its position relative to the direction of the
 electrical current : that   is,  when blunted, for instance, bv    a
 number of discharges palling from the right leg to the left,
it   recovers its whole susceptibility  if    it  be but half turned
 round,   so   as to reverse the course the fluid takes    ;  and this
 repeatedly    fora  long  while,  till bordering  on putrefaction.
     A commission chosen among the ablest electricians in the
 National Institute, has been named to examine both the
 theory of the learned professor and the experiments on which
it   is grounded.     He intends to collect soon, in one single
  performance, the most essential facts and inferences he has
  published at different times on the subject; and in the mean
  time my friend Mr. De      la   Metherie prepares for the Journal
  de Physique an account more circumstantial than the slight
  sketch  I  am now forwarding to you, rather fit,    I    confess, to
  excite than to gratify your curiosity.

  On the Influence which the Sun has                 on the State    of  the
                 Barometer.       By   J. J. II EMM ER*.
    WHEN philosophy, in modern times, emerged from that
lamentable state of darkness in which it was for io many vears
involved, and philosophers employed the more rational and
certain way of observation and experience for examining the
nature of things, all the assertions and opinions of the anttents
respecting the influence of the heavenly hodies were subjected
to more accurate investigation.             Some, as being contrary to
experience, were totally rejected ; others were retained, and
placed beyond all doubt, as they evidently coincided with
nature ; and others were classed among uncertainties, as ex
perience furnished nothing decisive for or against them.
Among the number of the Tatter, according to most modern
philosophers, is the opinion that a part of the wonderful va
riations which we observe in the barometer are to be ascribed
to the essects of the fun and moon, and other heavenly bo
dies. This opinion, indeed,- after a long series of experiments
and researches, appeared to Pascal, Garcin, Wallis, Halley,
De la Hire, Mariotte, Woodward, Leibnitz, Mairon, Ber
noulli, Muschenbroek, De Luc, &c. so little supported by
proofs drawn from nature, that they did not think proper to
mention it. This, however, is much to be wondered at in
regard to De Luc, as he fays in his work on the atmosphere,
that it is attracted with more or less force by the planets, ac
cording to their different distances.

                      On the Influence of the Sun
   Some celebrated philosophers, however, of the present
day have confidently believed, that if the variations of the ba
rometer were carefully compared with the different positions
and distances of the heavenly bodies, and particularly of the
fun and moon, it would be found that many considerable va
riations of the state of the mercury in the Torricellian tube
are effected by them.          For, as the flux and reflux of the sea
depend     on  the  sun  and   moon, it cannot be doubted that in
the atmosphere       of the   earth, which is much lighter than the
water of the sea, movements of the fame kind, which have
an influence on the barometer, must take place. The first
experiments on this subject were made about fifteen years
ago by the celebrated Lambert, who employed for that pur
pose eleven years observations            of the barometer made by
Doppelmayer        of  Nuremberg,       and  compared them with the
apogeum      and   perigeum    of the  moon.    He was not able, how
ever,   to  obtain   any  certain   result, and  considered the period
of  the observations     as too short.
   Toaldo, who was furnistied with much more abundant
materials, resumed the subject, and by means of the forty
years observations of the Marquis de Poleni and son, with
eight years of his own, had a series of forty-eight years ob
servations.      After a laborious comparison of these with
the apsides, syzigies, and quadratures of the moon, and
•with the passage of the moon and fun through the signs of
the zodiac, he thought he discovered undoubted proofs of a
perceptible influence of the moon and fun on the baromejter.
M. Frisi of Milan endeavoured to controvert this assertion,
which had been the result of so much labour, and maintained
that the variations of our atmosphere have no similitude to
the flux and reflux of the sea, and can admit of no compari
son, as the latter is regular and invariable, the former only
temporary. The flux and reflux of the sea, in regard to time
and duration, are so certain, that there are tables of them
for all the principal sea-ports, which never err ; whereas the
variations of the atmosphere are at the same time in differ
ent places, and in the fame place at different times, so
great, that where it rains at one period for three or four
months it is sometimes as long without rain. It sufficiently
appears at present,         from mathematical calculations, that
during the passage of the moon or fun, from the "horizon to
the meridian, the daily height of the barometer cannot be
changed more than T'T of a line, Paris measure, by the effect
of the former, and about Tirt by the effect of the latter.
   To many, however, Frist's reasons did not appear so con
clusive as to make them give over their researches on this subr
                               *
                                                                 jectj

   ect ; and in particular, most        of  the members        of our meteoro-
] ogical    society, among whom M. Steiclehner, Planer, and
 Chiminello, have taken great pains. The first fays, that he
 found, by several comparative observations, that the greatest
 fall of the barometer does not happen in very remote places
 at the fame time, but that it is earlier towards the west, and
 later towards the east, and that the difference of the time is
nearly equal to the difference of the meridians of the places; an
assertion which indeed deserves to be more accurately examined.
     M. Planer observed the barometer for a whole year, fix
 times every day, or every fourth hour of the natural day, at
 two, fix, and ten in the morning, and at the fame hours
 after noon ; and found, in general, that the barometer, be
 tween ten in the morning and two in the afternoon, and be
 tween ten at night and two in the morning, was less in its
 rising, and greater in its fall ; and that the contrary was the
  cafe between the hours of fix and ten in the evening and
 morning.         M. Chiminello observed the barometer twenty-
 two times a day for three years, but he left a chasm in the
 night which he supplied by calculation.                  The principal po
  sitions which he thence deduced, are, that the barometer
  falls towards noon, as well as towards midnight *.
     # In examining a twelve-months' Register, kept by •            Dunbar, Esq.
  near the banks of the Miffisippi, in N. lat. 310 18', and long. 910 30' W.
  of Greenwich, which, for the greater facility of comparison, 1 have laid
  down, with others, on a scale in the manner I have heretofore exhibited,
  there occurs a remarkable instance of a diurnal variation.         For the space
  of about four days before, and fix days after the summer solstice, the ba-
  rometer regularly rises from about 9 P. M. to about 6 A. M. then falls till
  the return of the former hour in the evening, then rises again as before,
  &c.in alternate periods.     In the first four days the direction is ascending,
  and the eltvation of a line drawn through the mean is about
                                                                       T|T of an
  inch. In the latter six days the mean line is perfectly horizontal, the ele.
 vation each night amounting to - g„, and the depression each day to the
  fame, but occupying double time.        The times above given are those at
  which the observations were made, but it is probable that the maximum
  and minimum each day corresponded rather with the times of fun-rife and
  fun-set.    The first period of four days was dry, with a temperature of 920
  in the middle of the day. This ended in a thunder storm, on the 21st of
 the month, with 0,82 inches of rain. The barometer, after this, rose            *_
  in the night, then remained mostly stationary, with cloudy weather, until
  the evening of the 26th, beginning a second period of six days, during
   which brisk winds at S. S. E. and S. W. prevailed with rain every after
  noon or evening, amounting, in all, to 1,7 inches. Temperature         850. The
   whole occupied just the space between full and new moon ; and there are
  traces of the operation of this periodical influence in other parts of the
  Register.
     I  (hall not presume, at present, to ascribe this variation entirely to plane
  tary influence ; but the facts are worthy examination in that respect. L. H.

j^4                   On the Influence   of the Sun
    The   observations   of these three men   afford some indications
of the influence which the heavenly bodies have on the baro
meter, and to which M. Planer ascribes part of the effects :
but he is far from proving this; for the number of the places
the observations were made at, which M. Steiglehner com
pared, were not above three, and consequently too few to de
termine the question. The case is the fame with the fix ob
servations of M. Planer, made daily, as has been observed
by M. Chiminello.          And might not what is ascribed to the
          of four hours have happened in the last hour, or the
  aft half-hour? Chiminello' 9 experiments are of more im
{•eriod
portance, but for want of night observations they are still
defective and imperfect.
    In this respect, however, I was more fortunate, as I had
an easy and lure method of following all the variations of the
barometer, and even the smallest, by night as well as bv day.
I  had in mv possession, at that lime, a barometer, belonging
to the Electoral Physical Museum, invented lately, by M.
Changeux, and called a barometrograph, which being con
nected with a clock shows the state of the mercury every
four minutes, by means of a point impressed on a moveable
plate.     I began on the '2ist of May 1785 to make use of
this excellent instrument, and it appeared to me, by repeated
observation, that a continual variation took place towards
noon as well as towards midnight.             By more accurate ob
servation, I found that this variation in the mercury consists,
at least, in an inclination to fall.      But that I might be more
certain in treating a question of so much importance,            I re
solved to compare all the observations from the first day to the
end of the year, which are printed in five volumes of our
Ephemcrides.         In that time I found that the passage of the
fun over the meridian bv day and by night had taken place
446 times, aud consequently as many variations of the baro
meter were to be considered.          From the most accurate com
parison,    the following    three rules presented themselves :
     1st, When the fun passes the meridian, the barometer, if
in the act of falling, continues to fall, and the falling is
accelerated.
     2d, When the fun passes the meridian, the barometer, if
 in the   act of rising, falls, or becomes stationary, or rises more
slowly.
     3d, When the surf passes the meridian, the barometer,
which is stationary, falls, if it has not risen before or aftec
being stationary; in which case it usually becomes stationary
 during the fun's passage.
     The first rule had only one exception, the second none,

and the third six. The last were all in (he night-time ex
cept one.    On this occasion, the barometer during the fun's
passage over the meridian stood still, though it fell before
and after.    When these seven exceptions are deducted from
the 446 variations there remain 439, which accord with the
rules.    When I fay, however, 'that these variations took
place during the fun's passage over the meridian, I do not
mean by that expression the very moment when the fun is
exactly in the meridian, but the whole period when he is
near it.
    All these variations took place between eleven o'clock and
half after one, consequently within the space of an hour and
a half; except six, five of which happened half an hour or
a quarter before eleven, and one about an hour after noon ;
which, indeed, must be ascribed to a particular cause, which
either hastened or retarded the effect of the general cause. Of
the above-mentioned 439 variations, 54 took place after twelve
o'clock, and all the rest before one.
    As it is therefore certain that the barometer during the
passageof the fun over the meridian is always inclined to fall,
it cannot be doubted that the cause of so invariable a phæ-
nomenon, which follows so remarkable laws, and recurs at
the fame time under the like circumstances, must be constant
and invariable.      It is at present well known that the prin
cipal atmospheric cause of the falling of the barometer is
heat and evaporation. But it appears, on closer examination,
that neither of these can produce the phænomenon in ques
tion.    What M. De Luc, however, says *, that the least
height of the barometer, when no particular cause intervenes,
always takes place about the hottest part of the day, which
in every season is about -j of the artificial day, might lead to
a suspicion that the falling of the barometer about noon pro
ceeds from the heat.       For, as there is a considerable increase
of heat about noon, a perceptible falling of the mercury about
the same time must be connected with            until, in the above-
                                                        it,
mentioned part of the day, the mercury reaches its lowest
state, and the heat attains to its maximum.        But      we admit  if
 that the greatest heat commonly takes place about the            of                 '
 the day, experience forbids us to ascribe to the same period
 the greatest falling of the mercury.          have therefore con
                                                      I
 structed  a  table in which the lowest state of the mercury for
 each day of the month, between noon and the evening, or
 night,  isgiven from the above-mentioned barometrographic

 observations     *. This state of the barometer takes           place when
 the mercury ceases to fall and afterwards begins to rife, or
 before rising is stationary.         When it does not rife after noon,
 but (inks continually or by intervals, the lowest state after
 noon must be at midnight.              The cafe is the fame when it
 first rises  after   noon,   and   afterwards    falls towards the end of
 the natural day.        But    when     it  continually rises after noon,
 though      this  movement       may     be  interrupted by its once be
 coming stationary,       the  lowest   state  when it falls early, or when
 this   does    not   happen,    is  to  be   considered    as taking place
 about    twelve   at noon.      When      in  this cafe  a frequent falling
 takes place in the morning, I have observed that it was nearest
 noon and the 4 of the day : when the quicksilver rose and
 fell several times between noon and evening, I marked several
 hours, without further examining at which the state of the
 barometer was lowest.
     Now it appears from these tables, that in 222 days the
lowest state of the barometer corresponded only ten times
with the       I   of the day ; on the other hand, it deviated
 from that period ten times about half an hour, at other
times a whole hour, and often half a day; and consequently
De Luc's rule, at least according to my observations, is not
 correct.
     We may therefore ask those who ascribe the falling of the
barometer to heat, Why mould this cause be so closely con
fined to the period between 1 1 in the morning and the middle
of the first hour after midnight ? Why does it not take place
earlier or later, when the mercury rises continually the whole
day, or several days either fall a little towards noon, or at
least become stationary or rise slowly ? and, Why does not
this rather take place several hours after noon, the time at
which the heat generally is the greatest ?
     But that heat is not the cause of this phænomenon is proved
by the falling of the mercury at midnight; which is no less
common and certain than the falling at noon: on account of
the cold, it ought then rather to rise or to fall.
    We may assert the same thing of vapour as of heat, as
these have the closest connection with each other.                        As a
certain accumulation of vapours dissolved in the atmosphere
makes the air lighter, and obliges the barometer to fall, the
power with which it acts on the instrument must be in pro
portion to its quantity.            When it obliges the barometer,

therefore, to fall towards noon, why docs the latter so often
rife afterwards? What then lessens the quantity of these
vapours when the heat, which by its nature promotes their
solution, still increases, or at any rate does not become less ?
 How does it happen that the barometer falls in the night ? as
about that time the vapours are, for the most part, precipi
tated from the atmosphere.           Why do they exercise the
greatest force exactly at midnight? and, By what law of
 nature are they more connected with that than with any
 other period ?
     It may here evidently be seen, that the constant falling of
 the barometer about noon and midnight can be occasioned
 neither by heat nor by the effect of vapours.
     Besides these two causes, and the winds, we are acquainted
 with no others in our atmosphere which can make the baro
 meter to fall. But as the wind often becomes calm about
  noon and midnight, or, when it blows, is of such a nature
 that it does not make the column of air which presses on the
  barometer lighter, it is evident that the falling of the mer
  cury about these times cannot arise from the wind.
      What then remains but to seek without our atmosphere
  for the cause of this phænomcnon ? It is evident that it is to
  be found in the fun ; for, as by its attraction it moves the
  water of the ocean, it must exercise a still stronger action on
  the column of air; and from what is known respecting the
  flux and reflux of the sea, the whole phænomenon may be
  easily explained.    In the first place, as the atmospheric flux
  and reflux themselves must depend on the fun's passage over
  the meridian, it must also take place both at the diurnal and
   the nocturnal passage of the fun ; because the flux and reflux
   of the atmosphere, like those of the sea, must happen at the
   same time on opposite sides of the terrestrial hemisphere.    In
   the last place, the atmospheric flux which produces the falling
   of our barometer is only an effect of the flux which takes
   place between the tropics, where the air during the passage,
   of the fun ascends, and therefore proceeds thence from us,
   as happens in all the tides of the sea which lie beyond these
   circles.   That these tides, which arise by communication, ^fe
   transmitted more speedily and by a longer duration inr'the
    atmosphere than in the ocean, may be concluded from this
    circumstance, that the particles of the air have less gravity
    and less mutual adhesion.

     Pepys jun. Esq. reffetl'ing     the Ejsecls   of the Oxymuriatic
     Acid  on the Growth    of Plants*  .
         My  clear Friend,                  Higham Lodge, Sept. 7, 1801.'
   JL  HE    few   experiments   I made    on the effects of the oxy
 genated muriatic acid on the growth of plants, I conceive to
 be too insignificant to merit much attention : however, at thy
 desire,  I  here relate them, and give thee the few thoughts
 that have occurred respecting them.
     From what M. Humboldt aslerts respecting raising seeds
                                                                          '
 so very rapidly by means of the oxymuriatic acid, the ques-
 tion occurred to me, whether it might not be successfully
 used for raising early crops of mustard and cress, radishes,
 &c. and therefore early in March I sowed two patches of
 each (as well as of some other plants) in a sheltered situation
 in the open air, and kept one of each constantly moist in
 the common way, and the other with a mixture of one large
 tea-spoonful of oxymuriatic acid to a pint of water; and in
 no instance did there appear to be any difference with respect
 to the time of germination.
     I then trjed the same experiment on two pots of balsams
in a hot-bed, and also on some coxcombs. Those balsams
moistened with the diluted oxymuriatic acid all came up in
 00 hours, whilst none of the others appeared till near 30
 hours after ; and the combs came up about in the fame pro-                 ¦
portion.      I shall next give the particulars of an experiment
 1 made in warmer weather in the open             air. On the 2d of
May I set four different lots of garden beans, with three in
each lot, in the following manner :
    Lot 1. I soaked in 24 drops of oxymuriatic acid, diluted
with two large tea-spoonfuls of water, for seven hours, and,
immediately before I took them out, added six drops of acid
more.
    Lot 2. I soaked in twelve drops of acid and two spoonfuls
of water for the fame time, and, immediately before 1 took
them out, added three drops more.
    Lot 3. I soaked for the same time in plain water.
    Lot 4. were not soaked at all.
    These were then all planted at the same depth in a sheltered
border, and lots 1, 2, and 3, kept constantly moist with oxy
muriatic acid diluted with water in the proportion of one
large tea-spoonful to a pint.
    On May 13, one of No. 2 came up, and on the morning
of the 14th one each of Nos. 1 and 3, of which No. 1 was

forwardest; and in the course of the day the others of lots
 I, 2, and 3, appeared. On the 16th thrv all looked finely;
but thole of lot 1 were largest, and thole of lot 2 larger than
lot 3 : thole of lot 4, which were kept watered with plain
water, did not come up till the 18th, or perhaps one of them
on the evening of the 17th. On June 5 they were all nearly
fully grown ; but those of No. 1 were considerably stunted,
and those of lot 2 somewhat so, and neither of them were so
fine as those of lots 3 and 4.
     In the latter end of spring and beginning of summer I tried
the same experiments on lome other plants, but, from not
 being constantly at home, could not make them with suffi
 cient accuracy; however, enough so to determine that those
 moistened with dilute oxymuriatic acid came up first.
     In the experiment on the beans, we find that those soaked '
 and moistened with the dilute acid came up some days before
 those that were only watered in the common way, and that
 those which had the most acid at first were the forwardest,
 and apparently most flourishing plants, though afterwards
 they the most rapidly declined; and therefore I conclude
  (though more experiments are wanting on this subject posi
 tively to determine), 1st, That the diluted oxymuriatic acid
 only in a certain temperature           hath the effect of promoting
 an earlier germination of seeds than would otherwise take
 place : and, 2d, From the plants at first growing more rapidly
 than those watered in the common way, but afterwards de
 clining so as to be surpassed by them, that the oxymuriatic
 acid possesses no nutritive quality, but acts merely as a sti
  mulus, and. therefore cannot be applied advantageously to the
  purposes of horticulture.         I am very truly and respectfully

  160             On the Question, whether mixed Metals
 struck exhale a certain odour. The antients were acquainted
with the        smell of the semi-metals, experiments on which
were made by Boyle. But I do not find in any of the mine-
ralogical works of the moderns that the purity or alloy of the
noble metals, such as gold and silver, can be ascertained
merely from the external character of smell.                          Among the
antients, however, smell was a principal character of metals.
The finest compositions were distinguished merely by their
odour.        Arrian on Epictetus * fays expressly that an expert
money-changer (banker) must necessarily have the fense of
smelling in an exquisite degree.
                                                " Behold," says Epictetus,
"    in money affairs, when our interest is concerned, the art
which has been invented, and the means which the changer
 employs to try the money.                He tries them by the sight, Dy

    +   And why not by the taste ? to go through the whole circle of the
organs of fense.       This method was also known to the antients. The
use of the touchstone, lafiis Lydius (fee Theocritus, xii. 36; and Pliny,
xxxiii. 8. with observations by M. Schneider, AnalrBa ad Htfloriam Rei
Metailicte, p. 3.), was, however, the most common method of trying gold,
which when it had undergone this test was called obryxum.              Pliny speaks
also, in the place above quoted, of trials by fusion.           There is a curious
passage     in Herodotus,     vii. 10. respecting the true meaning wof which
mineralogists,      in my opinion,     have not yet agreed.      Artabanus said to
Xerxes before the Persians assembled, that pure gold could be distinguished
by rubbing it against other gold.          Wesseling, p. 312. 30. considers this
idea so absurd, that instead of lo rub (»af«Tpi4«M»») he prefers reading to
compare (ovynfimu).          Larcher, in his translation of Herodotus, vol. v.
p, 272, adopts, in part, the opinion of Wesseling on this passage : he fays
the word in the Greek text is m(aTfiJ,afivi.         But it is not by rubbing gqld
against gold that we can distinguish which is the best ;        I  do not therefore
hesitate to adopt the reading of Sancroft's manuscript, «n«» h mf« avyxft-
»»¦»!, which indicates the only manner of ascertaining pure gold before the
use of the touchstone was known.            I confess, however, that ira?«Tj4«v"»
has always appeared to me preferable, because rvyxnnm has the appear
ance of an interpolation,       and may have been substituted by some one who
did not understand the other word. My opinion is confirmed by C. Girod-
 Chamram, who, when consulted on this passage, declared that it might be
retained without any change, because, pure gold being softer than that al-
loved with copper, the least pure metal must make an impression on the
 other,    and thus afford the means of ascertaining it. The proof of this
 assertion   was established at the time when it was proposed to the National
Convention to coin new money in France without any alloy. The advan
 tages of this method were found to be counterbalanced by some inconve
 niences, one of which was, that friction is more destructive to pieces of
 pure metal than to those the hardness of which is increased by alloy—
                                                                                  Rap-
 fort far    Loysel,  Sept. 15,  1793.   The   National  Convention     charged     the
 Academy of Sciences to make experiments, which fully confirmed the

is not even contented with sounding it once or twice, and the
great attention he employs renders him a musician." However,
as the antienls generally employed the purest gold for coining
money *, it appears that the proof bv smelling did not relate
to pure gold and silver, but to the ignoble metals which might
have been mixed with them.        For all the passages of antient
authors which speak of the smell of metals                 f
                                                 all-.ide to an ar
tificial composition which could be distinguished by its odour.
It appears that it was in particular the composition so foolishly
sought after by the Romans, to which, byfwuy of preference,
they gave the name of Corinthian brafsj and which they
made use of for drinking-cups and their most valuable table
services.     We must no doubt rank amongthis number the
pretended vafa Iiiitiaca which Alexander the Great found
among the effects of Darius, and which being composed of
bronze brought from India could not be distinguished from
gold but by The smell J.
    I am acquainted with two other passages which this remark
may serve to explain.     Martial, in the 6oth epigram of his
ninth book, describes a swaggering fellow, who having a
great desire to purchase, but an empty purse, harassed the
toymen of the Campus Martins or Septum at Rome by al
ways cheapening and never buying.        The poet, besides other
           fays of him,  " He consults his nose respecting the
things,
itiK-lT of Corinthian brass §."
    Cicero, in his Paradoxes, speaks of the connoisseurs of his
time who purchased Corinthian bronzes with incredible avi
dity, and in examining them employed all their knowledge
in the arts.    He exhibits one of these haughty Romans in
the attitude of examining with great earnestness a night-
chair ot Corinthian brass || ; for night-chairs were made of
the most precious metals in those periods, when gold was
pcrienccil by pieces of fine silver in circulation compared with that of al
loyed silver would be nearlv in the ratio of 3 to j; aud that of pure gold
compared with alloyed gold would be as 7 to 3." — Rapport de Luvsrl, p. in.

would be, to know whether copper, mixed with other metals,
can really be disiinguistied by the smell. A late French tra
veller ascribes to the inhabitants of one of the Kamtschatdalc
isles so acute a smell, that they were able, he says, to distinguish
by it immediately copper alloyed with golds.            The second
would be, to know the nature of this alloy.
    The question respecting the manner in which the Corin
thian brass was mixed and fused with gold or silver, has never
vet been finally determined. Wicgleb %, and other chemists,
made experiments, by fusing some pieces of antient bronze;
but even if they could show with precision the manner of
mixing them, their experiments would still be doubtful, be
cause the antients were acquainted with several bronze mix
tures § ; and consequently, when they fused antient bronze,
they were not certain of its being Corinthian brass.

     Having thought it of importance              to give particular interest
to this paper,               by submitting it to some celebrated metallur
gist at Paris, I begged C. Gillet Laumont lo communicate
to me his ideas on the question proposed by M. Boettiger :
"  Whether copper, mixed with other metals, can be distin-
guissied by the smell, and to determine the nature of that
mixture."                   He   was    so    obliging      as        to give me the following
answer            :
     "Several metals have a smell which is peculiar to them :
that of iron, lead, tin, and in particular copper    may be di-                      \\,

       On   the   Agitations   of   the   Lake of Derwent Water.           163'
and less constant, there are certainly many emanations which
man cannot catch, or which would require a particular study
which it is seldom his interest to apply to.
    It is possible, also, that some persons, highly favoured by
nature, might acquire, by long habit, an exact knowledge of
the quantitv of copper that exists in any alloy; but it is cer
tain that these persons could not communicate to others at a
distance, or perhaps even present, the kind of sensations which
they experience, and frheir different modifications, according
to the nature and proportion of the mixtures.
   The means of distinguishing alloys, and the proportion of
alloys, by the help of smell, appear then to me to form a se
condary character, which ought not to be neglected, and
which, in certain individuals, may, by habit, be brought to
perfection, but which, as it cannot be easily communicated,
can never become an essential aud comparative character.
    It is possible that, in the time of Alexander, among the
means easily put in practice, that of smell was the surest for
distinguishing the Indian vales of bronze from those of gold.
    In regard to the passage of Herodotus, where it is said
"   that pure gold was distinguished by rubbing it against other
gold," it appears to me that the word vapaTp^^tv must be
retained, but the word again/I ought to be changed into by
the fide    of.  The passage then becomes clear, and only sup
poses the employment of           hard body proper for retaining
                                    a
the traces of these metals.       This explanation alludes to that
kind of proof still practised          our goldsmiths, with plates
                                          by
of metals alloyed in known proportions, which are called
test plates  ; but to be certain of their allay, they make use ot
a  touch-stone that  ;    to fay,

the alloys.

and as little understood by others as the moving of the waters
of the pool of Bethefda. — I mean the agitation of the lake of
Derwent water, and its floating islands.    Pennant fays, the
water of Derwent water is subject to violent agitations, ami
 often without any apparent cause, as was the cafe this day :
 the weather was calm, yet the waves ran a great height, and
 the boat was toiled violently with what the people in the neigh
 bourhood called a bottom wind. Dnlton fays, Darwcnl lake
 is agitated at certain times during a calm season, by some un
 known cause. Mr. Crossthwaitc has been afliduous in ob
 serving any circumstance that might lead to a discovery of
 the cause; but his result                is,
                                     that nothing has occurred yet to
 throw light on the subject.            He then gives various dates
 when the lake was disturbed; amongst the rest he fays,
         Aug. 9, 1789. The lake                      in

         Oct.       I792-   The  water much agitated.
      My   informant,    a boatman    of the name of Walker, fays he
  has frequented the lake for about 27 years, and heard of per
  haps 13 islands, though previous to that time for 20 years
  none had appeared.         One rose last vear, and two this year,
  which came up within two days of each other. The first
  rose the nth of September, and part sunk the 27th of the
  same month. Sometimes one comes up and                 down again in
                                                                 is
  24    hours,   and   sometimes    they   stay  two  months.    One of
  them  in    the vear 1798 was        80 yards long, 50 yards wide,
                                                l
  and staid at the top of the water six weeks.        One was pierced,
  and found seven yards thick.          They frequently burst, and are
  rent so wide, that boats can fail up and land passengers at the
  cd^es of them, to walk about on the island.           One was       foot    a
  high perpendicular         ofland above the level of the water.
  They are connected always            one fide to the grafsv turf at the
                                                by

                             is
   drawn out again, the air for several seconds bubbles up like
   a pot bulling violently        smell arises like gunpowder, and
                                  ;   a                                            it

                                      I                            part ofa
   which continued above the water, which gradually deepened
- all round    it, and found      of an oval shape, about ic yards
                                  it                                               by
   five yards.     The top was       sine sir/n mud, thick set with a
                                          a
   voung aquatic plant did not know. We puss.cd the boat-
                             I
   hook about four feet into it. The first part, about two feet,
    appeared all mud, then less firm, and full of partially-decayed
    leaves and roots of trees and plants; the water bubbled up for
                                                                              a   few

                       and its floating Islands.              165
 a few seconds about two inches high, occasioned by the air
  that followed the hook out.
    The riling of these islands is always accompanied with a
  bottom wind; vet the bottom wind appears frequently with
  out them ; raid generally after a month or six weeks of dry
  weather the lake is sometimes partially, sometimes wholly
 agitated, accompanied by a roaring noise (the probable ef
 fects of echo in a calm in that situation). The waves are not
long and rolling, but irregular shaped- like mountains, 20
 inches to two feet in height, Jike water jumbled in a tub ;
 they frequently strike the boat like a rock, and break in spray
 from head to hern, not always when it is perfectly calm, but
 also with a gentle breeze, barely enough to ripple the surface.
They frequently indicate a change of weather from fair to
rain, and the greatest degree of agitation is always in the
deepest water.
    Having thus minutely described all the particulars I have
time to collect, I (hall leave it to others to find a better ex
planation than the following.        When we consider that half
the bottom of the lake is covered with a sine mud impervious
to air, resting upon half-putrid vegetable matter; that being
attached to the Hoping banks, ali air that is generated will
endeavour to rife to the highest part, but cannot then get out ;
that great part of the bottom is a clean bed of pebbles and
stones pervious to air; that the islands begin to rife srcnerally
in from 9 to 12 feet water, and are of considerable surface;
 that thev have been measured 21 feet thick, with clear water
under them ; and that the most violent effects have been in
the summer months — Is it not probable that the air set at
liberty by putrefaction is enough to raise these larue masses,
so thick, and so little heavier than water itself; to contract
and expand their extremities enough to give the violent and
irregular motion to the superincumbent waters, by their
flowing oss, their reflux, and their breaking through —and that,
more or lei's, whether they rife to the suiface, or only part of
the way, to find their equilibrium in the surrounding fluid ?
Wishing our ignorance of the cause of this curiosity of our
own country may soon be removed, and wisliing success to
every investigation of the phænomena of nature, I will con

                XXX.    Description     of a nezv Hygrometer.
         SIR,                  To   Mr. Tillocb.
 I     HEREWITH           enclose a scheme for an hygrometer, which
  appears to me to be an improvement on the common (oat-
 beard) hygrometer in some respects, though, being more
  complex, it is more likely to be out of order. I have made se
  veral of them, and lind they act tolerably well.                Should you
  think   the invention worth noticing in your publication, you
  are   welcome     to make what use of the paper you think proper.
  Two other kinds of hygrometers 1 have also made, but they
  do not answer so well as I think, with some improvement,
  they might be made to do. In one the index moves under the
  spirals of a watch spring, by which the number of revolutions
  may be reckoned ; on account of the stiffness of the steel, the
   index does not move with freedom.                In the other the index
   moves between the coiis of a piece of paper cut in a spiral
   form, on which paper are figures marked to register the place
      # Communicated     by Mr. Robertson Buchannan,      engineer. Glasgow.

                      Description     of    a new Hygrometer.            ,             16/
it points  to.  Both these inventions                    are for the fame purpose
as the winding hygrometer, which                         is to avoid the confusion
occasioned by the oat-beard having                 more than one turn or
twist in its course from wet to dry.               I remain, Sir,
                                              Your very humble Servant,
                                                              B. M. FORSTER.
       Description        of   the   Jfinding       Oat-heard Hygrometer.
   The principal differences in this hygrometer from those
usually made of oat-beards arc the following:
   The graduated circle (Plate V. fig. 2.) is numbered com
pletely round, instead of half round ach way, as usual.          On
                            *
the top of the oat-beard      is cemented a circular piece of pa
per A, on which is fixed a tubular piece of straw B, which is
capped with another piece of paper C.          D is a support to
keep the beard upright, made of card paper.           On the straw
tube, or little cylinder, is fastened a piece of fine silken string,
on which     is hung a pea, to serve as a weight to keep the
string stretched.    As the oat-beard untwists with moisture,
the index (made of straw) moves the fame way round as
the hand of a watch, and, thus moving, coils the string round
the straw tube or axis; by which means the number of revo
lutions from any time observed may be known; and thus the
confusion will be avoided which is occasioned by the index
moving more than once round, which it does in passing from
extreme dryness to wet.
   The string mav be so placed as to wind up when the index
moves the contrary way, that                  is,
                                    from moist to dry,         the                if
maker      chooses; and in this cafe, the circle must be num
            so
bered the contrary way from the above.
   The oat-beard \s fixed, and the index         not to be turned
                                                             is
or- set to  certain
             a      point, as   the cafeiswith   the common                            hy
grometer, bv      contrivance
                      a       behind  the  cafe.
   The method of keeping register of this hygrometer will
                                       a
be thus     :
When        on the upper part          of   the axis there     is
One coil, and the index points at         set down  6, —             1       f>
Two coils           -                            6     — &c.         2       6,
   If the circle be divided into 100 divisions, the reckoning will
be,      No coil, and the hand at 10, set down 10
           coil
            1          -        -      10       -     110
           coils
            2            -      -      10       -     210, &c.
which,       the circle be large enough, will be
            if                                        very conve    a

XXXI.      Hijlorical  Sketch of the Institution and Progress of the
                      Royal Society of London.
                        [Continued from p. 38.]
E,    <VEN within a few years after its institution, the Socictv
 had acquired a considerable library, and a good collection of
natural curiosities. A Mr. Cohval was, in these things, one
of its first and most munificent benefactors.       Mr. Hooke, the
 first curator of the Society, had the care of the books and cu
riosities; and they were arranged according to a dafiisication
of all the species in nature, contrived by the famous Dr. Wil-
kins.       Mr. Ucnry Howard bestowed on the Society the
whole Arundelian library, consisting of some thdufands of
printed books, with several hundreds of choice manuscripts.
From the time, also, of the great sire, after which the build
ings of Greftiam-college were again occupied as an exchange,
Mr. Howard afforded the Society a place of temporary ac
commodation in Arundel house.
     Among the communications to this Society, within the first
seven years after its incorporation by charter, were many cu
rious theoretical discourses.       Such were an hypothesis of the
motions    of the  moon,   and   of   the fca; a theory of sire and
flame;    an  hypothesis   of  the   form  and spring of the air; a
discourse of the possible height of the air, and its rarefaction
upward; a discourse about improving wood for dyeing, and
for fixing colours; discourses upon several mercurial experi
ments; a discourse of annealing and tempering steel ; dis
courses about cyder and coffee; a discourse of the possibility
of the retardation of the motions of the heavenlv bodies, and
of their going flower and (lower the longer they last ; — with
a multitude of others, which it were inconvenient and tedious
here to enumerate in detail.
     As their views were more expressly and directly than those
of their present successors in the Royal Society to the improve
ment of the arts, they quickly formed aecurate histories of
many of the most useful of these. Among their papers, with
in the first seven years after the Society's institution, were to
be found, an history of Englisti mines and ores, two separate
histories of tinneries and tin-working, histories of iron-
making, of lignum foflile, of saffron, ofalkermes, ofverdi-
grease, of the bleaching of wax, of colours, of the making
of alum, of the preparation of salt from salt water, of ena
melling, of engraving, of varnishing, of dyeing, of refining
gold, of making potashes, &c.             The processes of making
                                                             bread.

           Hiflorlcal   Sketch   of   the   Injlilution , &c   169
bread, of making cloth, of tanning with the other parts of
the manufacture of leather, of paper-making, of hat-making,
of brewing, were accurately related according to the best
practice ot them at that time, in different memoirs by the
first members and correspondents of the Society. Prince Ru
pert communicated two papers of extraordinary value, ex
plaining the process for the manufacture of gunpowder, and
an improvement of that process, by which gunpowder might
be made which should have twenty times the strength of
that which was commonly in use.           Mr. Henshaw produced
to the Society an ingenious history of the discovery and the         \
manufacture of salt-petre. Many papers illustrative of the
history of the useful arts were communicated by Sir William
Petty, one of the most truly honourable founders to whom
any family among our British nobility can trace the origin of
its wealth and nobilitating distinctions.
    But none of all those original members did more than Dr.
 (afterwards Sir) Christopher Wren to advance the purposes
of the Institution.     He proposed certain curious theories of
motions, extending and correcting the doctrine of Des Cartes,
which, however they may have been since exploded, were
imagined with great ingenuity, and illustrated by a multitude
of happy experiments. He contrived to annex to a weather
cock an apparatus, which, of itself, registered for every twelve
hours the changes of the wind j and invented also a thermo
meter, to register for itself the variations in the temperature to
which it should be exposed.        He was the inventor of an in
strument for measuring the quantity of the rain that falls.
He was the first who explained, that from the pendulum
might be produced a natural standard of measure for vulgar
use.  He first exactly measured and delineated the spheres of
the humours in the eye ; and thence explained how reflection
conduces as much as refraction to vision. He was the first
author of the noble anatomical experiment of injecting liquors
into the veins of animals. He made a variety of experiments
to ascertain the powers of the magnet ; and many to explain
the nature of the powers by which sailing is performed, and
to fix what fabric of a ship might be molt suitable to the uses
for which it is intended. He made many improvements upon
telescopes, and a prodigious number of astronomical obferva-             ^>v
 tions, particularly on the planet Saturn, and on the moon.                    "',   *
    He invented   a curious and very speedy method of etching.             ^J^'
 He suggested number of contrivances for the improvement
              a
of water-works.      He found out certain perpetual lamps and
registers of furnaces,    by which artificial heat might be so
kept up and graduated as to imitate nature       the hatching of
                                                     in

chickens and infects, the vegetation of plants, the production
of certain     fossils, and the preservation of an equality in the
motions of watches, in order to the discovery of the longitude,
fee. AH these things he accomplished in a ddigent pursuit
of the objects of the Society: and as his discoveries were
made, he communicated them, hut with the greatest diffi
dence and modesty, at its meetings.
    And yet, even this variety, activity, and success in its re
searches, could not satisfy the tyrannical impatience of pub
lic expectation. The cavillers against the Society derided its
members as idle dreamers, or interested impostors, who ex
cited hopes which they could not gratify, and wasted their
 own lives and fortunes in pursuits having no rational attain
able end.        Others conceived prejudices (till stronger against
these studies ; accusing them as atheistical, and adverse to the
study of purely moral and intellectual truth ; because they
traced to second causes phenomena, which had been usually
 referred to the immediate agency of the Divine Power; and
 ¦withdrew attention front the logic, ethics, and theology,
 which had hitherto reigned in the schools.            By others they
 were abhorred as incapable of alliance with elegance and
 grace, with the charms of poetry and eloquence, with the re
 finement of the language, or the improvement of the popular
 parts of literary composition.       To many that tolerance was
 extremely odious with which they received all men of in
 genious inquiry into their correspondence, without distinction
 of nation or religion ; and the admirers of the ages of classical
 antiquity derided, with the proudest contempt, the very idea
 upon which the Institution was founded, — that it was postible
  to extend the empire of human knowledge beyond those limits
 within which the antients had left it confined.
     The Society, not unmoved by such censures and com
  plaints, yet not diverted by them from the prosecution of its
  views, advauced, though slowlv, yet with steady and vigorous
  diligence, in its experiments and inquiries. Dr. Spratt's apo-
  logetical history contributed to silence many prejudices. The
  imitation of the design of this Society, by so many similar in
  stitutions arising alter it in foreign countries, evinced the ge
  neral conviction of mankind to be in its favour. Its memoirs
  and transactions were, from time to time, printed ; and,
  among discoveries and inquiries which could interest none
  but philosophers, failed not to contain, likewise, others of
  general utility and importance so striking and palpable, that
  even the attention and approbation of the vulgar could not be.
  refused.
      In  pure   mathematics, the successive publications       of the
                                                              Society,

          and Progress  of the Royal  Society of Tendon.       tyi
Society, to the end of the seventeenth century, exhibited a
variety of inventions exalting the power of that science, and
furnishing it with new arms to triumph over difficulties of
investigation to which it was before unequal. The discoveries
of Newton had been prompted by that spirit of mathematical
and physical research which the institution of the Society ex
cited. Their communication did honour to the meetings of
the philosophers, and enriched their volumes.       Wallis, Gre
gory, De Moivre, and Halley soon communicated a number
of valuable problems, theorems, and new demonstrations,
important both in the new display of beautiful, and in their
susceptibility of application to the improvement of the mathe
matical arts.     In mixed mathematics the optical discoveries
of Newton, Hevelius, aud Iluygens were, in great part,
made first known to the world through the medium ot the
Royal Society. Leeu wen hock and the illustrious Dr. Robert
 Hookc published molt of their microscopical discoveries, in
 the first instance, through the fame channel.       A multitude
of the most important observations in astronomy, the com
 munications chiefly of Flamsteed, Hevelius, Caffini, Ilallcv,
 Gregory, Bullialdus, Auzout, fill the early volumes of these
 Transactions. Bernoulli, Iluygens, Hooke, and Wallis com
 municated some highly curious papers in mechanics and
acoustics. Mr. Boyle, M. Homberg, Dr. Papin, Dr. Rei-
selius, and an inferior philosophical society at Oxford, com
 municated various experiments on the gravities of different
 fluids, their superficial figures, and their laws of movement.
 Mr. Thomas Savcry, in the year 1699, made known to them
 an engine of his invention for raising water bv steam.
     Flamsteed, Borelli, Halley, Mercator, Caffini, Bullialdus,
and Greaves, gave, for the improvement of geography and
navigation, many observations of the longitudes and latitudes
 of different places, of the variations of the compass, &c. &c.
     In architecture and (hip-building, their Transactions ex
 hibit the valuable papers of Lcciuvcnhoek " on the differences
 in timber as it grows in different countries, and is felled in
 different seasons ;" of Mr. Bulteel " on the slieathing of ships
 with lead;" of Dr. Lister, Dr. T. Robinson, and Dr. Wallis,
 "   on bridges, arches, and chimneys, 8cc."       Wallis andSal-
  vetli communicated some interesting papers on the theory of
  music. Dr. Sherard gave a receipt for making china varnishes.
     In physiology, meteorology and pneumatics, the      researches
  of tins Society in the last thirty years of the        feventeeth
  century were no less diligent and meritorious. The baro
 meter, the hygrometer, the thermometer, were first put to
  important use in philosophical observation by its members.

  IJZ              Hijlorical  Sketch  of the Institution ,
 The    general phænomena of the weather in different seasons
 and latitudes were by them first recorded with philosophical
 accuracy. Of the winds, rains, snow, hail, lightning, thunder,
 meteors, exhalations, their papers exhibit an assemblage of
 facts, to which much has indeed been since added, but which
 still form a large and important part of our present science of
 atmospherical phænomcna.            They collected a prodigious
 variety of observations to illustrate the physical history of
 •water, as it existed in seas, lakes, springs,     mineral and salt-
 springs,  &c,  ; and  to explain  the manufacture of salt from sea
 water or from that of salt-springs.
     In those early volumes are a very great number of papers
 in mineralogy : the facts which they contain laid the foun
dation of this science.     The history, in particular, of animal
 substances, and of vegetables found in a fossil state ; of some
volcanic eruptions ; of marble sound in Ireland ; of the forma
tion ol peat -earth in Scotland; of the strata of pit-coal; of
rock crystal, iron, and copper-ore ; of amber; of the electrical
capacities of amber, gum lac, and diamonds ; was illustrated
in a number of curious papers, the produce of much laborious
inquiry, and of many observations made with the srreatest
diligence.     Mr, Gill, Sir Robert Moray, Dr. Brown, and
others, communicated interesting papers on damps in mines.
Dr. Lister gave some mineral maps, and an account of the
 true way or making steel.        A catalogue of electrical bodies
was received from Dr. Robert Plot: Mr. D. Colwal favoured
the Society with accounts of alum works and green copperas
works.      The lead mines in Someisetsliire, the quicksilver
mines in Friuli, the silver and gold mines in Hungary, were
made particularly known to the Society by communications
from Mr. Glanville, Dr. W. Pope, and Dr. E. Brown.                 A
curious paper from Mr. M. Septalius acquainted them with
the existence of mercury in certain plants. The collection of
their papers presents, beside these, a prodigious variety of
other information relative to subjects in the mineral kingdom.
    The power of the magnet ; the use of the magnetic needle f
the declination of the needle, its variations in different places,
with the theory of those variations, engaged much of the
Society's attention, and were very ably illustrated by the papers
of Dr. Halley, Mr. Hevelius, Mr. Auzout, Mr. Cunningham,
and others.
    To the improvement of the science of botany, and the
practice of agriculture, they continued to devote much'of their
care.     Rye, turnips, potatoes, maize, saffron, orange-trees,
vines, arc among the plants whose culture and (Economical
uses were successfully explained in the papers read before
                                                                this

tion, the circulation and descent of the sap in trees, the re
union of bark to trees from which it had been separated, &c.
 were sinelv explained bv Dr. Beale, Dr. Lister, Mr. Reed,
M. Malphisti, Mr. Kay, &c. The use of marie, of sea-sand,
 of salt and of brine forcianures, are taught in others of those
             Mr. King communicated a method of improving the
 Eapers.
   oirs  and    loughs in Ireland by drainage.                Dr. Beale ex
 plained     tne  fertilizing powers      of frost.     The   preparation of
 oak for tanning, of sugar from the maple-tree, of vinegar, of
 pitch, tar, resin, and turpentine, are the subjects of some other
 ingenious papers of the fame period. Dr. Lister investigated
 with curious pains the botanical history of the mushroom.
 Hemlock, opium, snake-root, aloe americana, the amomum
 of the Philippine isles, and many other plants adapted to be
 of use in the materia inedica, were examined in their growth
  and qualities, under the Society's directions. Dr. Lister proved
 the possibility 0/ fertilizing a sandy soil by the addition of
  clay. Sir Robert Moray gave a valuable paper on the process
  of malting. Dr. Beale and Mr. Dale taught how to mak»
                                              '
  bread from turnips and potatoes.
      In zoology, the papers of this period are likewise nume
  rous, and illustrative of many of the most interesting species
  in the animal kingdom.             The histories of the silkworm, the
  whale, the cochineal insect, the pearl-muscle, the bee, were,
  on account of the relations of these animals to the useful
  arts, examined with extraordinary care.                   Many accounts
  of monstrous births, and figures of animals, were from
  different parts transmitted for the Society's consideration.
   Waller's poem " on the Summer Islands" appears to have
   had for its foundation a narrative concerning whales and
   whale-sistiing at the Bermudas, which was communicated to
   the public in the Transactions of the Royal Society.                   Mr.
   Ray, examining into the nature of ants, discovered and made,
   known to the Society that which has been since named the
  formic acid. Others, with much curious pains, illustrated
   the history of the spider.          Dr. Lister sound an acid juice in
   another insect      beside    the   ant.  Mr. Boyle and others exa
   mined and explained          the   anatomical    structure of fishes.     In
    regard  to  the human     body especially     were    these philosophers
    wonderfully industrious in research.             The natural accidents
    to which it is subject, and its anatomical structure, were
    never before so well illustrated as by the facts which they
    collected. Concerning the structure, external parts, and
    common teguments of human bodies; the head ; the neck
    aud thorax ; the abdomen ; the humours and general affec
                                                                          tions

     174            Hiftorical     Sketch of the Institution
    tions of the body   ;  its bones, joints;     their Transactions pre
    sent an assemblage of facts such as must,         in comparison, put
    to (hame the industry of later anatomists.
       In chemistry, they investigated the nature and composition
    of phosphorus, of the Bologna stone, of vegetable and mi
   neral acids, &c.       An engine to consume smoke was made
   known to them by M. Justel.             A method of imitating the
   pottery of China appears also among their papers.              Sir Ro
   bert Southwell communicated an account of the method of
   dressing buck and doe skins, which was practised by the
   Caribbees in the West Indies. The phosphorescent qualities
   of wood, putrid flesh, the surface of the sea, &c. were par
   ticularly examined in papers communicated by Mr. Boyle
   and   Dr. Beale.
       Nor were their     endeavours confined to the improvement
   merely of physical and mathematical science.             Mr. Lodwick
  gave an essay towards an universal alphabet.             Dr. Wallis in
   vented a method of teaching persons deaf and dumb to speak
   and understand language.           Mr. Edward Lloyd communi
  cated some valuable observations             in philological science.
  Another gentleman gave a paper of highly curious observa
  tions ana conjectures concerning the Chinese characters.
  The collection of their papers affords likewise some valuable
  illustrations of difficulties in chronology.         Roman, Grecian,
  Saxon, Runic, Egyptian, and Persian antiquities have also
  a variety of new lights thrown upon them in these papers.
  The first account of the discovery of the famous ruins of Pal
 myra appears here in two communications from Mr. Timothy
 Landy and Mr. Aaron Goodyear. When the members and
 correspondents      of the Society were engaged in journeys and
 voyages, they      never    failed to register for its informaflon at
 least some, of the more extraordinary facts which came under
 their notice. And a number of its papers are, in consequence
 of this, narratives of such observations, interesting in the
 highest degree at once to philosophers and to mere popular
 curiosity.
      Yet about the beginning of the 18th century the members
of the Societv were themselves dissatisfied with the progress
and success of their efforts.        They began to feel that their first
ardour of inquiry had become cool.               They complained, that
" the discouraging neglect of the great, the impetuous contra
diction of the ignorant, and the reproaches of the unreason
able, had unhappily thwarted them in their design to perpe
tuate a succession of useful inventions." Nor was it to have been
expected that the fears for .religion and liberty in the latter
part of the reign of Charles the Second.and his successor, the
                                                                    civil

           and Progress of the Royal Society    of London.      375
civil and political contentions to which they gave birth, and
the direction of lo much of the learned ability of the time,
to exercise in the field of the popish controversy, should not
have proved inauspicious to the advancement of philosophical
studies.     The reign of William, harassed with wars, with
disputes    relative   to the rights of the reigning sovereign and
to the royal succession, with factions in church and state,
introduced no new fortunate æra for the advancement of phi
losophy and the arts.          Even in the beginning of the 18th
century, and during the course of some years, the fame dis
 sensions and wars continued to produce the fame effects upon
the fortune of science.         The wits presumed to throw ridicule
upon     science   and  erudition, which they were too idle to cul
tivate.     The reijvn of Anne was for England perhaps the
 golden age of wit and elegant literature ; and men mowed
 themselves sufficiently disposed to prefer the light and shinina-,
to that which was only solid and unostentatious.
     Yet, while Newton, the pride of the Royal Society, di
 stinguished himself among its active members, or presided at
 its meetings, it could not but continue to be regarded as the
grand focus of physico-mathematical discovery and know
ledge.      His own communications in optics, astronomy, and
general physics, were invaluable.         His system of the universe
 was adopted as one which was infallibly true, and which it
 was for the honour of the nation, by all possible means, to
illustrate and maintain. Hence, from the commencement till
 nearly the middle of the 1 8th century, the labours of the So
 ciety were principally employed in pursuing the analogies of
 the Newtonian system throughout all that diversity of plue-
 nomena by which its certainty was to be tried. Such wer^
 almost all the experiments, observations, and theories, of the
 illustrious, the indefatigable Hallcy. Desagulier, Facio, Keill,
 and Maclaurin, successfully laboured in the fame field. Every
 other branch of those sciences which the Society studied espe
 cially to improve, continued also to be more or less advanced
 by the labours of its members.
     It was at length evident that the field which its founders
 had, with noble ambition, marked out for themselves was too
 vast.    The Socie^ of Arts arose by perhaps an unconscious
 derivation from the Roval Society.           To the latter was (till
 left the province of the f'ublimer and abstrustr sciences. The
 latter, with admirable national enthusiasm, undertook the task
 of applying, and encouraging the application of, scientific
 truth to the improvement of the common arts.
     Fora time, about the middle of the iSth century, when
 the Newtonian system was fully established, and no new
                                                                path

 path of noble discover)' had been opened,          the exertions
of   these philosophers might comparatively languish.         The
 discoveries of Dr. Stephen Hales concerning the diversities of
airs, about that time, however, renewed the truths which had
been first explained by Hooke.      Discoveries in natural history
and chemistry were continually more and more multiplied.
Franklin at length communicated to the Society the grand
truth of the identity of lightning with electricity, and a new
theory combining all the electrical phenomena which had
been as yet observed. Priestley, following Hales, Hooke, and
Boyle, in experiments upon air, discovered all the varieties of
aeriform substance.    Cavendish, Kir wan, and others, exa
mined airs in their relations to the calces of metals, &c. Sir
Joseph Banks has done high honour to the Society by the ad
vancement which it has, under his auspices, made in botani
cal discovery, and in the culture of the other branches of na
tural historv. At the present time, its labours are, in all the
branches ot physical and mathematical science, most zealously
continued. Amid so many rival institutions the Royal Society
of London holds still the first place.   Its memoirs, now with
great regularity annually published, fully vindicate its claim
to the highest estimation of the public.      We have reviewed
its history with a conscious pride that we are of the fame
country and language with a succession os philosophers who
have discovered, or collected and arranged, the better part of
the physical knowledge peculiar to modern times. He who
would aspire to the praise of a philosopher would do well to
study the volumes of its Transactions with peculiar care.

   In this lecture the author offers no new experiments, a
sufficient number for his purpose having been made and re
corded bv preceding philosophers, on which he rests four hypo
theses : The first   is,that luminiferous Æther, of an extreme
                            a
degree  of rarity, pervades the universe the second, that, when

 bodies become luminous, undulations are excited in this
 æther— The third, that colours are owing to vibrations
 in this æther acting on the retina — and the fourth, that all
 matter attracts this æther; and that, when bodies are lumi
nous, it acts in a more dense, though not in a more elastic
 state upon them.
    In the meeting on the 26th was read an analysis of a mi
 neral from North America, which contains a metal different
 from any hitherto known : by Charles Hatchet, Esc).
    This is an acidisiable metal, but differs in some respects from
those acidisiable metals already known.         A vivid orange-co
loured precipitate can be thrown down from one of its solu
tions, which, as it remains unchanged after being exposed to
air and light, will be a most valuable acquisition to artists.
By another process a green precipitate is obtained.
    It is proposed to give this metal the name of Columbium.
The specimen from part of which this analysis was made is
 in the British Musæum ; but Mr. Hatchet is in hopes of
being able to obtain a fresh supply from America.

        Notice of  the labours of the Class of the Mathematical and
    Physical  Sciences   during the last three months of the year 9.
                               Mathematics.
        C. Delambre read the following account of the mathema
   tical labours :
        A memoir on the equilibrium of arches, by C. Bossut, was
   read.     As the stones which compose an arch mutually coun
   terbalance each other, they remain suspended without any
   support from below, all their effort being directed towards
   the abutments, which support the arch, as if it formed one
   continued body.
       To ensure the duration of an arch, it is not sufficient that
   all the stones should be in equilibrium ; the abutments on
   which they rest must oppose a sufficient resistance to the
   efforts the arch makes to overturn or crusti them.
       A research into the means proper for preventing their being
  overturned constitutes what is called the problem of the pum
  of arches, which* eng»ged the attention of several geome
  tricians of the last century ; but they entirely neglected that
  problem which has for its object the means of preventing
   crushing.
       To try the resistance of which different stones are suscepti
  ble, Soufflet invented a machine, which was afterwards im
  proved by C. Rondelct.
       The antients had no very certain or geometrical principles
  for insuring the solidity of their edifices; at least, no trace of
  them is seen in the work of Vitruvius, nor is any thing found
  in that work on the figure of the stones or on that of the
• wood ; which induces C. Boffut to think that their archi
  tects, attending merely to decoration and external form, left
  to the builders what related to the construction and solidity,
                                  M   2                           in

in,   which, nnfortunately,   they have   had   too many imttatarf
among the moderns.
      La Hire was the first, at least in France, who determined,
 by the theory of the wedge, the proportion according to
 which the weight, of. the arch stones ought to be augmented
 in a semi-circular arch.
      In 1704, Parent determined by points the figure of the
 extrados of an arch the intrados of which is a Temi-circle.
 He determined also the push of such an arch on the abut
  ments.
      James and John Bernoulli, Huygcns, and Leibnitz, having
  resolved the problem of the catenarian curve, it was loon per
  ceived that this curve was that of the equilibrium for an arch
  composed of arched stones infinitely small and equally heavy.
  David Gregory (bowed this fact, and it is deduced (till more
  directly from a method given by James Bernoulli.         A second
  method of the same author, corrected by C. Bofiut, conducts
  to the fame conclusion.
       La Hire in 1712 gave a method, sounded on some experi
  ments, which, on account of its great facility, was adopted
  by practical workmen, who gave themselves no trouble to
   inquire whether it was applicable to all cafes.     Not content
   with following it in semi-circular arches, they applied it even
   to domes, though the equation of the equilibrium in this
   cafe is of the third degree, and not of the second, as in the
   preceding cafe.
       Couplet has treated of the push of semi-circular arches,
   and of the thickness of their abutment? ; first, bv considering
   the arch stones as infinitely smooth, and experiencing no re
   sistance from friction; and then he endeavours         to correct
   what may be defective in this supposition : but he does not
    go further than Parent and La Hire.
        Bouguer has treated of domes.       He has shown that a va
    riety of curves may be employed in them, and of thele he
            out those most advantageous.      But he has not calcu
     ated the push, nor has he examined the law of the force*
    fioints
    which must act on the arch (tones when the generating curve
    is subjected to given conditions; a subject fertile in curious
    and useful problems. '
        In 1770 C. Bossut undertook to treat of the question in its
    whole extent, both in regard to semi-circular arches and
    domes. He examined every thing that relates to the form
    and push of arches.    His memoirs were printed in the Trans
    actions of the Academy of Sciences for the years 1774 and
     1776.

    Mascheroni, who was deputed by the Cisalpine republic
 t<> assist in fixing the unity of the new measures, and of whom
 the sciences were deprived last year, made in 1785 new re
 searches, and gave some ingenious propositions respecting the
 equilibrium of domes with circular elliptical ana polygonal
  bases.
    After many new reflections and several experiments, which
may be of the greatest use in practice, C. Bossut has resumed
 his two memoirs, which he has thrown into one, simplifying
 his calculations in several places.       He has made a great many
additions both in theory and practice, so that the whole now
 forms a work which may be considered as new.
                                  Comet,
    C. Meissier read a note on the comet which he discovered
on the 1 2th of July last, about half after 11 in the evening.
 It had a very faint light: in 41 minutes time it had 24' 40"
direct motion in right ascension, and 6' 38" in northern de
clination decreasing.         The same comet was seen the same
day,    and   almost  at  the  same instant, by Mechain and Bou-
vard ; and the latter observed it on the meridian at 11 h. 57'
49" true time.          Its right ascension was m° 15', and its
northentvdeclination 69 30'.
    It has since been known that it was observed the same day
 at Marseilles by C. Pons, who had even seen it the day be
 fore.     But the clouds did not then permit him to ascertain,
 by regular observations,       whether it was a comet or only a
ncbulus.        Mechain has calculated its elements.
    Observation    of  the Summer    Sol/lice of the Year 9 (1801),
    Duc-la-Chapelle, associate, has communicated to us the
result of the observations he made at Montauban,             to deter
mine the solstitial altitude of the sun and the obliquity of the
bcliptic.
    By the mean of nine days observations he found the appa
rent obliquity to be 23 2&." 9", supposing the semi-diameter
of the sun 15' 48, ', and the latitude of his observatory 440
    J hese observations were made with Lacaille's sextant ; and
it would     perhaps be proper to. take from the tables of that
astronomer the diameter of the tin and the refractions which
he determined with the fame instrument, because these tablea
contain also the errors of that sextant.           By these means the
observations of Duc-la-Chapelle would agree with ours. By
a mean of eighteen days observations, made with Borda'a
circle, I found the obliquity to be 23° 38' $"4,             Mechain
                                   M  3                           and

and Le Frangois found the seconds to be only from 6 to 7.
It is exceedingly difficult to avoid these small differences.
Uniting my observations for three years, I find, by taking
a mean, that the apparent obliquity at the summer solstice of
the year 8 (1800) was 2s 28' 6"4, or 230 27' 58" for the
mean obliquity.         The observations of Bradley, Mayer, La-
caille, and Le Gentil, gave nearly 230 28' 18" for 1750; it
would thence result that the secular diminution is only 40"
instead of the 50" which are generally supposed. A part of the
difference may arise from the observations, and particularly
the old observations, which perhaps ought to be examined
with the more correct elements which are employed at
present.
Remarks on the Fifty Thousand Stars, the Observations           of
               •which have been published by Lalande.
    Lalande has announced, in the preface to his Histoire Ce-
lejle, that there are in the heavens a great many vacant
spaces, many changing stars, and many red stars.           He has
now given further details respecting these objects in a memoir
accompanied with tables.           By vacant spaces Lalande here
understands spaces in which no stars are seen of the ninth
magnitude, which are the smallest that can be perceived with
an achromatic telescope of sixty-seven millimetres aperture
 (about %\ inches) for illuminating the object-glass that the
threads may be seen.         It is beyond all doubt, that, by ex
 cluding   all  foreign light, and employing the strongest magni
 fying glasses, these vacant spaces, properly so called, would
 be found to be considerably diminished in number; and per-
 hips there is not in the whole heavens a single place to which
 a telescope could be pointed without seeing a great number
 of stars, but below the ninth magnitude, and consequently
 too faint to be of any use in astronomy.
    Lalande gives a catalogue of all these vacant spaces ; that
 is to fay, his table contains the right ascension and declina
 tion of the centre os each os these (paces.
    The changing stars are contained in a second table, and
 are in number thirty-one.         There are only twelve the pe
 riods of which are known, but there are several others which
 decrease in magnitude so as to disappear at intervals.        By
 attentive observation, the time which elapses between two
 consecutive      disappearances   might be determined ; and this
 kind of observation Lalande recommends to the curiosity of
 those who, beimr possessed of onlv moderate instruments, may,
 however, be dcsiVous of being useful to astronomy.
    The third table contains thirty-three stars of a red colour.

  About ihe year 1756 Maver had remarked this tint in the
  nineteenth of pisces, which he denotes in the register of his
  observations by the epithet of rubictinda, as we have seen by
  the copy sent to us by M. Lichlemberg of all the observations
  made by Mayer on the day on which ha observed the planet
  ofHerschel. Michell and Bailli suppose that the colour of
  the stars may depend on the different intensity of their fire,
  or the degree of their inflammation ; and that the red colour
  may indicate     a   fire decreasing.     Under this idea it might be
  of importance       to examine       the changes of colour which the
  stars experience.        However, these variations, if they exist,
  are doubtless exceedingly flow; for the different sliades at
  present  remarked        between     Antares,   Arcturus, Aldebaran,
  Syrius,  and the      Lyre,   existed in the time  of Ptolemy.
  Extratl from     a  Memoir on the Degree of Magnetism acquired
     by Bars of    Steel   of different Thickness, <nd on some Results
     in regard   to  the Magnetic Needle, by C. Coulomb.
     Almost all the magnetic phænomena can be subjected to
 calculation if we suppose in steel two magnetic fluids, in each
 of which the moleeulæ repel each other in the inverse ratio
 of the squares of the distances, and attract in the fame ratio
 the particles of the other fluid.            This law was proved by-
 Coulomb in the Memoirs of the .Academy for 1786, from
 experiments which appear decisive.
     When steel is in its natural state, and not magnetized, the
 two fluids are neutralized by each other; that is to fay, they
 keep each other mutually in equilibrium, and no longer exer
 cise anv action, since one of the fluids attracts a magnetic
 molecula with the fame force as the other repels it.
     When the fluids are separated they tend to unite and to
 neutralize each other; and thev would indeed unite were
 there not a coercive force which opposes this union.             This
force may be either the adhesion of the moleeulæ of the fluid
to the steel, or the friction which they experience in pasting
from one point to another.
    The author has proved (Mcmoires de V Academie 1787,
p. 491) that whether the two fluids were separated and car
 ried each to an extremity of the bar, or whether they were
only displaced in each molecula of the steel without the power
of pasting from one molecula to another, calculation gave the
same result.       He has proved at the fame time that the latter
supposition   is  the   only one which can agree with experience.
    According to these suppositions, a bar of steel may acquire
every degree of magnetism, provided that there is no point in
it w here the result of the action of ail the moleeulæ of the
                                     JNJ 4                        fluid

184                French National Institute.
fluid of the bar which act on the magnetic fluid of that point,
is greater than the cohesion which prevents it from being dis
placed.
    But among all the degrees of magnetism there is one which
may be called the point of saturation, or the maximum of
magnetism ; it is that where the result of the forces on each
molecula is precisely equal to the adhesion of that molecula
to the steel.  It may be readily conceived that when it attains
 to this state the bar has the highest degree of magnetism
which it can acquire; it is also that degree which ought to
be given to bars destined for making needles to the manner's
compass.
    To know whether a needle be magnetized to saturation,prac-
tice seems to furnish but one method, which         is,
                                                      to magnetize
it  with bars of different strength. If l>ar, for example, be
                                          a
successively magnetized with bars the force of which               as is
I  to 2, and if the bar the first time has the fame directive force
as when magnetized with the strongest magnets,                  it
                                                             appears
that we may thence conclude, with         a  great deal of proba
bility, that the bar   is
                         magnetized to saturation. Theory fur
nishes us with    a  more direct method, which            is,
                                                          to find          by
calculation what may be the directing force of bar mag       a
netized to saturation, and to examine whether the result of
this calculation be agreeable to experience.            was in this
                                                        It
manner that Coulomb proved, in the third volume of the
Memoirs of the Institute, p. 176, that        if two bars of steel,
all the fides of which are homologous, that         to fay, the cor
                                                   is
responding sides of which are in the fame ratio, be compared
with each other, these bars, suspended horizontally as the
needles of   a compass, will have the momenta of their direct
ing forces as the cube of one of their dimensions. This re
sult perfectly agrees with what has been found                   by
                                                              experi
 ment; which affords        new confirmation of the theory.
                            a                                          ,
     In the present memoir the author endeavours to determine
 the magnetic state of several bars united in succession one
 above the other, or, what amounts to the fame thing, to de
 termine the force osdifferent bars in regard to their thickness.
     Butit  may be easily conceived that,     ifthe theory adopted
is   agreeable to nature, when two bars of great breadth, and
 very thin, are magnetized to saturation, each point magnet
 ized, in the two bars united, will experience, on the part of
 these two bars, an action almost double to that which the
 fame point would experience    if   each bar magnetized to satu
  ration were insulated. Thus,       byuniting the two bars, each
 of them ought to retain only little more than half the mag

the same for two bars as for one. This, indeed, the author
proved by taking two bars of a white temper of 80 milli
metres (3,14960 inches) in length, a third of a milli
metre (o'oi3ia inch) in thickness, and forty millimetres
 (1,57480 inch) in breadth. Experience showed that the ratio
of the momentum of the directing force of one insulated bar
to that of the fame bar united, is as 185 to 100, or nearly,
as may be seen, the ratio of 2 to 1.
   But it may be readily conceived that, in proportion as bars
have more thickness and less breadth, as the fluid condenses
itself in the edges and angles to which it is impelled in one
direction without experiencing reaction, it must then happen
that this ratio will be diminished. In this respect, experience
gave a result of great importance to practice.       It is a ratio
almost constant; so that, isa bar a millimetre (0*03937 inch)
in thickness be joined to another of the fame thickness; if these
 two bars be maguetized to saturation separately, and if they
 be then magnetized together united, the ratio of the mo
mentum of their directing forces in these two cases will be
 very nearly as 165 to 100.
    This ratio takes place also, as theory indicates, and as is
 confirmed by experience, whether the bars be hardened of a
 white temper, or whether they be tempered to the fame de
 gree of spring, provided they are compared in the same state
of temper  and hardness.
     It
     must however be remarked, that either by the method
by which we magnetize, or some other property of the mag
netic fluid which theory has not yet appreciated, when a bar
very long compared with its other dimensions is magnetized,
the whole fluid proceeds towards its extremities ia an extent
so  much narrower as the breadth and thickness of the bar are
less, and as the degree of temper is greater.      Between these
two parts there is an interval which gives scarcely any sign of
magnetism; whence it happens, that by joining two very long
bars the preceding law cannot have place, because the action
of the magnetism of the two bars united only causes the mag
netic fluid to flow back into the parts which gave no sign of
magnetism when each needle was insulated.
   It is onlv with needles then which give signs of magnetism
throughout their whole length that we ought to find an agree
ment between experience and theory.          It is always found,
for example, that if the directive force of an insulated bar of
two hundred millimetres (7,87400 inches) in length, what
ever may be its other dimensions, is to the directive force of
the fame bar, when united with one equal to          it,
                                                       as 165 to
 100  ; all shorter bars will give the fame result, and all bun

dies   formed of such bars will give, in regard to a bundle
double in thickness, the fame result.
    Theory indicates also, that when a bar is compared with
itself in different states, whatever may be its dimensions, if
it be magnetized to saturation, its directive force ought to
be augmented with the coercive force which keeps the mag
 netic fluids separated. But as this coercive force is constant for
                                                      results, that whatever may

 those brought down to a white temper, the

 impossible     to   ensure     the    same    degree    of   tempering.
     In steel of inferior quality there is still more advantage in

    C. Cuvier,   secretary,  read the following notice  :
On the Gas obtained from the Reduction of the Oxide        of Zinc,
                    and the Nature of Charcoal.
    The aeriform fluid obtained by reducing the oxide of zinc
by charcoal was stated by C. Gnyton to be a gaseous oxide
of carbon, that is to lay, carbonic acid with excess of base.
 Continuing to reason on this hypothesis, Guyton thought
 that the substance found there in excess, being very much,
divided and weakly retained, ought to be very much disposed
 to exercise its affinities, and that it could operate reductions
 cold and in the wet way. Trials, however, made with solu
 tions of lead, mercury, and silver, did not answer his expecta
 tion.   The gas experienced no alteration in these liquors;
but when put in contact with oxygenated muriatic acid there
was a spontaneous combustion, aud the gas, converted into
common carbonic acid by the accession of the oxygen of the
muriatic acid, became capable of precipitating lime water.
    Berthollet had a peculiar opinion in regard to the manner
 in which this reduction of the oxide of zinc takes place, and
 which he explained by the composition of common charcoal,
 which contains a large quantity of hydrogen.
    This doctrine he has endeavoured to establish by a very
 extensive dissertation on the nature of charcoal, and the dif
 ferent products thence obtained.
    For this purpose he resumed all the labours of his prede
 cessors on charcoal, and subjected them to a new examina
 tion. He has shown that Lavoisier was not altogether exact
 in his analysis of the carbonic acid, because at that period
 he was not well acquainted with the specific gravity of oxygen
 gas, and because he did not pay attention to the water, of
 which the carbonic acid alwavs contains a great deal. He
 brings forward the proofs which C. Monge gave of thisJast-
 mentioned fact, and has establistied, that common charcoal
 contains a large quantity of hydrogen and a little oxygen.
 He has shown that this charcoal distilled in a pneumato-
 chcmical apparatus gives carbonated hydrogen gas only as
                                                               long

 1 88               French National Lijlilute,
long as its oxygen is not exhausted, because a little of the
latter substance is necessary to produce that gas, which con
sequently is a ternary combination.     The rehduum then con
tains only carbon and a less quantity of hydrogen than,
simple heat can deprive it of; and the diamond, according
to Berthollet, differs from calcined charcoal only by its not
containing hydrogen, and not, as Guyton thought, because
the charcoal already contains oxygen.
    In regard to the different combinations which contain
hydrogen and carbon, Berthollet divides them into two
classes : the ternary, which contain oxygen, also such as the
gas extricated from sugar, that obtained from metallic oxides
with charcoal, and that which carbonate of barytes produces
with the fame substance, Jkc; and the binary, which contain
no oxygen, as the gas known under the name of olefying,
that extracted from alcohol and oil, and, in all probability,
that arising from the decomposition of water by charcoal.
His method to determine whether gas contains oxygen or not,
is simple and ingenious.      It consists in general in burning
the gas, and observing whether the oxygen it has consumed
during its combustion has been sufficient to produce the
results.    In the contrary cafe, the gas burnt must have al
ready contained a greater or less quantity of it.
    Berthollet has examined also the composition of the car
bonic acid, not by a direct method, but by admitting as true
the proportion which best corresponded to all the experiments
which his researches required,       ioo cubic inches of thU
acid contain, according to Berthollet, 84 cubic inches or 43
grains of oxygen, 16 grains of carbon^ anij from 9 to 10 grains
of water.
    In regard to the question which gave rife to all this labour,
Berthollet considers the gas resulting from the reduction of
zinc, as a ternary compound of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen,
in the proportion of two parts of hydrogen, seven parts of
carbon, and thirty-two of oxygen.
    While the French chemists were discussing this question
with so much activity, it engaged the attention of foreigners
also.    Mr. Cruickstiank gave to the gas obtained the fame
name as Guyton, viz. oxide of carbon.          He however saw
water formed in all his experiments except one, where, by the
nature of the substances employed, no more ought to have
been produced than just as much as the carbonic acid pro
duced at the fame time could absorb : thus the results of the
English chemist were, at bottom, the same as the last made
by Berthollet, though he employed the denominations of
Guyton.

                            GALVANISM.
     . TOURDES, professor in th^School of Medicine at Straf-
burgh, has lately communicated the following notice on this
subject to professor Volta : — " The confidence and friendship
of which you have so often given me proofs during my resi
dence in Italy, embolden me to communicate to you the re
sult of an experiment which appears to me to resolve one of
the most disputed points of physiology, that of the vitality of
the blood. This liquid deprived of the serum, lymph, &c. re
duced to the fibrous part, and subjected to your galvanic or
rather electric apparatus, (for the identity of the galvanic
and electric fluids have been established in an incontestable
 manner by your late researches) at the temperature of about
 30 degrees of Reaumur, exhibited a trembling oscillation and
 palpitation analogous to those experienced by flesh of animals
 newly killed ; a double motion of contratlion and dilatation,
 sensible to the eye by means of a magnifying glass ; a charac
 teristic mark of the vital force peculiar to the muscles, cel
 lular tissue," &c.
     Since our last publication some interesting experiments
 have been performed with the circuit of Volta that have given
 results which, though analogous to facts before known, were
 equally new and interesting, and serve to prove that we are as
 yet only entering the threshold of the inquiry respecting its
  powers, and the purposes to which it it may hereafter be ap
  plicable.
     The experiments alluded to were performed by the As-
 kesian Society on the 4th instant, being their second meeting
  for the present session.
      The battery consisted of two troughs, each containing 60
  plates of silver, and an equal number of zinc; in all 120
  pairs of metallic plates, each 2 j- inches square, or containing
  5TV square inches of surface.
      By means of this battery the Society deflagrated gold with
  great facility.   The gold in thin leaves was connected with
  one end of the battery, and, on being brought into contact
  with the exterior plate of the other end to complete the circuit,
  instantly inflamed.      The combustion only went on at those
   points in which the gold leaf and the plate were in contact,
  and ceased entirely unless the gold was kept advancing against
  the plate, to supply, by fresh portions brought into contact,

 the place of those burnt away. It is singular that no oxide or
 residue of any kind could be discovered; and it is probable
that the gold was volatilized by the fame heat that occasioned
its deflagration : this point, however, is to be further inves
tigated, when a larger portion of gold will be exposed to the
action of the Voltaic circuit, to determine with certainty
whether the whole, or any part of             it,
                                            converted into vapour.

     A new   fact was mentioned at          a   late meeting       of   the British
Mineralogical Society,           by    Mr. Sandman, one of the mem
 bers, and an excellent chemist. Some months since, to one
part of butter of antimony he added five parts of water: in
 stead of an instant precipitation taking place, the mixture as
sumed the form of      athickish mass, of such     consistency, that

the mixture began to clear itself, and threw down            quantity   a
of very white small crystals, some of which were laid before
the Society. Their form could not be accurately determined,
but seemed to approach the cubic. Whether they be crys                      a

Britain, Has been occupied for some time in scries of expe     a

public.    He has tried     number of woods and barks, besides

   A phænomenon was seen to pass Batan R»uge, on the
Mississippi, in the latitude of 31° north, on the night of the
5th of April 1800, of which the following is the belt descrip
tion we have been able to obtain * : — It was first seen in the
south-west, and moved so rapidly, passing over the heads of
the spectators, as to disappear in the north-east in about a
quarter of a minute.     Its apparent size was that of a large
noise seventy or eighty feet long, and of a form nearly re
sembling the annexed figure (Plate V. fig. 3.)
   It appeared to be about 200 yards above the surface of the
earth, wholly luminous, but not emitting sparks ; of a colour
resembling the sun near the horizon in a cold frosty evening,
and which may be called a crimson red. When passing right
over the heads of the spectators, the light on the surface
of the earth was little short of the effect of sun-beams,
though at the fame time, looking another way, the stars
were visible ; which appears to be a confirmation of the opi
nion formed of its moderate elevation.
   In passing, a considerable degree of heat was felt by those
who saw          it,
              but no electric senlation.      Immediately after      it
disappeared   in  the north-east,     violent
                                            a  rushing noise was
heard, as      the phænomenon was bearing down the forest
                 if
before     it,
            and in     few seconds after

same time     very sensible earthquake.

 memoirs, written by the prefects of the different departments,

  of positive information respecting the state of that extensive
  country.
                            EARTHstUAKE.
     The following    are the particulars of an earthquake      which
 took place    at Bologna, as inscribed in the registers       of the
 observatory, by    C.  Ciccolini   :
     This morning (October 8) at 8 hours 52 minutes 53 se
 conds, the air being calm, the sky overcast, and Reaumur's
 thermometer at 13 o}, I felt three strong shocks of an earth
 quake. The direction of the first was from north-east to
south-west : the undulation gradually decreased, when a se
 cond and a third shock were felt in the same direction as the
 first.  These three shocks were in general taken to be one ;
but I was able to distinguish them exactly, as they continued
half a minute; one of the clocks in the observatory having
stopped, I had the exact time of the earthquake.                Some
chimneys      were  thrown    down    in the citv,  one of which  had
almost beat in the ceiling of an apartment where the cele
brated mathematician Soladini lodges.              The remembrance
of the earthquakes which afflicted the city of Bologna almost
for a whole year, in 1779 and 1780, occasioned a general
consternation.      It must, however, be observed, that the state
of the atmosphere was very different from what it was at that
period, the fun being then pale, the sky continually obscured
by clouds of a lead colour, and the horizon darkened by very
thick fogs. Lightning frequently fell, and igneous meteors
appeared under different forms ; and there were above 80
auroræ boreales.      Nothing of the kind took place during the
present    season.   The   earthquake was felt with violence at
Catene    and  Ccuta,

XXXIV.          On the chemical Knowledge which the Philosophers
  of the 16th and         ijtb Centuries bad of the different Gases*.
IVxODERN                 chemistry has been of the utmost service to
the    science      of nature in      general,   by making us better ac
quainted       with     the  finer  substances   or light, caloric, and, in
particular, of the gases : but very imperfect would be our
knowledge of nature, very poor would be our harvest of new
truths, and very insignificant would be our progress in our
researches respecting nature, if we had not reason, from the
rapid advance which philosophy has made in modern times,
to flatter ourselves with the hopes of a more accurate know
ledge of these finer substances.               We should, however, be
guilty of a very great error, if we ascribed the whole merit
of this more accurate knowledge to the 18th cen,tury ; for,
though most of the philosophers of the two preceding cen
turies either overlooked these kinds of gas altogether, or con
sidered them as common air corrupted and deprived of its
elasticity, yet some of them were more clear-sighted, and pe
netrated deeper into these secrets of nature.
    If we pass over the remotest traces which occur here and
there in the works of the antient writers, J. Baptist; van Hel-
mont seems to stand at the head of those more acute-sighted
philosophers ; for, though it cannot be denied that he dis
figured his valuable discoveries by numerous fictions, and
concealed them under new and commonly barbarous names,
 which were for the most part improper; yet he first informed
physicians and naturalists, and proved clearly by observations
and experiments, that, besides the air which we continually
breathe, there are other fluids, which, though they approach
very near to the air in subtlety, transparency, and particularly
in elasticity, yet differ from it very much ; and, as they differ
also from vapours, he has distinguished                 them by the parti
cular name of gas-f. He endeavoured to establish the dif
ference between them bv this circumstance — that as air nou
rishes flame, these fluids extinguish it X, and even the vital
flame §.       He was acquainted also with the air of the cele-

cautions had been given long before his time by Andrew

they killed animals which had purposely or accidentally been
exposed to them, as well as imprudent persons, and particu
larly miners.      He was in particular acquainted with that gas
which some, because it inflames when it comes in contact
with a burning body, call inflammable gas, and which others,
because they consider it as an essential component part of
water, name hydrogen gas ; and he knew also that it had
been observed before him in mines by Libavius : he con
vinced himself that even eructations were of the fame na
 ture, and that it formed a principal component part of
smoke: he likewise considered flame to be only inflamed
 smoke §.     His knowledge, however, was not confined to this
 gas  alone,  for under the name of gas Jjlve/lre he was ac
 quainted    with  nitrous gas, produced by the action of aqua
 fortis when silver is dissolved in it      and he knew also, that

 for what else could he understand        that gas into which, to

a
    burning   taper under      glass in luch a    manner that   a stood                it
three inches above the water in the vessel, he saw the water
rife, assume the place of the decreasing air, and at length
extinguish the taper.
     He had observed also that an air could be produced from
 nitre, which he called flame gas, and which was disen
 gaged on coal being added to              and he thence conjectured
                                                   it   ||
                                                         ;
 the presence of vital air in that salt.      He entertained also the
 Opinion, which modern chemistry has supported                   manv             by   so
 conclusive proofs, that all these air-like fluids        are indebted       %
 for their form to the effects of fire, or, as we commonly fay
 at present, to caloric.
    It  canrtbt, however, be denied, that Van Helmont consi
 dered as different gases those which differ only            accidental          by
 corruption, as the carbonic acid gas, according as              drawn            it   is
 from this or that body, and in this or that manner; and that
 he confounded others, or did not make              proper distinction
                                                                    a
 between them.        Yet   before  Priestley,  most  of the philoso
 phers   who   paid attention   to this  subject,  made  no other dif
  ference between these kinds of gas, than that some of them
  inflame when brought into contact with                burning body,    a
  while others instantly extinguish        flame.         a
     Van Helmont suspected also, as appears clearly from his
  own words, the great similarity which, in regard to air,                                        is
  found between flame and animal life. This was more clearly

 breathing animals which breathe through real lungs have
need    of more air than those which merelv evaporate, that is to
 fay, than such was have no evident and real lungs ; and as,
 in general, a stronger fire requires a stronger draught of air
 than a weaker, in the like manner a more active life requires
 quicker breathing, and a more sluggish a flower: as air acts
 differently on flame according as it is more or less clear, warm,
 or dry, in the like manner it acts upon breathing and the
 vital flame: and, in the last place, as flame burns more
 briskly according, as it has free access to the air on all fides,
 and is weaker when the air is withheld, and is at length to
tally extinguished, breathing is exposed to the same effedts
under the Tike circumstances.
    This Sylvius proved nothing by experiments, but he made
it probabie, according to his manner, that sourish particles
of nitre* floated about in the common atmosphere; and
approached so near to the prevailing principles of the present
day t, that he supposed fire (or caloric) was continually dif
fused through the air.
    The celebrated Spanish mineralogist Alphonso Barba was
acquainted with those pernicious damps which arise so often
in mines, and which, though they resemble air in other re
spects, have however an offensive smell, extinguish lights,
and deprive men, birds, and even snakes, of their life J.
    Boyle, to whom natural philosophy in general is under so
many obligations, ascribed that increase of weight which
metals acquire by calcination §, as he had frequently observed,
rather to the fire than to particles from the atmosphere, and
was therefore very remote from that opinion which prevails
in the present century, and which is supported by so many
experiments; but he was at the fame time acquainted with

    At the same period, F. Slare and T. Willis ascribed * the
dark red colour of the blood to the air; and J. Mayowf»
another Englishman, with whom another Oxford physician,
Henry Mund J, and also Willis §, L. M. Barbieri, and.
J. B. Giovanni concurred, made the whole use of breath
                               ||,
ing to .consist in this — that the lungs of animals inhale from
the atmosphere nitrous particles, which are diffused over the
animal spirits and communicate warmth to the blood.
J. N. Pechlin^f, also, attributes the faculty of some divers
being able to remain longer under water to greater quan                          a
tity of nitre.   From all this      appears that the physicians of
                                                    it
that period had      kind of idea of vital air, and its influence
                               a
on the animal œconomy.
    Stephen Hales, who made further progress             his nume                     by
rous experiments in discovering the secrets of nature, placed,
beyond all doubt,          long series of experiments, the elasti
                                     by   a
city of these fluids as they are expelled from bodies          heat,                            by
fermentation, corruption, and effervescence,         power which                  a
was before observed           Newton **, and at the same time
                                          by
showed several and ingenious methods            how they could be      ft
obtained, preserved, measured, weighed, and even handled.
He remarked the inflammability of those which the inflam
mable bodies of every kingdom of nature yield              exposure                        by
to    astrong heat, the properties of others which arise from
effervescing mixtures, and which suddenly extinguish flame.
 He observed likewise, exceedingly well, the great difference
 of the nitrous gas which he obtained when he poured upon
 antimony aqua regia, or spirit of nitre       or the latter diluted   ;
 with water [aquafortis] upon iron filings or quicksilver, and
 its property of forming red clouds with common air as soon
 as   itconies    contact with

 ot'tener the experiment was repeated, the gas always absorbed
  the less air; that several of these gales were absorbed                                                  by

 \tnfit for respiration.    He knew also the ammoniacal as well
 as the muriatic acid gas, and the sulphuric acid gas, and
 had learned, from his own experience,             that the latter can
 be as strongly comprefled          as common air.        He knew also
 that metals increase in weight by calcination, and again
 decrease on being revived ; for he found that red lead in the
 preparation had increased in weight about a twentieth part,
 and by a strong heat gave a great deal of air: his own ex
 perience had taught him also that phosphorus, sulphur, and
a tallow candle, absorb some of the air in which they burn,
as animals absorb some of the air in which the* breathe;
though he ascribed the pernicious change which the air
 thereby experiences,      not to the loss it sustains^ but rather
 to the corrupt evaporation with which it is filled.                 He
had observed, though less perfectly, that phosphorus after
combustion increased in weight by imbibing something
from the atmosphere.            He had discovered that an aeri
form substance was contained in acidulous waters, and
       \
that air was continually absorbed by plants in a healthy
state
    In this difficult doctrine, however,         he left a great deal to
be explained by his followers; for he did not define and was
not acquainted with the difference of many of the gases, and
some of them escaped his notice altogether.           The further illus
tration of them was reserved for the modem chemists. Thus,
in particular, the following authors have very much contri
buted to enlarge our knowledge of the carbonic acid : — »

     By Mr. Humphry Daw, Lecturer en Chemistry in the
     Royal Institution *.
I.   r\LL      the galvanic combinations analogous to the new
apparatus       of Mr. Volta, which  have been heretofore described
bv experimentalists,    consist  (as far as my knowledge extends)
of series containing at least two metallic substances, or one
metal and charcoal, and         stratum of fluid. And
                                   a                      has been     it
generally    supposed that  their   agencies arc,    some      in
                                                          measure,
connected with the different powers of the metals to conduct
electricity.     But have found that an accumulation of gal
                         I
vanic influence, exactly similar to the accumulation in the
common pile, may be produced              the arrangement of single
                                             by
metallic plates, or arcs, with different strata of fluids.
   The train of reasoning which led to the discovery of this
fact, was produced           by
                         the observation of some phenomena
relating to the connection of chemical changes with the evo
lution of galvanic power.
          * From
                 Irfuisallitns oflbe Royal   Society   of   London   for iSor.
                                                                                   It

             formed   by Jingle Metallic Plates and Fluids.     29V
      It appeared, in several experiments, that series of double
  metallic plates, incapable of acting as galvanic combinations,
  when arranged in the proper order, with portions of water,
  were readily made to produce galvanic effects, by being al
  ternated with acids, or other fluids capable of oxidating one
  only of the metals of the series.      Thus, double plates, com
  posed of silver and gold, (metals which have been supposed
  to differ verv little in their powers of conducting electricity,)
  produced galvanic action, when placed in contact, in the
  common orJ-r, with cloths moistened in diluted nitric acid.
  And copper and silver acted powerfully with nitrate of mer
  cury.
       These facts induced me to suppose, that the alternation of
  two metallic bodies with fluids, was essential to the produc
  tion of accumulated galvanic influence, only so far as it fur
  nished two conducting surfaces of different degrees of oxida-
  bility; and that this production would take place, if single
   metallic plates could be connected together by disserent fluids
   in such a manner, that one of their surfaces only should un
   dergo oxidation, the arrangement being regular.
       On this supposition, I made a number of experiments on
   disserent arrangements of nugle metals and fluids; and, atter
   manv various processes, I was enabled to ascertain, that many
   i»f these arrangements could be made active, not only when
   oxidations, but likewise when other chemical changes were
   going on in some of their parts.
/      In describing the different galvanic combinations formed
   by single metallic plates and fluids, I shall divide them into
   three classes, following, in the arrangement, the order of
   time with regard to discovery.
       II. The first and most feeble class is composed, whenever
   single metallic piates, or arcs, are arranged in such a manner,
   that two of their surfaces, or ends opposite to each other, are
   in contact with different fluids, one capable, and the other
   incapable, of oxidating the metal. In this cafe, if the series
   are numerous, and in regular alternation, galvanic influence
   will be accumulated, analogous, in all its effects, to the in
   fluence of the common pile.
        Tin, zinc, and some other easily oxidable metals, act most
   powerfully in this class of combinations.
        If pieces of polished tin, about an inch square and -^ of
    an inch thick, be connected with woollen cloths of the fame
    size, ^moistened, sonic in water, and some in diluted nitrous
    acid,) in the following order— tin, acid, water, and so on,
    till twenty series are put together — a feeble galvanic battery
    will be formed, capable of acting weakly on the organs of
                                                               fense,

   304             Account    of Galvanic   Combinations
   sense,   and  of slowly producing the common appearances In
    water;   the  wire from the oxidating surface of the plates
   evolving hydrogen, and the wire from the non-oxidating
   surface (when of silver) depositing oxide.
/*    In all cases, when the batteries ofthe first class are erected
   perpendicularly, the cloth moistened in acid must be placed
   under the cloth moistened in water; and, in this arrange
   ment, as the acid is specifically heavier than water, little or
   no mixture of the fluids will take place.
      When zinc is employed, on account of its rapid oxidation in
   water containing atmospheric air, three cloths should be used ;
   the first moistened in weak solution of sulphuret of potasli,
   (which is possessed of 'no power of action upon zinc, and
   which prevents it from acting upon the water;) the second
   moistened    in a solution  of  sulphate  of potash,  of greater spe
  cific gravity than the solution of sulphuret; and the third
   wetted in an oxidating fluid specifically heavier than either
  of the solutions. In this cafe, if the order be as follows —
   zinc, oxidating solution, solution of sulphate of potash, so
  lution of sulphuret of potash — very little mixture of the fluids,
  or chemical action between them, will take place ; and an
  alternation of twelve series of this kind forms a batterv ca
  pable of producing sensible effects,
      III. The second class of galvanic combinations with single
  plates is formed, when plates, or arcs, composed of a me
  tallic substance capable of acting upon sulphurated hydrogen,
  or upon sulphurets dissolved in water, are formed into series,
  with portions of a solution of sulphuret of potash and water,
  in such a manner, that one side of even,' plate, or arc, is in
  contact with water, whilst the opposite side is acted on by
  the solution of sulphuret.       Under these circumstances, when
  the alternation      is- regular, and the number of series suffi-
  cientlv great, galvanic power is evolved ; and water, placed in
  the circuit with silver wires, is acted on ; oxide being depo
  sited on the wire connected with the fide of the plate under
  going; chemical alteration, whilst hydrogen is evolved from
  the side in contact with water.
      Silver, copper, and lead, are each capable of forming this
  combination.       Plates made from either of those metals may
  be arranged with cloths, (moistened,            some in water, and
  others in solution of sulphuret of potash,) in the following
  order— metal, cloth moistened in sulphuret of potasli, cloth
  moistened in water, and so on.
      Eight series will produce sensible effects; and the wire
   from the top of the pile produces oxide.
                                                                 Copper

             formed hy singh Metallic Plates and Plu'uls.          205
        Copper is more adtive, in this class of batteries, than silver;
     and silver more active than lead.
         IV. The third and molt powerful class of galvanic batte-
/^   ries, constructed with fluids and single metals, is formed
      when metallic substances oxidable in acids, and capable of
     acting on solutions of fulphurets, arc connected, as plates,
     with oxidating fluids and solutions of sulphuret of potash, in
     such a manner, that the opposite fides of every plate may be
     undergoing different chemical changes ; the mode of alter
     nation being regular.
        The fame metals that act in the second class may be used
     in the third class; and the order of their powers is similar.
     The pile may be erected in the fame manner as the pile with
     zinc in the first class ; the cloths moistened in acid being
     separated from those moistened in solution os sulphuret by a
     third cloth soaked in solution of sulphate of potash.
        Three plates of copper or silver, arranged in this manner,
     in the just order, produce sensible effects; and twelve or
     thirteen series are capable of giving weak shocks, and of
     rapidly producing gas and oxide in water ; {he wire connected
     with the oxidating end of the apparatus evoIvTngTivdYogcn ;
     and the wire attached to the end acting on the sulphuret,
    depositing oxide when composed of silver, and generating
    oxygen when of gold.
        V. In all the single metallic piles constructed with cloths,
    the action is very transient : the decomposition of the acids,
    and of the fulphurets, is generally completed in a few mi
    nutes; and, in consequence, the galvanic influence ceases to
    be evolved.     The arrangement of all the different series may,
     however, (by means of an apparatus constructed after the
    ideas of count Kumford,) be made in such a manner as to
    give considerable permanency to their effects.         This appa
    ratus is a box, covered with cement incapable of conducting
    electricity, and composed of three pieces of mahogany, each
    containing grooves capable of receiving the edges of the dif
    ferent plates proper for composing the series.        One half of
    these plates must be composed of horn or glass, and the other
    half of metallic substances ; and the conductors of electricity,
    and the non-conductors,       must be alternately cemented into
    the grooves, so as to form water-tight cells.
        When the apparatus is used, these cells are filled, in the
 'X galvanic order, with different solutions, according to the class
    of the combination; and connected in pairs with each other,
    by flips of moistened cloth, carried over the non-conducting
    plates.
       A   combination of fifty copperplates, arranged  in this man-

    206            Experiments     on the   Chemical Production
    ner, with weak solutions of nitrous acid, or nitrate of am
    moniac, and sulphuret of potash, gives pretty strong shocks*
    rapidly evolves gas from water, and affects the condensing
    electrometer.
       It does not lose its power of action for many hours ; and,
    when, this power is lost, it may be restored by the addition
    of small quantities of concentrated solutions of the proper
    chemical agents to- the fluids in the different cells.
       From two experiments made on copper and silver, it would
    appear, that the single metallic batteries act equally wellj
    when the metals made use of are slightly alloyed, and when
    they are in a state of purity.
    XXXVI.      Experiments on the chemical Produclion and Agency
      of   Electricity.  By William Hyde Wollaston,'
      M.D. F.R.S.*
    N.OTWITHStanding             the power of Mr. Volta's electric
    pile is now known to be proportional to the disposition of
    one of the metals to be oxidated by the fluid interposed, a
    doubt has been entertained by many persons, (whether this
    power arises from the chemical action of the fluid on the
    metal ; or, on the contrary, whether the oxidation itself may
    not be occasioned by electricity, set in motion by the contact
    of metals that have different conducting powers.
       That the oxidation of the metal is the primary cause of
>   the electric phænomena observed,             is,
                                              think, to be inferred
                                                  I
    from the following experiments, which exhibit the galvanic
i   process reduced to its most simple state.
       Exper.  i. Isa piece of zinc and piece of silver have each
                                                 a
    one extremity immersed in the same vessel, containing sul
    phuric or muriatic acid diluted with    large quantity of water,
                                                  a
    the zinc  is dissolved, and yields hydrogen gas,        decom  by
    position of the water the silver, not being acted upon, has
                               :
    no power of decomposing water      but, whenever the zinc and
                                            ;
    silver are made    to touch, or any metallic communication             id
    made between them, hydrogen gas          also formed at the sur
                                                  is
    face of the silver.
       Any other metal         beside zinc,     which   by   assistanceof the
    acid employed         is
                        capable        of
                                    decomposing              water, will suc
    ceed equally,     the other wire consists of
                      if                           metal on which
                                                         a
    the acid has no effect.

                    zinc, iron, or copper, are employed with gold,

                                                                           in

  "m   dilute nitric acid, nitrous gas is formed, in the fame man
  ner, and under the lame circumstances, as the hydrogen gas
  in the former experiment.
       Expcr.$. Experiments analogous to the former, and equally
  simple, may also be made with many metallic solutions.              If,
  for instance, the solution contains copper, it will be precipi
  tated by a piece of iron, and appear on its surface.             Upon
  silver merely immersed in the same solution, no such effect is
  produced ; but as soon as the two metals are brought into
   contact, the silver receives a coating of copper.
/".
       In the explanation of these experiments, it is necessary to
   advert to a point established by means of the electric pile.
       We know that when water is placed in a circuit of con
   ductors of electricity > between the two extremities of a pile,
   if the power is sufficient to oxidate one of the wires of com
   munication, the wire connected with the opposite extremity
   affords hydrogen gas.
        Since the extrication of hydrogen, in this instance, is seen
    to depend on electricity, it is probable that, in other in
    stances, electricity may be also requisite for its conversion
    into gas. t It would appear, therefore, that in the solution of
    a metal, electricity is evolved during the action of the acid
    upon    it; and that the formation of hydrogen gas, even in that
    cafe, depends on       transition of electricity between the fluid
                           a
    and the metal.
        We fee, moreover, in the first experiment, that the zinc,
    without contact of any other metal, has the power of decom
     posing water     and we can have no reason to suppose that the
                       ;
     contact of the silver produces any new power, but that                it
     serves merely as     conductor of electricity, and thereby occa
                           a
     sions the formation of hydrogen gas.
         In the third experiment also, the iron                    by
                                                           itself has the
     power of precipitating copper            by
                                           means,     presume, of elec
                                                           I
     tricity evolved during its solution         and  here
                                                       ;     likewise the
     silver,      by
                  conducting    that electricity, acquires  the  power of
     precipitating the copper in its metallic state.
         The explanation here given receives additional confirma
     tion from comparative experiments which            have made with
                                                               I

                                                      it,   a    3
sealing-wax, and,           by
                           cutting through in the middle of the
wax, exposed      section of the wire.
                   a                         The two coated extre
mities or the wire, thus divided, were immersed              solutionin   a
of sulphate of copper placed in an electric circuit between
the two conductors; and sparks, taken at T'^ of an inch di
stance, were passed         by
                           means of them through the solution.
After 100 turns of the machine, the wire which communi
cated with (what       called) the negative conductor had
                       is                                        pre           a
cipitate formed  on  its surface, which, upon being burnished,
was evidently copper        but the opposite wire had no such
                             ;
coating.
   Upon reversing the direction of the current of electricity,
the order of the pliænomena was of course reversed                the          ;

   The chemical agency, therefore, of common electricitv                           is
thus proved to be the lame with the power excited              che            by

poses water, and produces other effects of oxidation and de-
oxidation of bodies exposed to its action,       have been at some

very close imitation of the galvanic phenomena            common     by
electricity.
    It has been thought necessary to employ powerful ma
chines and large Leyden jars for the decomposition of water;
but, when     I  considered that the decomposition must depend
on dulv proportioning the strength of the charge of electricity
to the quantity of water, and that the quantity exposed to its
action at the surface of communication depends on the extent
of that surface, hoped that,
                   I                 reducing the surface of com
                                          by
munication, the decomposition of water might be effected                           by
smaller machines, and with less powerful excitation, than
have hitherto been used for that purpose; and in this hope
I have not been disappointed.

regia through      capillary tube, and,
                        a                                by
                                               heating the tube,
expelled the acid.  There remained       thin film of gold lining
                                                a
the inner surface of the tube, which, by melting the tube,
was converted into       very sine thread of gold, through the
                             a
substance of the glass.
   When the extremity of this thread was made the medium
of communication through water,         found that the mere
                                                I
current of electricity would occasion     stream of very small
                                                    a
bubbles to rife from the extremity of the gold, although the
wire,     by
          which      communicated with the positive or nega
                        it
tive conductor, was placed in absolute contact with them.
Hence    appears that decomposition of water may take place
          it
by  common electricity as well as          by
                                    the electric pile, although
no discernible sparks are produced.
   The appearance of two currents of air may also be imitated
by  occasioning the electricity to pass              by
                                           fine points of com
munication on both sides of the water but, in fact, the re

               it, is

have tried         observed that each wire gave both oxygen
                    I
and hydrogen gas, instead of their being formed separately,
as   bythe electric pile.
I    am inclined to attribute the difference in this respect to
the greater intensity with which          necessary to employ
                                               it   is

ib excited, have each the fame chemical power as they are

observed to have in the electric pile, may be ascertained by
other means.
   In the precipitation of copper bv silver, an instance of de-
oxidation (or phlogisiicntion) by negative electricity has been
mentioned : the oxidating power of positive electricity may
be also proved by its efiVct on vegetable blue colours.
   Exft-r. 8. Having coloured a card with a strong infusion
of litmus, I palled a current of electric sparks along      bv            it,
means of two line gold points, touching     at the distance of
                                                        it
an inch from each other. The effect, as in other cafes, de
pending on the smallness of the quantity of water, was most
discernible when the card was nearly dry.             In this state,            a
very few turns of the machine were sufficient to occasion                       a
redness at the positive wire, very manifest to the naked eye.
The negative wire, being afterwards placed on the fame spot,
soon restored      to its original blue colour.

    By Mr. Volta's apparatus, the fame effects are produced
in much less time.
    Beside the similarity which has thus been traced between
the effects of electricity excited       the common machine and
                                             by
those observed from the electric pile,          think

    With regard to the latter, its power           now known to de

     After trying the degree of excitement in common air,                       I

 galvanism appear to be excited, in addition to the resemblance
 that has been traced between their effects, {hows that they
 are both essentially the fame, and confirms an opinion that

XXXVI I.         On the Presenfation        -which Animals         have of

 I
if I
     SHOULD
      should attempt
                    only repeat what has been already long known,
                         to prove that, by the great enlargement
of our knowledge respecting the natural history of foreign
 animals, by means of various learned travellers, we are now
enabled to explain, to the satisfaction of the judicious natu
ralist, many phænomena which occur among indigenous
animals.       The sensations which take place in animal bodies
before a change of weather, which animals express by va
 rious external appearances, and which, without taking part
in the dispute whether animals are endowed or not with
fouls, may be called a preservation, seem however to require
considerable explanation.         1 am well aware         that it will be
impossible for me to explain things which have not as yet
been perfectly explained bv men of the greatest knowledge;
but I am convinced that everv thing which can contribute
to the illustration of an obscure subject deserves to be sub
mitted to a proof, and that it is of use to communicate even
single observations on points concerning which systems can
not be formed till after the expiration of centuries. Con
sidering the subject in this point of view, I present the fol
lowing.
    Presenfation    may be admitted under three heads : — I. The
presenfation which animals have of dry fair weather. II. The
preservation which animals have of rainy weather. III. The
presenfation which animals have of stormy weather.
    What regards the two first classes of the presenfation of
animals is taken from the Gottingen Pocket Almanac for
the year 1770, the editor of which, as is well known, was
at that period counsellor Lichtenberg.             In that work I found
the   most   authentic observations     of  the  latest writers collected
         ':
            From Magaain fur   das  Neuejic aus dcr fbyfikt vol. vii.
                                   O *                            together.

2 1a             Presensation  which Animals have
together.      The  observations  respecting  the third class  I col
lected myself.
     First, then, respecting the presensation which animals have
of fair dry   weather.
     Clear, dry weather generally follows after wet weather,
when the atmosphere has been freed from the vapours col
lected In it by their falling to the earth in rain.       Clouds as
well as rain arc the means by which the air frees itself from
the electric vapours that are continually arising; and if these
again fall down, it appears very natural that animals, which
live chiefly in the open air, should express, by various ex
 ternal movements, the ease with which they breathe, and
perform all the vital functions.        From this principle it seems
 not difficult to explain the following observations:
     The fluttering of bats in the evening, beetles flying about
 on the highways, and the sporting of gnats towards sunset,
 require no explanation.       I shall only remark, what is already
 well known to every observer, that this presensation is highly
 useful to bats as well as to insects.        Every shower of rain
 would render it impossible for them to fly, as their wings
 are not secured by any oily matter against moisture; they
 would therefore be rendered much heavier by rain, and unfit
 for flying, and they could not be so easily placed again in
 folds, which, considering the structure of these animals, is
 absolutely necessary, as when they have remained dry.
     The lame principle seems to be applicable to the high
 flight of larks and swallows, which perhaps hasten to the
  upper regions of the atmosphere because they are freer front
  vapours and more suited to them, and because the lower re
  gions, being more loaded with vapours, afford them less plea
  sure than those above.      The insects also which they pursue
  for food take then, perhaps, a higher flight.
      The croaking of the green water-frog in ponds I cannot
  sufficiently explain ; but it seems to express the pleasure
  arising from the greater quantity of insects then flying about,
  and which they can catch with more ease and convenience.
  But clear dry weather is not so agreeable to frogs as the re
  turn of warm weather. If they make a noise in the time of
  cold rain, warm dry weather will follow.           But if the dry
   weather proceeds from raw winds, and if warmth and rain
   succeed, their noise may foretel rain ; and therefore Lin-
   næus's rule prœdicit pluviani will lose nothing of its truth.
   He seems so much the more to be right, as more raw than
   warm dry days take place in the climate of Sweden. I have,
   to my great inconvenience, experienced the truth of his asser
                                                                 tion;

 following class, did not experience admit also of another ex
 planation, viz. that the birds, from the atmosphere becoming
 lighter, hope for the speedy arrival of drv weather, and there
 fore anoint themselves, and secure their feathers from moisture,
 that thev may be able to fly higher than usual with the less
 impediment.        If the last explanation ought not to be alto
 gether rejected, as I do not think it can, we may admit of
 this observation ; especially as all the experience of men
 worthy of belief allows of no reasoning to be brought
 against it.
     The expression of animals which show a presensation of
rainy weather may be explained partly from the increasing
weight of the atmosphere, partly from their manner of living,
and partly from the want of moisture which is necessary to
their existence.
     The rcflleifness of domestic cattle may proceed from many
causes.      It is known that the atmosphere in summer, before
rain soils, is generally heavier, on account of the electric
vapour     that arises.       The insects which infest cattle, and
which mark this heaviness, become then more numerous,
and, getting into the stalls where the cattle are kept, torment
them and make them restless. The ascending vapour has
also perhaps some influence on the skins of these animals,
which ceases when the earth does not suffer so much vapour
to escape as before ; or the air, too strongly charged with
electricity, excites in them an unpleasant sensation.                It in-
    * So called because kept in Germany to forctel changes of the weather.
When the weather     is sine they continue quiet, but before a storm or rain

414                  Vrejensation   -which Animals have
deed appears strange to explain the fame phænomenon from,
two perfectly opposite causes, a want and an excess of electri
city ; but we know cafes of the like kind in medicine, such, for
example, as that where the cramp and sleep produces atonia.
People who have wounds or old ulcers feel, on a change of
weather, a contraction and burning in thole parts; and why
should not such affections take place in animals ?
    All these grounds taken together will be sufficient, in my
opinion, to explain why horses and asses rub themselves,
 (hake their heads, and snuff the air by turning up their noses;
why asses bray much, and jump about; why cattle scrape up
 the earth, and stamp with their feet; and why swine, though
not hungry, eat greedily and dig up the eartli a great deal
with their snouts.      The restlessness, running about, scraping
 with the feet, and eating grass, among dogs; and moles
 continually throwing up the earth, can all be deduced from
 the fame; as well as the cats dressing themselves.
   I   have remarked      that cocks crow on every change of
 weather, besides at    the usual time.    Thev as well as pigeons
  hasten  to their places  of sticker in order to be secured against
  the rain, the approach os which thev must be sensible of, by
 the continually increasing weight of the atmosphere.
     The cause of fowls, pigeons, quails, aud other birds, wash
  ing themselves, appears to me to be a certain heat or itching,
  which they wish by these means to remove.
     Swallows, in all probability, take a low flight on the ap
  proach of rainy weather, because the electric atmosphere is

  I     have remarked   in ravens, that their croaking, unless

 perhaps,       by

 storm highly disagreeable to them will soon take place, and

birds of the forest should hasten to their nests is very natural,
as front the state of the atmosphere they must apprehend
rain.
   The crying of peacocks, except at pairing time, appears
to he a phenomenon analogous to the crowing of cocks.
 I have often remarked it on a change of weather, and often
even on a change of wind.
   That storks and cranes place their hills under their wings,
is a phenomenon remarked also among domestic fowls when
thev sly to their roosts. to secure themselves against rain. Their
pecking their breasts seems to signify an itching sensation in
that part of their bodies.
   The croaking of the male green or tree frog seems to
denote an unpleasant sensation, for in sine weather I never
heard them send forth the smallest cry.         Rut the appearance
of toads implies a pleasant sensation, as these animals arc so
fond of living in dirt.
    Ants labour with great diligence, and bees hasten home,
and do not    flyfar from their hives, because thev follow their
instinct. The former endeavour to complete their habitations
and to secure themselves better against rain, and perhaps to
lay up provision for the rainy season.      The latter hasten home
to their hives, and    slyno more abroad, because the wet would
impede them in their flight and labour.
    Gnats [pomps) come into houses to secure themselves from
rain, which would impede their flight, and there they attach
themselves to the legs to procure that nourishment which                   is
denied them without.

                                      I
tural history ot these infects   is as yet too obscure.
    Earth-worms creep from their holes through instinct, as
thev can move themselves forward only upon earth that                      is
slippery.

duced instances; else one might consider the shutting and ex
panding of many plants as foreboding variations of the weather.
   The dog, on the approach of rainy weather, expresses signs
of uneasiness; scratches himself, because the fleas then bite
him with more violence ; digs up the earth with his feet,
runs round, and eats grafs : he is accustomed, however, to do
the latter when he i? very hot, perhaps to cool himself, and
in general a storm follows soon after. Before a storm he eva
porates more strongly, so that his smell becomes intolerable ;
he creeps in a dejected manner to his master, and lies quiet.
The cat also seems to have this in common with the dog, that
she creeps to her mailer also on the approach of a storni. But
all these phæriomcna require a further explanation.
   The most perfect of all animals, man, is on the approach
of storms only subject to certain unpleasant sensations; but
these must teach him, in the most striking manner, that his
spiritual part, even though it disengages itself so much from
oppressive cares, is irremediably connected here below with a
fluggifli body, which frequently exercises tyrannic sway over
the soul.   Men in a sound state of health are subjected, on
the approach     of stormy weather, to a heaviness of body and
mind,    a want of capatuy to perform their usual occupations,
a yawning     and relaxation, which are highly disagreeable.
These    are often  accompanied also wit'> a sensation of heat.
AU   these  phænomcna appear in some more and in others less,
and   in  some   do not take place at all : but the last case hap
pens   very  rarely. Sick persons, or thole whose juices are
corrupted, experience,     besides the above, an itching heat in
those parts of their bodies which arc covered ; and many who
hive old wounds, ulcers, and the like, have in these uncom
mon sensations.      Many of these may be ascribed to perspira
tion checked by the great heat; though, as Weikard, a phi
losophic physician, ;iliert«, the want of electric matter in the
body may have some share in them alto.
   When stormy weather happens in winter, these sensations,
as well as the before-mentioned presensation of animals, do
not take place ; at least no one has ever observed them. This,
jn all probability, arises from the influence of the season.
   I must conclude this essay with requesting, that what I
have here said may be considered, as it really       is, an hypo«
thejtic explanation of well known facts.

company were on horseback, because it is not possible to
travel through the mountains in any other manner.       Bv way

we were furnished with a guard of fifty regular Cossacs and
sixty chasseurs.
   On the 15th we crossed the Lesser Kabarda, which is ruled
by several princes subject to the Russian government, and
next day arrived at Wladi-kaukas, a fortress lately con
structed at the bottom of the higher Caucasian ridge, in
order to protect our communication with Georgia ; from
which we proceeded on the 17th to ascend the mountains.
   Caucasus, which the Persians, Indians, and Arabians call
Kukas, extends from the Black to the Caspian lea. This ridge
of mountains we had to cross in its whole breadth to the ca
pital of Georgia, from which the chain proceeds to Anatolia
and along the Euphrates. Its greatest length is from the mouth
of the river Kuba to Derbcnt.      A chain of snow mountains
runs along the middle of this ridge from the Black to the
Caspian sea.     Two rivers flow from these snow mountains in
this neighbourhood j one of which is the well-known Terek,
that throws itself into the Caspian sea below the Russian for
tress of K'flar; the other, called Aragui, runs towards the
south, and falls into the Kur ne-.r the town of Zcheta, at the
distance of about fifteen wersts frr.m Teflis.    Along the Kur
and the Terek a commodious roaii was constructed, about
two years ago, in order to open a free communication with
Georgia; and this route in the summer- time is passable for
carriages ; but in the winter it is not possible to travel in that

 times, and      still used among the people themselves, but
                 is                                                      by

 no affinity to any of the Asiatic dialects but the Persian.
Those who live to the north are still pagans, and worship
dogs, cats, and various other animals which have been struck
 by  lightning. Their habitations are all like fortresses, and
surrounded        antique round towers, &c.

    On the 18th we arrived at the snow mountains, after
being attacked at      a  narrow pass on our way             by
                                                       the above-
mentioned Ossetines.        The pretended cause was, that thev
demanded toll from us        ; but, as     had been fettled
                                          it                        by

the princes residing among the mountains, that every thing
belonging to Russia should be suffered to pass free, our com
mander would not comply with their demand, nor pay them
a  single farthing.     When the Ossetines found that they could
obtain nothing, they began to roll down on us astonishing
large masses of rock; and they discharged also their fire-arms,
but without doing us any hurt.          Our ambassador, however,
was    soincensed, that he commanded 60 of the chasseurs and
150 of the Cossacs, who formed our escort, to march against
them but they could not reach them but
       ;                                                 circuitous

route of about forty wersis.       When the Ossetines saw that
this party   were  going round   to attack them         in
                                                    the rear, they
solicited   forgiveness,   and suffered us to pass unmolested.
   On the 19th we continued to ascend the snow mountains,
where we were much astonished at the sudden change of the
climate.   Hitherto the weather had been temperate, aud we
had enjoyed the most beautiful views, highly picturesque on
account of the different colours of the rocks, which in many
places were ornamented with       sort of crystallized figures. In

the cypress-like juniper trees, the chestnut, and other beautiful
trees, are every where round mixed in the most agreeable
manner.    Travelling, however, through the snow mountains
was not     so
           pleasant.   Where we eroded them they consisted
                                                                         of

  We then paflid    the second ridge, which however seemed
to be far more dangerous, as it is remarkably steep.      When
we had ascended halfway the road became so narrow, that
between the perpendicular rock on the one fide, and the pre
cipice, more than 400 fathoms in depth, at the bottom of
which is the bed of the river, only two or three feet were left
for us to pass.     While in this situation a violent wines
arose, as is commonly the cafe, and drove down a prodigious
quantity of snow, which, as misfortune would have            it,
                                                              fell
 upon our ambassador, his steward, and       a  riding boy, and
hurried them all together, with their horses, to the bottom.
Luckily there happened to be in this place projection of
                                                     a
rock, on which they all three fell but
                                     ;     so covered with snow
that for some minutes they could not be seen, until they had
 forced their wav from the snow with their heads.        We im
 mediately let down to them,   by means of ropes, few Cossacs
                                                         a
and Offetines, who are very expert on such occasions. These
 people, having descended in this manner at least 140 fathoms,
 helped the ambassador and the other two persons from the
 snow, and, having made them fast to ropes, they were drawn
 up without anv further accident. Amidst fear and terror we
 proceeded with the caravan through this dangerous place,
 dreading every moment that    a new fall of snow rolling down
 from the mountain would hurry us to the bottom of the pre
 cipice. By the protection of Providence, however, we were
 preserved, and arrived  in safety at the top of the mountain.
 Our ambassador was not hurt        by
                                    his fall, but greatly fright
 ened.    Two of the horses, contrary to all expectation, found
 means to clamber up the steep side of the mountain          ;and
 though they often fell among the snow          sothat nothing of
 them was to be seen except the head, they made their way
  through it; but the third was too weak; and while exerting
                                                               the

the last remains of his strength by a sudden spring, he fell
back and rolled down the precipice, so that we saw no more
of him.
    We now descended the mountain, the road being neither
very steep nor long, till we arrived at the next ridge, which
is, as it were, placed upon the former. This third and highest
snow mountain was so steep that we almost despaired of being
 able to pass it.     We found it now impossible to ride; for,
  though  the  road was  here and there two feet in breadth, we
 were frequently obliged, for the distance of half a werst and
 more, to clamber over the rocks sometimes up to the middle
 in snow. When we had at length, with great labour, pain,
 and fatigue, got to the summit, we observed the clouds rolling
 under us, and could no longer fee any thing of the surround
 ing country. We now travelled above an hour, involved in
 a lort of thick fog, exposed to the wind and snow, and to a
 more penetrating cold than we ever remembered            to ha.ve-
ekperienced at Petersburgh.
    When we began to descend from this high ridge, and had
got about half way down, three of the mules laden with the
service of silver plate destined as a present to Persia,.fell into
a small fissure near the road, which at first, as we saw their
heads above the snow, did not appear to be of much conse
quence. These animala, however, exerted their whole strength
to extricate themselves, and two of them were fortunate
enough to succeed ; but the third, which had approached
too near to the declivity of the mountain, by its exertions
fell deeper into the snow, and, getting still nearer and nearer
to the edge of the precipice, rolled down the side of the moun
tain to the depth of about 400 fathoms from the road.         The
boxes containing the plate broke loose by the violence of the
fall, one rolling down on one side and the other on the other;
and one of them, being dallied against the projecting point
os a rock, burst in two ; but the other fell unhurt on a small
eminence which was at the distance of two hundred fathoms
from us.     In that situation we were obliged to leave        it,
                                                              as       it
was impossible to approach        on account of the steepness of
                                  it
the mountain.       A Grulinian (Georgian) prince, whom the
czar sent lo meet us on the frontiers, promised, as soon as
the weather would permit, and the new snow should be
incited, to take proper care that the Ossetines in the next
village should bring up the box which remained whole, and
also collect the scattered plate which had fallen from the box
that had burst, and which could not fink into the old hard
ened snow, as    it   is strong even in summer as to bear the
                           so
weight of  a   horse.   On our return, indeed, one of the boxes
                                                                     with

with the plate was brought to us at Teflis, and all the plate
which had fallen from the broken one was again found, ex
cept fix gilt silver dishes, with one large and two dozen of
small silver spoons ; of the gold dessert service, seven knives
and some small dishes were recovered ; and, of the gilt, thir
teen knives and some forks *.
    Having again proceeded on our journey, we at length,
about one o'clock in the morning, after great pain and diffi
culty, on account of the snow, which was continually rolling
down from the mountain, arrived without further accident
at a village at the bottom of the ridge distant aboul eighteen
wersts, which had cost us eighteen hours labour from the village
where we had spent the preceding night.                 This village was
one of the poorest and most wretched in all Georgia ; but to
 us it was a welcome place of refrestiment, where we remained
 during our twentieth resting day, and, after three days journey
 more, arrived in safety on the 23d of January at Teflis, the
 capital of Georgia. This place we reached at midnight ; and
 though it was so dark that we could not fee a yard before us,
 we concluded from the dirt and narrowness of the streets,
 and from the disagreeable effluvia which assailed us from
 every corner, that, when day-light appeared, we mould find
 ourselves neither in a Berlin nor a Dresden : and this indeed
 was the cafe, as will appear from the following description.
     But we shall here first give a short view of the province of
 Tuoletti, which we traversed in our way from the snow moun
 tains to Teflis.       At about the distance of twenty-five wersts
 from the snow mountains the country begins to be exceed
 ingly pleasant, as the mountains gradually become lower, and
 are covered with wood to the tops.                 The valley along the
  river, which forms the principal passage from Russia to
  Georgia, still grows wider the nearer it approaches the ca
  pital ; so that, where the Aragui discharges itself into the
  Kur, which runs through Teflis, about twenty wersts from
  that city, the breadth of the valley is from five to seven
  wersts.      In other places its breadth varies from a half to a
  whole werst, and is every where interspersed with the most
  beautiful groves of beeches, chestnut, apple, and pear-trees.
  Between these fruit-trees vines shoot up, and the brush-wood
  is of that kind generally seen in Europe.                  Through this
  woody vale the Aragui flows in different branches, and the
  route in winter and the end of summer goes through the
  woods. No prospect more beautiful can be conceived than

that of the mountains on each side of this valley. At about
the half of their height lie in general the villages, which,
according to the Asiatic mode, are built with flat roofs.
Where any of the princes reside, the village is surrounded
with a high wall, strengthened by old round turrets. In
this manner, two or three villages often lie one above the
other, each having its gardens and fields laid out on the de
clivity of the mountain ; so that it appears wonderful how it
is possible to cultivate them.       Rivulets everywhere fall, in
the form of cascades, from the rocky brows of the mountain ;
and this district, in an amphitheatrical form, extends above
sixty wersts* with the most agreeable variety; so that a more
beautiful landscape can hardly be found either in Swisserland
or Italy.
   When compared with this beautiful neighbourhood, Teflis,
the capital, makes a Very poor appearance.           It is about eight
wersts in circumference, and is divided into two parts by the
river Kur, which flows through it. The principal part of
the town lies on the declivity of a high mountain, which ter
minates at the river with rocky banks of from eight to eleven
fathoms in height. On the land side it is inclosed by a wall,
built in the old form, eight fathoms in height, and at the
distance of every fifteen fathoms stands a large round tower
which supplies the place of a bastion. On this fide, the city
has three gates; and towards the mountain, which rises al
most perpendicularly behind the wall, it is protected by an
old cattle, which is exceedingly strong, and which exhibits
the true old method of building.            This castle is situated at
the elevation of at least two hundred fathoms above the level
of the city. The other part of the city is connected with
the former by means of a wooden bridge, which is only
twenty-five fathoms in length ; as the river Kur, though in
other places from a hundred to two hundred and eighty fa
thoms in breadth, is here confined on both sides by high
rocky banks, so that it never can become broader; audits
real breadth under the bridge amounts only to twenty fa
thoms.     This part of the city is fortified in the fame manner
as the former, and contains the czar's palace, a church, and
a few houses belonging to the citizens.            In the whole city
there are seventeen churches, Georgian and Armenian, with
one catholic church and three mosques.               The. number of
the houses in proportion to the extent of the ground is very
great, as the breadth of each house in front is only from four
to twelve fathoms. They are all irregularly built ; some of
them have neither windows nor chimneys, as the flat roof
                 * A  werst is about 4100 English feet.
         »                                                         has

rally takes place very soon. As the streets are not paved,
this snow occasions so much dirt, that to persons on soot they
are ahnost impafl'able.     Besides, carrion of every kind, such
as dead cattle, swine, dogs, cats, and the like, is thrown out
into the streets, where it is suffered to become .putrid.     Even
close to the czar's palace I observed the remains of a dead
cow, which emitted an intolerable stench, and would have
 long continued a nuisance had it not been devoured by the
dogs.      In winter the stench is not so offensive as in summer
during the great heats, when strangers are almost suffocated
by it; and on this account it is very surprising that pestilen
 tial diseases are not as prevalent inTeflisas at Constantinople.
 Strangers immediately on their arrival are sensible of the im
 purity of the air, and in consequence of it are continually
 sick. The healthiest time here is the autumn, because the
 strong winds which blow then from the mountains purify
 the air; but they would produce a much better effect if the
 city were regularly built, for at present the streets are too
 crooked and narrow to afford it a free passage.
      The czar's palace stands on the rocky bank of the river ;
 the lower part of it is built of stone, the upper is of wood
  and surrounded by a gallery; but in other respects it has a
  very mean appearance.       In the interior part it exhibits no
  thing remarkable; all its ornaments consist merely of rich
  and beautiful carpeting. The area before it is often so co
  vered with dirt that it is impossible to approach the palace.
  The magnificence of the court is, in my opinion, much in
   ferior to that which we observed at the court of the Persian
   chan Achmet Mehemet, at Eriwan ; who, however, is sub
  ject and tributary to the czar of Georgia. To describe the
   etiquette of the court would be too tedious and ridiculous;
   I shall therefore only observe, that prince Heraclius is a pru

   dent, intelligent, and courageous man, whose talents are dis
   played in his physiognomy.        He is of a middle stature, and
   still fresh and vigorous though seventy years old.      He has a
   great many children, the eldest of whom is forty-five years
   of age. The czar is exceedingly polite, and on days of fes
   tivity invites all the Ruffian officers to his table. I had twice
   this honour. We were served in the European manner ; the
   dishes however, for the most part, were cooked according to
   the Asiatic taste, but excellent of their kind.       On such oc
   casions the czar fits at table as the Europeans do, but in
   common he follows the Asiatic custom.
      The czar's consort and the princesses often appear publicly
  on festivals ; but some years ago they were more reserved,
  being seldom seen. The children are all stout and handsome.
      OF the Tartars subject to the czar of Georgia, and who are
  distinguished by the name of Kusacb, I obtained at Teflis the
  following information : — They reside on the rivers Nachatyr,
  Tebete, Kur, Achystaf, Pambek, and Algete.             On the first
  lie seven villages ; on the second, thirteen ; on the third, five ;
  on the fourth, fifteen ; on the fifth, eighteen ; and, on the
  sixth, two.     Some of these Tartars are of the sect of Omar;
  others are of that of Ali, and do not practise circumcision.
  They acknowledge, besides the Supreme Being, five saints.
  David, who had a hundred wives, and therefore Mahomet
 allowed his followers to have the fame number; Dschebrail,
 who, though invisible, excites the people to offer up their
 prayers to God ; Asrail, who by God's command sets the
 soul free from the body; Michael, who weighs the sins of
 the dead, and fends them either to hell or to paradise ; and,
 in the last place, Israfil, who, when God shall make the water
 like the earth, will sound the trumpet to call the dead to
judgment.        Mahomet they do not account a saint, but their
lawgiver, who has commanded them to pray five times in
 the twenty-four hours, and to implore God to forgive their
fins; to purify themselves before prayer by washing; to un
dertake a pilgrimage to his grave when possible ; not to steal ;
not to work on Friday, but to fast ; to observe the festivals, &c.
     They divide the year into twelve months, and assign to the
months an unequal number of days, which vary every year
except for the month Ramasan, which always consists of
thirty, and in which their principal festivals fall.          Their
week has seven days, and begins with Friday, which they
call Dschuta: the rest are, Dschuta-Ertesfi, Basar, Basar-J
Ertesfi, Chas, Tscharschembe, Perschcmbc.               They have
three grand festivals.      The first is in the month Ramasan ;
the second is called Kurban, and the third Naiuus-Bairam.
                                                             Their

  with her husband, pray in the church, nor perform any do
 mestic office.     Marriage is forbidden only between the first
 degrees of consanguinity, such as that of brother and sister;
 in all other degrees it is permitted.             A man may keep as
 many wives as he chooses : the first must always be a maid,
 but the rest may be widows.           If a married woman is guilty
 of adultery, the husband has a right to put her to death, as
 well as the adulterer.       Isa husband, however, is unfaithful,
 the wife has no resource. Men are accounted fit for marriage
  from the age of fifteen to fifty, and women from that of twelve
 to forty.     If a man loses all affection for his wife, he may
give her a letter of divorce and fend her away ; but a woman
 cannot separate from her husband without his consent.
     They bury their dead in the following manner : — The body
 is washed, and a mullah, or priest, is sent for to accompany it
 to the grave ; the mullah then recites some prayers, and the
 body being deposited in the grave the relations cover it with
earth. The relations do not return to the house of the de
ceased for three days, but at the expiration of that period
 they prepare an entertainment in honour of his memory;
and this festival is repeated on the seventh, and again on the
 fortieth day.
     During nine months of the year these people remain sta
tionary in their villages; but after the firll of July they retire
with their cattle to the river Tebete among the mountains,
where they lead a wandering life till the first of October. To
the flesh   of   deer, swine, and horses, they have an aversion.
Their language is a somewhat corrupted dialect of the Tartaric.
     A kind of borax, brought from Akalzi and Wan, is fold
at Teflis, for the use of the goldsmiths, under the name of
bora *. At Oldi, near the former of these places, about three
days journey from Teflis, and at Bajalid, near the latter,
there are said to be springs, the water of which is greenish.

It  is collected in stone cisterns,       where it is suffered to remain
three   or  four  months    witli (havings   of leather, Wood, and urine,
till it becomes putrid ; after which it is clarified, and boiled
in copper kettles. A concrete salt remains, which is the bora.
    After a residence of almost three weeks at Teflis, during
which time we put our equipage again into order, and pur
chased fresli cattle, we set out on the )2th of February, the
weather being then as mild as it is at I'etcr (burgh in the
spring.       In general, ice is seldom seen in the neighbourhood
of Teflis ; and the weather in winter is, for the most part,
rainy.       Some opinion respecting the climate of this country
may     be formed     from the fruit-trees, such as the pomegranate-
and fig-tree, which grow here in the open air in all the
gardens, and yet never suffer from the frost.
    We had to repass the mountains, but the road now was
not so dangerous. On the 17th we arrived at the bottom of
that height called the Bambakfche ridge. During these five
days we had an agreeable journey through a beautiful district
every where intersected bv small streams, and covered with
fruit-trees of every kind.           The inhabitants of this agreeable
district are, however, much to be pitied, as they are conti
nually exposed to the depredations of the Leighinians. In
the course of one day's journey we saw thirteen villages
which these plunderers had destroyed.                To such scenes of de
vastation the Georgians are often exposed, as the Leighinians
reside in the mountains between Kachct and Dagestan,                      and
are exceedingly numerous and warlike.                 The pacha of Achal-
ziche every year takes from two to three thousand of these
people into his service, but gives them little pay, as they re
ceive permission         from him to indemnify themselves in their
march by what they can plunder.                 To strengthen this corps-
 he unites with them some Turkish troops.                  Some time ago,
when three companies of our chasseurs, under the command
 of major Sengenberg, defeated the Lesghinians, of the two
thousand killed, one-half almost were Turks.                    On another
occasion, when four hundred remained on the field of battle,
 twenty Turks and two of their standards were brought into
 Teflis. Since that period the Leighinians have been afraid
 of our chasseurs; but the two battalions which we main
 tained in Georgia were not sufficient to defend it from these
 robbers *.
                                                                           On
    *  Since   that  period Georgia  has been annexed to the Russian empire.
 The   reasons   which produced this event will  be found in the following ex
 tract of a letter from Pctersourgh,   dated October 30, 1801 :
    " The manifvsto by which his      Imperial Majesty declares that Georgis,
                                                                         called

     Onthe 19th of February we pursued another route, in
order to avoid, in some measure, the snow mountains. This
route however was full 150 wersts longer, and exceedingly
called by the Russians Grusinia, is united to the crown, gives an account
of the motives that determined this measure. The sovereigns of Russia
have always considered it as a duty to protect that state : the withdrawing
of the Russian troops from it had occasioned every kind of disorder, and
tivil war had often burst forth. The barbarous tribes by whom it is
surrounded, threatened it on every side j and without the Russians it was
impossible to repress the banditti of Mount Caucasus. When the emperor
Alexander ascended the throne, he found Georgia united to the crown, in
 consequence     of a manifesto dated January 18, iSor.            However, as the
Russians had produced tranquillity in             it,
                                                 the emperor was desirous of trying
to restore to  it Its independence  ;    but this country had again to dread the
vengeance     of  those  who    had  been  excluded from the sovereignty — was           it
threatened with     a  new civil war.     The prince         whom
                                                            by        was governed

could not secure        it either internally or externally, and to all these cir
cumstances was added the wish of the Georgians themselves.                     Your '
hopes   this time,'   said the   emperor   to them,     shall
                                                        '

impose oh us the sacred obligation of listening to the voice of those who
suffer; and to establish in Giusmia           ajust government, which may ensure
the safety of persons and property, and the protecting force of the law.'
   " These are the intentions of our august monarch. The produce of the
taxes of Georgia will not go out of the country             ; will be consecrated to
                                                                 it

by  intestine war, and to the relief of the inhabitants.        Each will      main be

the princes will retain their estates, and may live where they please. Lieu

government; and in order that he may carry into ess.ct the instructions of
the emperor, he will associate with him other persons born in the country.
All the Georgians will take an oath of fidelity to their new sovereign, and
the ecclesiastics and pastors will be the first to give this example of sub
mission.

justice may prevail in the country      ;   that an end may be put to acts of vio

dangerous, as we were obliged to pass very near the Turkish
borders, which are generally infested by the Lesghinians.
    On the 23d we arrived at the village of Talin, which be
longs to Armenia the Less. Scarcely had we got to our
lodging when intelligence was received lhat 2000 Lesghinians
had crossed the river behind us, and attacked a village which
we passed a little time before.         Had we fallen in wilh these
 people  on  the road, our   silver plate must have been lost.
    On the 24th we came to the celebrated Armenian monastery
 of Weds, of Edsch-mijazin (seven churches), which is called
 also the Monastery of Ararat, where the Armenian patriarch,-
 the chief of the ecclesiastical establishment of that country, has
 his residence.    Here we were received with great hospitality,
lodged in an elegant apartment, and waited on with great
 attention.    Next day I made a drawing of the monastery,
 together with Mount Ararat and the neighbouring country j
 which pleased the patriarch so much when shown to him
 by our commanding officer, that he requested me to make a
 copy of it for him, and to encourage me to do so he gave me
a considerable   present.
         monastery is said to have been built upwards of 1300
      This
years ago, in the reign of an Armenian king named Tartat: and
beyond all doubt it is one of the richest in the world, as it re
ceives a great income from the Armenians scattered throughout
Turkey, Persia, Georgia, and even Europe; above 800 pea
sants also belong to       it,
                          and    large tract of land, on which
                                  a

the purposes of agriculture. When the patriarch dies,      new-

       is                             ;

 and the chan of Ispahan. The number of the monks amounts to

      On the 26th we continued our journey to Eriwan, which
 is   only fifteen wersts distant from the monastery.       This city
  lies in fruitful valley on the river Sangintschey, at the bot
             a
 tom of the snow mountains.           It  fortified

sour cannon : mortars also are planted on the edge of the
ditch by which the city is surrounded.          The city has only
one gate, and would be a place of strength if its situation
were more advantageous.       One-half of it is surrounded by
mountains within cannon shot ; but on the south side it is
protected by insuperable rocks, which extend, almost perpen
dicularly, to the banks of the river Sangin.           The houses
are in the fame style of architecture as those of Teflis:
   The chan, Achmet Mehemet, was about ten years of age,
and succeeded his brother, who had been assassinated in the
streets about a year before. The district belonging to Eriwan,
forms a great part of Armenia the Less : it is exceedingly fer
tile, and brings lo the chan a considerable income; from
which, however, he must pay a tribute to the czar of Georgia.
    On the 27th our colonel paid a visit to the chan, all ot us
accompanying him in great parade on horseback.              When
we arrived at the court of the palace we all dismounted, the
colonel excepted, who rode up to the palace, where he was
received bv one of the chan's vassals, who conducted him
into the hall of audience, to which all the officers followed
him.     Chairs covered with red cloth were handed to us;
after which we were presented with coffee, tea, and sweet
meats ; anil then with the kallian, a kind of machine used
for smoking tobacco through water.           The audience lasted
about half an hour, during which the chan spoke very little,
and of course we had no opportunity for much conversation.
When the audience was ended, we returned to our lodgings
in the chan's summer palace.       The streets through which we
pasted  were  so full of people,  that  it was with difficulty we
 could get along.
    On the 1st of March we continued our journev towards
Naohtichiwan, the capital of Armenia ; but when we arrived
at Denvischlar, sixty- nine wersts from Eriwan, we were
obliged, on account of the danger of the road, to return to
Eriwan, as the Curds along the river'Aras were in a state of
insurrection, and had already committed many acts of rob
bery. These Curds are a people nearlv in a savage state, who
lead a roving life among the mountains.          Their. habitations
consist of a kind of half tent made of a fort of hair cloth,
and which has a resemblance       to a piquet tent.     Such tents
are inhabited by whole families.       They  live chiefly on vege
 tables, and their dress is Turkish.
    On the 4th we arrived again at Eriwan, where we staid till

 W      HEN        the maw skin comes from the butcher, the chyly
matter     is   taken out, and the skin cleaned from slime and
every apparent impurity, by wiping or gently washing. The

down with the hand into the infusion.              The (kins are then
done with.       Mix those two infusions together, pass the liquor
through    a fine linen sieve, and add to the whole         quantity of     a

  It   is,
         we believe, generally admitted, that not only the
quantity, but the quality of the curd, as to texture, viz.
toughness or otherwise, depends in   great measure upon the      a
length of time the cheese    in coming; and that the time,
                                             is
again, depends on the quantity and strength of the coagulum
used, the state        of   the atmosphere,                  and the heat               of   the   milk
when put together.       In this stage of the art, where degree                               a
of accurate certainty seems to be required, there             no other                   is

thought to be about an hour and          half. The evening's milk

of suppose twenty cows having stood all the night           the cooler                  in
and brass pans, the cheesemaker in summer, about six o'clock
in the morning, carefully skims the cream from the whole of
it, observing lirlt to take otf all the froth and bubbles, which
may amount to about         pint; this, not being thought proper
                                    a
to be put into the cheese, goes to the cream-mug to be
churned for butter and the rest of the cream

Z$%               Account of the Process employed
or four gallons, which is immediately placed in the furnace of
hot water in the pan, and is made scalding hot ; then half of
the milk thus heated in the pan is poured also into the cheese-
tub, and the other half is poured to the cream, which, as
before observed, is skimmed into another brass pan. By this
means all the cream is liquefied and dissolved so as apparently
to form one homogeneous or uniform fluid, and in that state
it is poured into the cheese- tub ; but before this is done se
veral bowls or vessels full of new milk will generally have been
poured into the cheese-tub, or perhaps the whole morning's
milk. Care is taken to skim off all the air-bubbles which
may have formed in pouring the new milk into the cheese-
 tub.
     The rennet and colouring being put into the tub, the whole
is well stirred together, a wooden cover is put over the tub,
and over that is thrown a clean linen cloth.                 The usual time
 of coming is an hour and a half, during which time it is to
 be frequently examined : if the cream riles to the surface be
 fore the coming takes place, as it often does, the whole must
 be stirred together, so as to mix again the milk and cream,
 and this as often as it rises, until the coagulatiou commences.
 A few smart strokes on different fides of the tub with the
 cheese-ladder,     &c. will forward the coagulation, if it is found
 too long in forming.          If the dairy-woman supposes the milk,
 &c. to be accidentally put together cooler than she intended,
 or that its coolness is the cause of its not coming, hot water
 or hot milk may be poured into               it,  or hot water in    a  brass
 pan may he partially immerged therein               :      but this must be
 done before     it    at all coagulated
                      is                  ;    for, after that takes place,
  though but imperfectly,         itmust not be tampered with               so

  to break the forming curd, for           a     considerable part of the
  cream would thereby be directed into the whev, and the
  quantity of curd much lessened.                 Before the coagulation
  takes place, an additional quantity of rennet may also be put
  in, if thought necessary    ;    but this will, after coagulation, be
  added with little effect, as no meanacau be used lo mix              itwith
  the whole mass without disturbing the forming curd.                   If the
  cheese has been set together hotter than           it     was meant to be,
   the opposite  means,     under   the  fame precautions, may be re
   curred  to.   But   the  more general practice         is,   to suffer the
   process  to proceed    hot  as it is, until  the   first quantity of whev
 is   taken off;  a   part  of  which,   being    set    to cool,
                                                                is   returned
   into the tub to cool the curd.          When the cheese happens to
   come much sooner than          a proper time, owing to too great              a

f 11 the latter case, the curd is exceedingly tender : and, when
that so happens, a part of the whey is taken out of the cheese-
tub, and heated as much as may be thought sufficient to give

before observed, will be firm   in this cafe, the usual mode
                                                  :                                                   is

one inch     and again crossways in the fame manner, the in

cisions intersecting each other at right angles. The whey
rising through these incisions                        is   of    a    fine pale-green colour.
The cheese-maker and two                          assistants then proceed to break
the curd; this performed  is                          by
                              their repeatedly putting their

                                         If
the curd, as before mentioned, will be much more tender,
the whey will not be         green, but rather of milky appear

has recourse to the ikimming-dilh, the edge of which (he
holds perpendicular to the surface of the whey in the tub,
and dips it gently an inch or two into the curd, turning                                              it
over, until the whole surface         thus turned. The breaking

   The employment of the women is now drawing out and
putting in the skewers ; thrusting and keeping together the
portions of the curd, that the power of the weight or lever
displaces.   This operation is continued until the whey,
which at first ran from it freely, begins to be discharged by
drops; the weight and skewers are then removed, and one
woman takes up the comers of the cloth, while the others
break the curd halfway to the bottom of the vat, as small as
they can.
   Some people use a wooden or tin hoop, nine inches broad,
instead of holding up the corners of the cloth during this
breaking.     After the upper half of the cheese is thus broken,

   When no more whey can be extracted by the aforesaid
means, the cheese       again turned into the vat and rinsed, as
                               is

2$6                    Account   of the   Process employed
     As soon as the cheese is put into the press, it is well
 skewered; the skewers are of a strong iron wire, 18 or 20
 inches long, sharp at the points, and turned with a bow at
 the other end.      The vat and tin binder have holes to re
 ceive the skewers, especially the binder, which holes are sel
 dom more than one inch from each other. As the press stands
 close to a wall, only one side of the cheese can be skewered
 at a time; therefore as many skewers are stuck in different
 directions as conveniently may, leaving as many holes un-
 fkewered as are skewered, to give an opportunity of changing
 the holes.     The business of skewering continues till the next
 morning at six o'clock, and in that time the oftener they are
 sliifted the better ; every second time of shifting them the
 cheese is turned half way round in the press, to come at the
 other fide of it. In half an hour from the time the cheese is
 first put into the press, it is taken out again and turned in
 the vat into another clean cloth.     At this time the edges of
the cheese are pared off, if they have become sharp under the
press ; but as the vats are now usually made with the angles
rounded, the paring is rendered unnecessary, the vat being
wiped dry before the cheese is returned to it.
     When the cheese is thus the first time taken out of the
 press, it is the custom of some places to put it into warm, and
in others into hot whey, where it stands an hour or more.
It is then taken out, wiped dry, and after it has stood till
cool, it is returned back to the press. This is done with a
view to hardening its coat, that it may stand the better. At
fix o'clock in the evening the cheese is again turned in the
vat into another clean cloth. At this and the former turning,
some dairy-women prick the upper surface of the cheese all
over, an inch or two deep, before it is replaced under the
press, with a view of preventing blisters.       At fix o'clock in
the morning it is again turned in the vat, with a clean cloth
as before.      The skewers are now laid aside. When the next
day's cheese is ready for the press, the former one is again
turned in the vat with a clean cloth, and put under another
press.     At six o'clock in the evening, and at six the morning
following, it is again turned in the vat, using at these twa
last turnings two cloths finer than those before used, in order
that as little impression as possible from the cloth may remain
on the coat of the cheese.

and placed nearly midside deep in brine in a salting tub ; the
upper surface of the cheese being covered all over with salt.
It stands generally about three days in the salting tub; is
turned daily, and each turning well salted, the cloth being
twice changed in the time. The cheese is then taken out of
the vat, and in lieu of which a wooden girth or hoop is made
use of, equal in breadth nearly to the thickness of the cheese :
in this it isplaced on the salting-benches, where it stands
about eight days, being well salted all over, and turned each
day. The cheese is then waslied in luke-warm water; and
after being dried with a cloth, it is placed on the drying-
benches, where it remains about seven days: it is then
washed in warm water, as before, with a brufli, and wiped
dry with a cloth : after it has stood about two hours from
this washing, it is smeared all over with about two ounces of
sweet whey Dutter, and then placed in the warmest part of
the cheese-room.
                          Cheese- Room.
   During the first seven days it is rubbed every day well over,
and generally smeared with sweet whey butter.        Afterwards
a circular space is left unrubbed of four or five inches dia
meter, in the centre of each side the cheese, which, as long
as it is afterwards kept,    is,
                               or should be, turned daily, ana
rubbed three times   week in summer and twice in winter.

from rising. These cheese-rooms are commonly placed over

cattle underneath    supposed very much to contribute.

 rooms, the floors are mostly well littered with what the
 farmers here call sniddle, though wheat straw      is frequently
 made use of for this purpose, but the knots of    it  are apt to
 leave an impression on the cheese.     The afterneath of grass
 well dried seems to be  agood substitute for sniddle.

ilN           examination of the invention of forcing pumps
shall leave to those who may be disposed to write a history of
                                                                                     I
hydraulics;          I  shall however observe, that, on the testimony
of Vitruvius *, they are generally ascribed to Ctesibius ; that
on this account they are usually called machinæ Ctejibicæ ; and
that Ctesibius lived at Alexandria about the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes I. ; consequently, about
two hundred years before the Christian æra. My object here
is to lay before the reader what information                    I  have been able
to collect respecting the question, At what time did these ma
chines begin to be employed for extinguishing fires ?
     To render them fit for this purpose, it was necessary that
some alteration should be made in their construction, as at
first they were employed only                  in the raising of water. To
render them fit for extinguishing fires, it was necessary that
the water should be forced through the upper aperture to as
great a height as possible ; whereas, for the former purpose, it
is enough if it flows from the upper aperture in sufficient
quantity into the reservoir, from which it is to be conveyed
to the place of its destination.                  In this cafe, the apparatus
required for a machine to be used as a fire engine would be
a defect ; as the power which communicates to the water
its velocity might be employed with more advantage to raise
a larger quantity.
     In my opinion, it is highly probable that Ctesibius had an
 idea of converting his forcing pump into a fire engine; for
 his scholar Hero of Alexandria speaks expressly of this ap

                       On the Invention           of Fire Engines.                       239
  this application of the forcing pump soon became common,
, and whether the antient Roman8 were in possession of this
  useful machine.                All that I know on the subject is as fol
  lows :
       Pliny the younger informs the emperor Trajan in one of
  his letters, that the city of Nicomedia in Bithynia had been
  almost entirely destroyed by sire ; and that the devastation
  had been greater because a violent storm had taken place
  during the conflagration, and because there was no apparatus
  in the city for extinguishing sires*.                         The Jipbo here men
  tioned by Pliny seems, beyond doubt, to have been the fire
  engine or Ctesibius; though among the other articles we are
   to understand water conduits, and pipes employed for con
   veying water into the city.                   I must however confess that the
  word Jipbo signifies also pipes of this kind : and particularly
  in a passage of Strabo f, where he speaks of the subterranean
   conduits at Rome, and fays, that almost all the houses had
   cisterns, Jipbones, or water pipes, and running streams. But
   Pliny mentions at the fame time water buckets, which
   are to be considered as an appendage absolutely necessary to
   fire engines.           It is also hardly possible to believe that a city
   situated as Nicomedia was, close to a bay J, should be in
   want of water.
       But I can produce, and I believe I am the first to do so,
   for I do not find that it has ever been mentioned by any
   other writer, a very strong proof from a cotemporary author.

   Trajan in constructing the celebrated bridge on the Danube,

  340                                On the Antiquity and
  as we are told by Dio Cassius,                      was put to death by Trajan's
  successor, Adrian, on account                     of  a sneering answer which he
  gave to that prince, tells us,                    in  the remains of his work on
  warlike machines, what methods are to be employed when
  the upper part of an edifice is on fire, and the machine called
Jipbo is not at hand. In this cafe, fays he, leather bags filled
  with water must be fastened to long pipes in such a manner
  that, by pressing the bags, the water may be forced through
 the pipes and thrown on the place which is on fire *. The
Jipbo, therefore, was a machine by means of which water
  could be thrown to a height on places on sire, and which
  could not be reached in any other manner.
     That in the fourth century, at least, a fire engine properly
 so called was understood by the term Jiphoy is fully proved by
 Hesychiusf; as also by Isidore, who lived in the beginning
 of the seventh century %. The latter remarks, that such en
 gines were employed in the east for extinguishing fires ; and
 thence there is almost reason to conclude that they were not
 then used in the west.
     It now remains to determine the question, at what time
 such apparatus for extinguisliing fires began to be employed
 at Rome.           From the regulations for guarding against acci
 dents by fire, and in regard to extinguishing sires, which
 occur in the Roman code §, one might be induced to suppose
 that this capital must have been furnished with those neces
 sary machines, of the want of which, in a provincial city,

Pliny complains,       and which he had himself supplied.    This
conjecture, however,       I cannot confirm ; aud antient as well
as modern       examples prove that the police regulations esta
blished in small towns are not always to be found in capitals.
Antioch    and several cities had street-lanterns, which were
wanting   in  the proud Rome.     But what excites some doubt
 is,that these sire engines are never mentioned in the Roman
laws, nor       the accounts of the sires which frequently hap
                in
pened at Rome.            When      misfortune of this kind happens
                                    a
 al present,    it   ahvavs mentioned whether
                     is                                sufficient number

of engines were present, and what effect they produced             ;  and
 Pliny, indeed, does not omit them in the sliort account he
 gives of the fire at Nicomedia.
    One passage onlv in Ulpian             commonly produced as
                                              is                          a
 proof that, in his time, there were fire engines at Rome.
\Vhere he enumerates those things that belong to house             a
 when sold, he mentions, besides other articles, the Jipbones *
employed for extinguishing sires.             But        this term here
                                                              if
means       afire engine, the passage appears to prove too much;
for, in that cafe, we must believe that each house then was
furnished with an engine of its own                          if
                                                      so, these engines
                                                        :
must have been small portable ones, such as are common in
many houses at present          ;and the passage therefore cannot be
adduced as      a  proof of public engines, such as Pliny regrets
the want of at Nicomedia.             But         npre probable that
                                                   it   is
Ulpian only alludes to those Jipbones which according to
Strabo's account were to be found in every house at Rome;
that   is,pipes which conveyed water into them for domestic
purposes.        From the total want of fire engines, or the im
perfect manner in which they were constructed, what Seneca
fays must have been very true, that the height of the houses
at Rome rendered          itimpossible to extinguish the fires which
happened in that citv          t-That the houses there were exceed
ingly high, and the streets, bridges, and highways, very nar-

    242                              On the Antiquity and
    row, is well known.       Archenholz * and others are of opi
    nion, that the houses were raised to such a height on account
    of the great heat in that warm climate; hut the principal
    cause was that assigned by Vitmviusj, and which still pro
    duces the fame effect.       For want of room on the .earth, the
    buildings were extended towards the heavens ; so that at last
    the greatest height of an edifice was fixed by a law at 7c,
    and afterwards at 60 feet.          In Hamburgh at present, where
    ground    is valuable,  and   still   becoming more so, most of the
    houses are 60 feet, and some 70 feet in height; and how
    much this height, notwithstanding the perfection to which
    fire engines have been brought, renders the extinguishing of
    fires difficult, and often impossible,       is shown by the melan
    choly   instance   of  Gera,   where     the   houses are built lower.
    With Neubert's engine, which was tried at Hamburgh in
     1769, eight fire-men raised 1 1 4- cubic feet of water to the
    height of about 62 or 63 feet. The best English engines can
    throw water to the height only of from 32 to 33 feet %•
        In the East, such engines were employed not only to ex
    tinguish fires, but to excite conflagrations.         The Greek fiie,
    invented in the year 678, by Calliuicus, an architect of He-
    liopolis, called afterwards Balbec, the use of which was con
    tinued in the East till the year 1291 at least §, and which
    certainlv was liquid         was employed in many ways, but

    engines, into the stiips of the enemy. Sometimes this fire was
    kindled in certain vessels which might be called sire Jl/ips,
     and which were introduced among the hostile fleet               some    f;

    projecting it from the fore part of ships against those of the
    enemy. They were constructed of copper aud iron ; the ex

244                            On       the   Antiquity and
In my opinion      they had regulations respecting fires before
they had engines; and the former do not seem to be older
than the beginning or middle of the sixteenth century.         The
oldest for the city of Franckfort on the. Mayn, with which I
am acquainted, are of the year 1460*. The first general order
in Saxony respecting fire, is that of duke George in the year
1521s. The first for the city of Dresden, and which was
to serve for the whole country, is of the year 1529 J.           In
many cities, the first ordinances published by government for
the purpose of preventing danger from fire, may be found
perhaps among the regulations in regard to building, which
appear to be somewhat older than the particular ones respect
ing fires. At Augsburg an express regulation in regard to
building was drawn up and published so early as 1447 §.
On turning over the old chronicles it is observed that great
fires began to be less frequent in the sixteenth century ; a
circumstance which beyond all doubt must be ascribed to the
improvements in building           the regulations made
                                                  ||,           go                     by
vernment for the guarding against fires, and the introduction
of apparatus for extinguishing them. But             the invention      by
of sire engines every thing in this respect has been so much
changed, as to render        necessary to revise and entirely alter
                                    it
the old regulations made                  in
                                regard to fires  and       not im   ;        it   is
possible that the first mention of public fire engines will occur
in the new regulations respecting sires made in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.
    Mr. Von Stelten has remarked, that the first mention of
sire engines at Augsburg occurs in the building, accounts
of the citv for the year 1518.       They are called there instru
ments for fires, water syringes useful al fires          and these           51

names seem to announce that the machine was then in its
infancy.    At that time they were constructed            Anthony             by
Blatner,     goldsmith of Friedberg, but who in the above

year was       citizen of Augsburg.

the account, there is reason to conclude that these were not
hand engines, but larsre compound machines.                        In that re
spectable dictionary ALia/ers Teulscbfpraach, printed at Zu
rich in 1,561. 8vo., I find feuerbakcli (fire hooks), "andyiv/tr-
icilern (fire ladders) ; but no machines for extinguishing
fires, nor any where a fire engine.
    In the year 1655 tne jesuitTCaspar Schott was struck with
admiration on seeing at Nuremberg an engine, made there
by John Hautsch.            It stood on a fledge ten feet in length
and four in breadth.            The vessel that contained the water
was eight feet in length, four in height, and two in breadth.
It was put in motion by twenty-eight men, and forced a
stream of water an inch in diameter to the height of eighty
feet, and consequently above the houses.                    The whole ma
chine was drawn bv two horses.                     Hautsch is said to have
caused an engraving to be made of this machine, which he
circulated, with an offer of constructing similar ones at a
moderate price, and teaching the use of them.                       He refused
to stiow Schott the internal construction of his machine;
 but the latter readily conceived it. From what Schott fays,
it evidently appears that the cylinders did not stand perpen
dicular, but lay in a horizontal direction in the box ; so that
 the pistons moved horizontally,               and not vertically as at pre
 sent.     Vertical cylinders, therefore, seem to be among the
 improvements since made to this engine. Schott adds, that
 this invention was not new, it had been known in other
 cities; and he himself forty years before, consequently                      in
 1617, had seen one, but much smaller, in his native city".
 Schott, as is well known, was born at Konigfhofen, not far
 from Wiirzburg, in 1608.                George Hautsch, the son of the
 former artist, constructed such engines also; and probably
 made some improvement in them ; for Wagenseil                          f   and
 others ascribe to him the invention.
    The first regulations at Paris respecting sires, as far as is
 known, relate to suppressing those incendiaries who, under
 the name of loutefeux, occasioned great devastation in the
 capital as well as in the provinces %•                Paris seems to have
 obtained the first fire engines in 1699 : in that year, at least,
 the king gave to Dumourier Duperrier an exclusive privilege

246                         On   the Antiquity and
to construct these machines, which were called pompes por
tative ; and he engaged for a certain sum to keep in repair
the seventeen engines which had been purchased for the use
of the city, and to provide and pay the necessary workmen.
In the year 1722 the number was increased to thirtv, which
were distributed in several quarters of the city ; and the con
tractors received annually at that time 20,000 livres.              The
city, however, besides the thirtv royal engines, had others
which belonged to the hotel de vi/le, with which the fieur
Duperrier had nothing to do *.
    In the middle of the sixteenth century these machines
were certainly (till very imperfect.            They had neither an air
chamber nor buckets, and required a great many men to
work them. They consisted onlv of a sucking pump and for
cing pump united, which forced the water out in spurts, and
with continual interruptions.            Such machines in moving the
lever experience a stoppage, during which no water is forced
out ; ^and, as the pipe is fixed, it cannot convey the water
into a house on fire, though it mav reach a sire at no great
distance where there arc doors and windows to afford it a
passage.        At the fame time, the workmen are liable lo be
crushed by the fall of the houses, and on that account must
keep from them.             Uautlch, however, had given to his en
gine    a  flexible    pipe, which could be turned to any side as
might     be    necessary; but not an air-chamber, which Schott
certainly would have described.             Kven in Bclidor's time, the
lire engines in France were of no other kind.                In the year
 1760    these     improved     machines   were  used only in  England ;
at least professor Bnsch |- concludes so from this circumstance,
 that Ferguson considers Newsham's engine, which threw the
water out in a continued stream, as a new invention.
    It is not with certainty known who first conceived the
idea of constructing an engine with an air-chamber,                   in
 which the included air, by compressing the water, forces it
 out in a continued stream.              According to a conjecture of
 Perrault, it would appear that Vitruvius seems to speak of a
 similar construction ; but Perrault himself acknowledges that
 this obscure passage \ can fie explained in a different manner.
 The air-chamber in its action has however some resemblance
 to Hero's fountain, in which the air, being compressed by
 the water, forces the water out §.

    Ican find no older engine with an air-chamber than thai
described  bv Perrault, and of which he has given a figure.
He fays it was preserved in the king's library' at Paris; that
it was employed tor throwing the water to a great height
during (ires; that it had only one cylinder, and yet threw
out a continued jet of water. He neither mentions the pe
riod of the invention, nor the name of the inventor ; and I can
only add that- his book was printed in 1684*. The principle
however seems to have been pointed out before by ftjariotte,
who by some           is,
                      on this account, considered as the inventor;
but he does not appear to have entertained any idea of sire                           a

 added to the engine, which can be lengthened or shortened,

both named John van der Heide*, who were inspectors of
the apparatus for extinguishing sires at Amsterdam. The first
public experiments made with them took place in the year
1672, and were attended with so much success, that al'a sire
next year the old engines were used tor the last, and the en
gines with moveahle hose for the first, time. In the vear 1677
the inventor obtained an exclusive privilege to construct en
gines according to their principle for twenty-five years.     In
the year 1682 a sufficient number of these engines    were  dis
tributed in the different quarters of the citv, and the old en
gines were entirely laid aside.     In the year 1695 there were
in Amsterdam more       than  sixty of these engines, the six of
which nearest the place where a fire broke out, were required
to be present            to give             assistance.         In    a few    years they were
common in all the towns of the Netherlands.
   All these circumstances have been related by the inventor
himself in a particular work, which, on account of the ex
cellent copper-plates in                      it,
                               has become exceedingly scarce                                       f.
The first seven of these represent some dreadful conflagrations,
at which the old engines were used without producing much
effect.  Among them          the conflagration of the fiadt-houfe
                                          is
of Amsterdam in the vear 1652. The twelve following plates
are representations of sires which were extinguished          means                       by
of the new engines, and exhibit at the fame time the various
ways in which they could be employed with advantage.
According to an annexed account,          appears that the city of
                                                              it
Amsterdam lost        ten sires, at which the old apparatus was
                               by
used, 1,024,130 florins; but during the ten following years,
when the new engines were introduced, only 18,355 were

Jponting engines*.        The description even of the leather pipe,
or hose, is very short and defective ; probably with a view
to render it difficult to be imitated : it is only said that it was
made in a peculiar manner of leather; so that it was not
only thick, but could withstand the force of the water-)-.
    The convever or brinsrer was invented also in Holland
about the same time. This name is given at present to a
box which has on one fide a sucking pump, and on the other
a forcing pump.        The former serves to raise the water from
a stream, well, or other reservoir,      by means of a stiff hose,
the extremity of which is furnished with a metal strainer to
prevent dirt from entering                 it,
                                      and which                     is
                                                       kept suspended
above the mud             means of
                            by         piece of cork.
                                                 a        The forcing
pump forces the water thus drawn up, through another hose,
into the engine, and thus renders unnecessary the labour of
 supplying  it  with water by means of buckets.
    At first, indeed, this machine was very simple.           consisted       It
 of leather hose screwed upon the engine, the end of which
   a
 widened into       kind of bag supported near the reservoir, and
                 by a
                   means of
kept open                       frame; and the labourers poured
                                      a
 water into  it  from buckets. The Van der Heides, however,
 had for this purpose employed           pump which they called
                                                  a                                  a
fnr.ke  pump,   and      which
                            by   they could  raise the water upwards
 of thousand feet. But how
   a                                    was constructed
                                                 it          no where     I
 find mentioned       from the figure,
                        :                  should almost conjecture
                                                      I
 that they used only       cylinder with

 water into the annexed hose, which conveyed                to the en     it

 called a   •water J'ndke and these were not made, as the hole

  into it no water. It is here seen that the use of sail-cloth
  hose is not so modern an invention as some have supposed.
  That our apparatus for conveying water to the sire engine is
 much more ingenious and convenient must be allowed ; but
  I would strongly recommend that in all cities there should
  be pumps or running wells of water, to the spout of which
  the one end of hose might be fixed, while the other is
  screwed upon the engine. The Van der Heide reckoned it an
  advantage in their invention, that this apparatus rendered it
  unneceilary to have leathern buckets, which are expensive; or
 at least lessened their nurnber, as well as that of the workmen.
     From this information, the truth of which cannot be
  doubted, we may readily believe that engines with hose were
  not invented in the year 1697 by Gottfried Fuchs, fire di
  rector at Copenhagen, as was however publicly asserted in
  1717; with this addition, that the invention was soon after
 employed in Holland and at Hamburgh *. Fuchs seems
  only to have introduced into Denmark the invention of the
 above Dutchmen at the time of the great sire on the 19th of
 April 1689, when tlle opera house at Amalicnburg, with
 more than 130 persons, as well as the beautiful palace of
 Amalicnburg, were destroyed.                    We are at least told in his
 tory)-, that this event gave rife to an improvement in the ap
 paratus for extinguishing fires, and to a new ordinance of
 the 23d of July of that year respecting fires, as well as to the
 introduction of sire engines with bole; which however had
been employed at Amsterdam more than a dozen of years
before.
     Hose or pipes of this kind for conveying water were not,
 however, unknown to the antients.                         The architect Apollo-
 dorus, at least, fays, in the passage already quoted, that to
 convey water to elevated places exposed to fiery darts, instead
 of pipes, the bowels of an ox might be employed, having at
the one end a bag silled with water, which being compressed,
the water will be forced through the intestines to the place of
its destination %• These were conveyers of the simplest con
struction.

                Description   of a new Eleclrometer.                      251
  Among       the newest     methods of improving the hose of fire
tmgines, is that of weaving them without a seam.        In the
year 1720 some of this kind were made at Leipsic, of hemp,
by one Beck, a lace-weaver, as we are told by Leopold in his
before-mentioned account of fire engines, printed in that year.
After this they were made also by Erk, linen-weaver at Wei
mar; and at a latter period they were made of linen at Dres
den, and also in Silesia '. At present, Gegncr and Plhrliholzer
have a manufactory at Bethnal Green f, where they make
water-tight hose without seams. Assessor Mogling has caused
some of the same kind to be manufactured on his estate near
Stuttgard on a loom invented by himself, and which arc now
used on many of the towns of Wurtemberg J.          I (hall here
take occasion to mention a kind of loom on which Braun
caused shirts without seams to be wove,        similar to those
sometimes brought from India as curiosities, and of which
he gave a particular description, with an engravings.
   I shall in the last place observe, that notwithstanding the
belief of the Turks in predestination, the use of fire engines
has been lately introduced at Constantinople bv Ibrahim
Effendill.

a battery at the same time.      The instrument known by the
name of Cuthbertson's discharging electrometer was at that
time the best, and indeed the only instrument for discharging
batteries or jars by its own action, then made ; but I think
this will be found in the essentials, and in the theory and use,
 a more perfect instrument.
   On the base S (tig. I. Plate       VI.) is fixed the glass pillar G,
  supporting the hollow brass ball B. T, is a light graduated brass
  tube divided (from the weight W towards the ball B) into thirty
  parts, representing grains. W, is a sliding weight. L, a light
  brass ball screwed to the end of the tube T, on the other end
  of which tube adjusts the heavy counter balance-ball C, the
 tube T and its two balls being suspended at their common
  centre of gravity by a silk line in the centre of the ball B, the
 mechanism of which is shown in fig. 2. The brass ball F is
 stationary, and of the fame size as the ball L, and is fixed by
 a brass arm to the ball B.        The adjusting ball A is also of the
 fame size, and adjusts close to the ball L, or at any lower station
 between that and the ring r. The brass tube to which the ball A
 is fixed is divided into inches, halves, and quarters: (a more
 minute division is unnecessary and improper.)            The divisions
 begin,   or the  o Jine  is marked,   on the said  tube  at the ring r,
 when the three balls A L F are close together.              The ring r
 serves as an index, as the divisions pass in succession into the
 glass tube P on lowering the ball A. / The hook H is screwed
 into the base of P. The quadrant, or Henley's electrome
ter, Q, is supported on a long brass stem to keep it out of the
 atmosphere      of the lower part of the instrument.            Fig. 2.
 shows the internal construction of the ball B, fig. 1.          In the
 first place, the ball screws in half, horizontally.          The light
tube T passes through the ball, and is suspended nearly in the
centre of it by some silk twist        ~s,  which small silk twist   is
fixed into the eye of the adjusting wire a, part of which wire
is   filed square and goes through the square hole             h.   The
nut n screws on a, and serves to adjust the light tube          T   ver
tically.      The light plates PP are of copper, and move
freely on the wire w <w somewhat like          a   hinge, and rest on
the copper wires CC, serving to make the direct communi
cation between the inside and out of the battery or jar.
N JV are notches serving to let the tube descend when the
                                              T
discharge   is made. Into the tube    Z    the glass pillar
                                                          is   ground.
Note, that at the bottom of the notch N            is
                                                   a     piece of brass
filed with  a  Y, and   so    placed as to keep the centres of the
balls  L   and   F, sig. 1, under  each other when they come close
together.

    When the instrument is adjusted, which is done bv placing
the weight W, fig. 1, at o on the line of grains, and then
screwing or unscrewing the counterbalance ball C, till the
tube T rises slowly into its horizontal position ; then set the
ball A at the distance from the ball L that you choose, and
the weight W placed at the division or number of grains that
vou wish the repulsive power of the electricity to arrive at
before the discharge is made : this being done, connect the
battery or jar with the ball B by means of the wire^y, the
end of which goes into B at the hole X, and should stand at
right angles to B, the ball of y resting on the battery : then
connect the outside of the battery or jar with the hook H;
as the battery charges, the electrometer Q. continues to rife;
and when it is so highly charged that the repulsive power be
tween the balls L and F is equal to the number of grains at
which the weight W was placed, the ball L will descend, and
deliver the charge of the battery to the ball A. The substance
or thing through which the sliock is intended to be passed,
mull form part of the communication between the hook H
and the outside of the battery or jar.
    It is evident, from considering the instrument, that it is
attended with these excellences; that, the whole being com-
         the electric atmosphere    must be so also; that it has
Eact,

connection of their links (especially if long), very often, and
without being suspected, hinder the success of many very
well concerted experiments.
XLII.      Description of an improved Chemical Apparatus for
    preserving separate the Gaseous Producls evolved in many
    Processes ; by which also Absorption is completely prevented,
    and Liquids may be ' /Iromr/y impregnated with the different
     Gases.    By W'. H. Fe p v's jun. Esq.   »
   X   HE chemist, in his various researches into the compo
 sition and qualities of the numerous substances presented by
Nature, had long to regret the want of an apparatus capable
                     * Communicated by the Author.
                                                                of

  254                Improved Chemical Apparatus
 of preserving all the gaseous as well as liquid products evolved
 from them miring his experiments. The apparatus invented
 by Woulfe, and which will immortalize his name, was the
 first, and indeed may be said to be the only one yet made
known, calculated at all to answer so desirable an end : but
 it had defects ; and though some of them have been removed
by subsequent improvements, still it has its imperfections.
Every chemist will readilv perceive that I b»ve in my eye the
 inconvenience experienced on changes of temperature : if ab
 sorption take place between the retort and receiver, a portion
 of liquid from the first Woulfe's bottle rustics into the re
 ceiver; or, if the tube of Welter is used, an undetermined
quantity of atmospheric air finds admiflion to supply the va
 cuum thus formed.
    To obviate these inconveniences, in a train of experiments,
in which I was engaged in the year 1798, on the oxymuri-
atic acid and its compounds, after thinking of different con
trivances, it struck me that I mould be able to accomplish
what I had in view, bv procuring; an adaptor, mounted with a
glass valve (similar to that used in the improved Nooth's ap
paratus), and, at the end furnished with the valve, ground
into a tubulated receiver ; and then, by means of a bent tube,
connecting the upper opening of the adaptor with a series of
Woulfe's bottles. By means of this apparatus, which was
executed agreeably to my instructions by Mr. Blades, I was
enabled to form the purest oxvmuriates without the smallest
risque of any accident from absorption.
    By another modification of the apparatus, in which the
woulfes were dispensed with, I obtained some of the finest
crystals of oxymuriate of poiasti I have ever seen, without
the smallest portion of eas escaping — a circumstance of no
small moment; oxymunatic gap, as every one knows, being
extremely noxious.          In this arrangement, two additional
adaptors     were   joined to the one ground into the receiver
and    furnished   with   the valve as already mentioned ; and the
uppermost adaptor        was  furnished with a tube leading into a
pneumatic apparatus ;        or,  when the redundant gas was not
to   be   preserved,   into  a chimney.     By employing the appa
ratus   in  this form,   every   bubble of  gas has to pal's through
the three adaptors, and experiences a considerable agitation
along with the liquor employed in them ; the gas forcing the
liquid from the lowest into the second, and from that into
the uppermost adaptor, — till, a portion os it being taken up
bv the fluid, and the lower orifices of the upper adaptors
being at times left quite free, the liquid, following the com
mon law of gravity, returns to occupy again the lower sta
                                                                tion.

lion.      When      there is a quick and plentiful supply of gas,
the whole       of the liquid is kept in continual motion, offering
thereby a proportionally large surface for impregnation, when
that is the object in view; as when it is wished, for instance,
 to impregnate water very highly with ammoniacal cas pro
 cured from the sulphate or muriate of ammonia oy lime.
 The quantity of liquid employed at one time in the adaptors
 should be about sufficient to fill the lowest one full, and the
 middle one about a third part.
     The apparatus of which I have been speaking, which is
 less expensive       than ground woulfes, not so easily injured,
 and more readily replaced when any part is fractured, I have
 found so extremely useful, and applicable to so many pur
 poses, that I persuade myself such a description of it as wHl
 enable any one to get it constructed, will be acceptable to
 many.       United with a series of woulfes, it forms one of the
 completest apparatuses that has yet been devised for a great
  variety of chemical experiments ; for it is not proposed t«
 superlede the woulfes : indeed, when gaseous products are
 intended to he pasted through a variety of liquids, they will,
 in many cafes, be found indispensably requisite *. I shall
  take the present opportunity,          now that we are speaking of
  Woulfe's apparatus, of mentioning a few circumstances
  which, having found useful myself in constructing a series
  of woulfes, mav prove equally so to others.
     Lavoisier frequently regretted the want of a perfect \Voulfe*s
  apparatus, the usual method of manufacturing which is by
   grinding the tubes to fit the bottles after the tubes have been
  I>ent: from this circumstance it generally happens that the
  bottles have no equal standing, but are obliged to he accom
  modated to the bend of the tubes and the titling of the necks
  by means of wedges and supports put under the bottles, which
  continually expose* the tubes to the risque of being broken
  during the adjustment of the parts.           To remedy this inconve
  nience, when I want tubes, I cause them to he ground to sit
  the woulfes while straight (See A, tig. 4. Plate \ II.); I then
  bend them into two angles of about 130^ or 140 , just above
  the ground stopper parts (See B, sig. 4.) : then taking the
  two bottles to which the tube has been ground, and placing
     * In o'hcr casis. however, even where gases arc to rals through differ
  ent liquids, they could be dispensed with, if, as Mr. Chc-n-.vix suggested
  when 1 showed him the apparatus, a set of adaptors were provided, each
  furnished with a Valve, like the lowest adaptor, instead of the bent lube now
  attached to. them.    The gis evolved might by this means be made to psss
  through any numher of adaptors, which would lave all the trouble attend
  ing glass tubes.   1 tie valves, however, would considerably increase the
  expense.
                                                 3                        them

 them on a true plane, and heating the tube, as exactly as
 I  can in the centre between these angles, I there form a third
 angle (C, fig. 4.) while the glass is soft and yielding *,
 making it to accommodate itself to the ground necks, in
which it is left without being moved for about a quarter of
an hour to cool thoroughly.                If moved too soon, the tube is
apt    to  alter  its  form.      In   this  manner, tubes may be bent,
one at a time, for a range of any extent ; and when arranged
afterwards on any plane surface, will always be found to fit.
     I  shall here mention a kind of tubes which I have found
extremely convenient on many occasions : I mean tubes
made of elastic gum or caoutchouc.                  They are composed of a
web or tube of wove cat-gut, coated outside and inside with
elastic-gum varnish. They stand the action of most of the
           Ether, alcohol, or oils, however, would destroy them,
   'he accommodation they yield is very great; as the woulses
fases.
may be agitated or moved in any direction, and mav be
placed on the most uneven surfaces.                  These tubes are fitted
into corks previously impregnated with wax or tallow ; and
when they are to be made use of, I first put a ring of elastic-
gum (a neck of a gum bottle) over each neck of the woulfe,
but so as to stand aJittle higher than the glass, forming a
kind of wall round the cork and tube, to receive melted wax,
or lute, to secure them in their places.
                 Description     of the improved Apparatus.

may still pass unabsorbed either into a pneumatic apparatus

of the adaptor.          It consists of an internal tube of small ca
libre but pretty stout in substance, and ground into an exte
 rior tube closed at the upper end, but perforated with several
small holes to allow the gas to pass.               After the internal tube
is ground to fit the external, a portion of it is cut out (as at a)

and cotton-wick      is sufficient tor the purpose.  When the tubes arc thick
J prefer a cliarcopl fire made in a bl<ick lead crucible, across which the
tubes may be easily heated to the required degree.         Whichever of these
methods be followed, the heat should not be applied too suddenly ; nor
should the tubes be blown upon, or exposed to a low temperature, to cool
them hastily, as by such treatment they are apt to fly.
                                                                   sufficient

sufficient to receive a small hemisphere os glass, and to allow
the hemisphere to rise a little in its small chamber, but not
to turn over in it.    The upper piece of the internal tube is
then thrust home to the place in which it is to remain, and
the glass hemisphere introduced, with its plane incumbent on
the upper end of the lower piece of the internal tube, which is
   round perfectly flat, as is also the plane of the hemisphere.
f  Yom the construction, it is obvious that, by the upward
pressure of any gas, the glass hemisphere may be raised so as.
to allow the aeriform fluid to pass into the adaptor, but that
there can be no return of any thing into the receiver even
when a partial vacuum takes place in it; and the greater the
excels of the expansive force or pressure exerted at any time
in the adaptor over that maintained in the retort and receiver,
the closer does the valve become.

 XLHI.       Life of Joseph Toaldo,          Professor of Astronomy
                     and Meteorology at Padua.
 *) OSEPfl TOALDO,              whose merit as a philosopher and
 meteorologist is well known in all the civilized countries of
 Europe, was born on the j ith of July 1719 at San Lorenzo
 di Pianezza, a small village near Marostica, at the foot of
 the Alps, in the valleys of Vicenza.          The first part of his
  education he received from various ecclesiastics, who gave
  him an early taste for the sciences, and accustomed him to
  diligence and application.       In the year 1733 he was sent to
  the seminary of Padua, where he studied Latin, rhetoric,
  philosophy, and theology, but in particular the mathema
  tics.   Here he took the degree of doctor of theology, and
  was destined for the place of a teacher in the same institution
  in which he had been instructed. About this peri'xl he
  began to distinguish     himself as a writer.     The first literary
  labour he engaged in was a new edition of the works of Ga
  lileo, to which he added various fragments never before pub-
      Vol. XL                       K                          lifted,

limed, together with annotations and a preface.           This edi
 tion contained also the celebrated dialogues respecting the.
 system of the world.     As one of the masters of the above
 seminary, lie taught grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and
 mathematics; ana here he first introduced the infinitesimal
 calculus according to the principles of his preceptor Suzzi,
 one of the most celebrated analysts of Italy.       His services to
 this establishment were soon rewarded by the archbishop with
 the benefice of Montegalda, which he enjoyed for fourteen
 years.     Though this place engaged a great deal of his atten
 tion, it allowed him sufficient leisure for continuing his ma
 thematical studies, which, on account of the different occu
 pations of his academical office, he had not been able to
 pursue with that attention which he wislied.          He however
 exchanged this    benefice  for  another  more  convenient,    alter
 he had Deen invited by the senate of Venice, in the year 1762,
 to take upon him the vacant professorsliip of astronomy and
 meteorologyjn the university of Padua.
     In this institution he found it necessary to make a great
 many changes in order to render his instruction useful. The
 first thing to be done, according to the system which he pro
 posed, was to erect an observatory.      The curators of the uni
 versity complied with the request which he made on this sub
ject, and intrusted to him the care of drawing up the plan
 and superintending the construction of the building.            On
 this account he undertook a tour through Italy for the pur
 pose of inspecting the principal observatories,     that he might
 be better able to devise a plan for that of Padua.             Tl>e
 foundation of this observatory was laid in the year 1767, and
 in 1774 it was completed.       He now procured an excellent'
 quadrant from England, which he employed for making ob
 servations in conjunction with his nephew and assistant Chi-
 minello.     To supply the want of good elementary books he
 published a short view of plane and spherical trigonometry,
 with tables, under the title of Tavole Trigonometricbe, con
 vna Introduzione, que conticne un Compendia di Trigort',nniria
 piano, e Jpberica, applicata alia Pralica, cen molte altre Ta-jule;
 Padua 1769. 4-to.; which was afterwards reprinted and in
 troduced into many of the Italian seminaries.
     This work was soon followed by another on the influence
 of the heavenly bodies on the weather and atmosphere ; which
 greatly contributed to extend his fame as a philosopher, and
 which contained the result of a long series of meteorological
observations made by him.         The original title is, Delia vera

  Padua 1770. 4to. This work, which made the author known
  throughout all Europe, was translated into different languages,
  and procured for him admission into various learned societies.
  About the fame time he published some essays in favour of
  electrical conductors, many of which, in consequence of his
  recommendation, were erected in the Venetian territories :
  also a chronological view of uncommon changes in the wea
  ther, with tables of the state of the barometer, and flux and
  reflux of the sea.   In the year 1773 he began his meteoro
 logical journal, which he continued till his death.           In the
 year 1774 his celebrity was still further increased by his an
 swering a prize question, proposed by the Academical Society
 of Montpellicr, on meteorology as applied to agriculture;
 which was crowned by the above society, and printed in Ro-
 zier's Journal de Pbjjiaue.       It was translated in almost every
 country of Europe, and, together with the author's preceding
 work, excited general attention to a study which before had
 been much neglected : this paper contributed also, in a con
 siderable degree, to the establishment of the Meteorological
 Society of Manheim.       After this period the author continued
 with great zeal to exert himself in diffusing meteorological
 knowledge, and in improving meteorologicaV instruments;
 and in 1776 he published, in the Economical Journal of
 Venice, an extratt from De Luc's Treatise on the Barometer
 and Thermometer, bv which the construction of these instru
 ments was much facilitated. Next vear (1777) he translated
 Lalande's Astronomical Tables and his Abrege de V Astrono
 mic, as he did afterwards his Ajlronomie des Dames ; and he
 erected a marble bust of that eminent astronomer in the ob
 servatory.    After this time his attention was exclusively di
rected to astronomy and meteorology, and he in particular
 endeavoured to confirm more and more his doctrine respecting
 the influence of the moon on the different changes of the
 weather, lie published also an historical view of the ser
vice rendered bv the Venetian schools lo astronomy, geo
graphy, and navigation.        In the vear" 1783 he obtained, in
 conjunction   with  his nephew Chiminello,       from the academy
of Manheim, the prize for the best treatise on the construc
tion of a comparative hvgrometer; and in 1784 he published
a small work on finding the longitude, De Metbodo Longi-
tudhium, et Obfervatione Tmnjits Lunœ per Meridian um;
which was much approved, particularly in England.              From
this period he wrote nothing except his journal till the year

                          Life of  Joseph  Toaldo.
Tavole di Vital'tta, a small but laborious work, was printed
next year at Padua and Venice.
     In the year 1788 he undertook a third tour * to Rome,
Naples, Trieste, and Tuscany ; during which he examined
the place where Hannibal crossed the Alps, and wrote a
          on this subject, which was inserted in the fourth vo-
fiaper
  ume of the Transactions of the Academy of Padua, of
which he had been a member from the time of its establish
ment. Next year he introduced the French clocks at Padua,
and published a treatise on gnomonics, and respecting Jchc-
diasmata a/lronomica, the eclipse of the sun, and the pas
sage of Mercury.
     Besides these works, the public were indebted to him for
various short essays, published sometimes in his own journals
and printed sometimes separately : such as a fliort treatise on
chronology ; an essay on the extraordinary winter, together
with a chronological view of the weather in general ; several
researches respecting the continued drought of the winter of
the year 1779 ; on fogs, and the influence of fiery meteors ;
a prognostication of the weather from the flight of birds;
considerations on a new cycle, and the state orthe planets ;
general rules for foretelling the periods of rain and wind in
the Adriatic gulph, from an observation of the heavens.
Other papers by him are to be found in many of the public
Journals, and in the Transactions of learned societies.                The
Journal of Modena contains his defence of Leibnitz against
Dc Luc, and observations on the falling of the mercury in
the barometer during rainy weather; that of Pisa, a treatise
on the influence of the moon, in answer to the objections of
Frisi. Various meteorological and philosophical papers writ
ten by him may be found likewise in the Venetian, Vicentinr*,
and Milanese journals, in some of the French journals, and
 in the Transactions of the Society of Manheini. The Phi
 losophical Transactions, those of the Institute of Bologna,
 and of the Academy 0/ Berlin, contain three of his papers,
 viz. De ÆJlu reciproco Marts Adriatic's, De Calore Lwiart;
 and De Vi Luna in Atmospharam, ex Observa!i(jvibiis baro-
 metricis.       Some of his astronomical observations were pub
 lished in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris.
 The Transactions of the Academy of Padua, however, con
 tain the greatest number of papers written by this diligent
 philosopher : such as, a description of an aurora borealis,
 with a chronological account of the appearance of this phæ-

           Discovery of Coal at the Cape   of Good Hope.         261
 nomcnon since the time of the Romans; a determination of
 the longitude and latitude of the observatory of Padua ; a
 treatise on the physical properties of the atmosphere in dif
 ferent places, from thermometrical and barometrical observa
 tions, and from the phænomena of vegetables ; observations
 on thunder; researches respecting the heat in several parts of
 Italy, from the latitude of 41 to 470; description of a beautiful
 fire-ball seen on the nth of September 1784 at Padua; and
 a great many astronomical "observations made in conjunction
 with Chiminello.      He left behind him several works in ma
 nuscript, among which were, observations on the travels of
 Marco Polo, and on the real epoch of the celebrated Chinese
 wall.
     Amidst such occupations Toaldo spent his days in tran
 quillity, notwithstanding the unhappy ferment which prevailed
 in his native country ; and might perhaps have been still
 alive had not his end been hastened by chagrin.         A fruitless
 attempt made in favour of a young man who had been de
 prived of his office, gave him so much uneasiness, that he first
 lost his natural vivacity, and soon after felt himself indisposed ;
 on the 7th of November 1797 he was attacked by a nervous
 affection, and died on the nth, in the 79th year of his age.
     Toaldo was of small stature, had a friendly aspect, and in
 general an appearance that inspired confidence. His conduct
 was amiable, his deportment easy, and his conversation,
 which was animated, displayed great knowledge and an ex..
Jtensive acquaintance with various branches of science : simple
 in his manners, open and sincere, he abandoned himself only
 to the softer paflions, and seemed to have no other ambition
 than that of being useful.    He was steady in his friendstiip,
 always ready to do good offices in the most disinterested man
 ner, and indulgent towards every one.          To the talents of a
 literary man he added the virtues of the citizen, and there
 fore was universally respected, especially by those who en
joyed his intimate acquaintance.

faggots (the produce of fix or eight hours hard labour) swing
ing at the two ends of a bamboo carried across the shoulder.
    Some families have two and even three (laves, whose sole
employment consists in climbing the mountains in search of
fuel. The expense of a few faggots, whether thus collected
or purchased by the load, for. preparing victuals onlv, as the
kitchen alone has any fire-place, amounts, in a moderate fa
mily, to forty or fifty pounds a year.
     The addition to the inhabitants of five thousand troops,
 and a large fleet stationed at the Cape, increased the demand
for fuel to such a degree, that lerious apprehensions were en
tertained of some deficiency shortly happening in the supply
of this necessary article. Under this idea, the attention of
the English was directed towards finding out a substitute for
wood. The appearance of all the mountains in southern
Africa being particularly favourable to the supposition that
 fossil coal might be tound in the bowels of molt of those in
 ferior hills connected with and interposed between them and
 the sea, his excellency the earl of Macartney, well knowing
 how valuable an acquisition such a discovery would prove to
 the colony, directed a search to be made.
     Boring-rods were prepared, and men from the regiments
 who had laboured in the collieries of England were selected
 to make the experiment.      Wynberg, a tongue of land pro
jecting from the Table Mountain, was the spot fixed on, and
 the rods were put down there through hard clay, pipe clay,
 iron-ilor.e, and land- stone, in successive strata, to the depth
 of twenty-three feet. The operation of boring was then dis
 continued, by a discovery Then made of actual coal coming
 out, as miners express it, along the banks of a deep rivulet
 stowing out of the Tygerberg, a hill that terminates the isth
 mus to the eastward.      The stratum of coaly matter appeared
 to lie nearly horizontal.   Immediately above it was pipe clav
 and white land-stone, and it rested on a bed of indurated
 clay.    It ran from ten inches to two feet in thickness; dif
  ferent in its nature in different parts; in some places were
 dug out large ligneous blocks, in which the traces of the
  bark, knots, and grain, were distinctly visible; and in the
 very middle of these were imbedded        pieces of iron pyrites,
 running through them in crooked veins or lying in irregular
  lumps.     Other parts of the stratum consisted of laminated
  coal of the nature of turf, such as bv naturalists would be
  called lithanlbrax, and pieces occurred that seemed to differ
  in nothing from that species known in England bv the name
  of Bovey coal.    The ligneous part burned with a clear flame
  without much smell, and left a residuum of litrht white anV>

face a deep brown ochraceous crust.        The borer being put
down in several places in hopes of meeting with the main

                BABYLONIAN INSCRIPTIONS.
  JL  HOUGH        a great many travellers speak of the ruins of
the antient Babylon, and describe the bricks of which these
ruins are composed, verv few of them have noticed the sin
gular inscriptions or characters impressed on them.        Pietro
della Valle,' a. most circumstantial and accurate traveller,
even carried some Babylonian bricks to Italy, one of which
he presented to Kireher, then residing at Rome, to be pre
served  in his musæuin, still extant in that city; but neither he
himself, nor that learned Jesuit, who was so much encaged in
researches respecting Egyptian, Chinese, and other Kinds of
oriental literature, ever made mention of Babylonian inscrip
tions.
   The first by whom they were noticed seems to have been
father Emanuel, a Carmelite friar, who, having resided some
time at Bagdad, in his manuscript account, ipeaks of cha
racters imprefled on the antient bricks still remaining among
the ruins of Babvlon, which, d'Anville fays, would supply
the literati, who are desirous of penetrating into the remotest
antiquity, with entirely new matter for meditation and study.
    After him Niebuhr, in his Travels to Arabia, mentions
inscriptions on the Babylonian bricks still extant, but with
out telling whether they contained characters unknown, or
similar to anv already discovered; only, when speaking of
                                R 4                           the

the bricks on which they are inscribed, he says, that he saw
 inscriptions of the fame kind on other bricks at Bagdad and
 in  Persia.
    But the most circumstantial, and the most recent notice re
 specting them, is that of M. Beauchamp, correspondent of
 the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, who, by residing
 several years at Bagdad, had more leisure to examine and
 describe the ruins of Babylon ; which he did in his account
 inserted in the Journal des Savans for 1790.
    In this account, the author, speaking of the remains of
                   "
 Babylon, fays, — On the side of the river are those immense
 ruins which have served, and still serve, for the building of
 Helle, an Arabian city containing ten or twelve thousand
 inhabitants.    Here are found thole large and thick bricks,
 imprinted with unknown characters, specimens of which         I
 have presented to the abbe Barthelemy."         What kind of
 characters, however, these were, neither Beauchamp nor that
 celebrated antiquary, who wrote with so much ability on the
 Phœnician, Palmyrenian,        and other inscriptions, thought
proper to determine; and it is only by his successor,
M. Millin, that we have lately been made acquainted with
 the existence of some Babylonian bricks at Paris, containing
inscriptions, which were sent by Beaucharn-p from Babylon,
 and of which drawings or copies were transmitted to M. Her
 der, at Weimar, and. to protestor Munter, at Copenhagen.
    In the mean time, the Honourable East India Company,
 being always desirous to lend their assistance to those who
 may be employed in the elucidation of oriental antiquities,
 and being informed that, near the town of Hillah, on the
 river Euphrates, there exist the remains of a very large and
 magnificent city, supposed to be Babylon ; and that the Dricks
 of which those ruins are composed, are remarkable for con
 taining, on an indented scroll or label, apparently a distich,
 in characters totally different from any now made use of in
 the East, directed the governor of Bombay to give orders to
 their resident at Bafl'orah, to procure from thence ten or a
 dozen of the bricks, and to transmit them, carefully packed
up, as early as possible to Bombay, that they might be thence
forwarded to them in one of their ships sailing for England.
    In consequence we. were gratified, at the commencement
of the present year and century, at London, with the first
view of inscriptions, which, on comparing them with the
 Persepolitan characters as given by Le Bruyn, Chardin,
Niebuhr, and other travellers, appeared to be of the fame
origin, being only more complex, and connected by long
lines, forming whole and half squares, stars, triangles, &c;
          6                                                  so

                   Notices respecting     New Bools.                 265
so  that they prove to be a different combination, though formed
of nearly the same elements and nail-headed strokes.
    It is well known that, for more than a century past, about
which time the Persepolitan inscriptions were first discovered
by European travellers, opinions have been much divided
respecting these characters.          Some have believed them to be
talismans, and others       the  characters    of the Guebres, or an-
tient inhabitants    of  Persia  ;  others held  them for mere hiero
glyphics,     and  others    for   alphabetic   characters,   like ours.
 Kæmpfer supposed         them     to  express  whole  ideas,    like the
 Chinese characters, but that they had been appropriated
 solely for ihe palace of Istakhar.
     After that period, however, some of a similar kind were
 found also in Egypt; but as neither the Egyptian hierogly
 phics, nor the characters observed on the mummies, had the
 least resemblance to them, they served only to prove the con
 nexion, which we know from history that Persepolis once
 had with Egypt.        Raspe, on finding some others on a cy
 linder of loadstone, persuaded himself that they were the
 same with the Chinese characters ; and, consequently, that
 the Chinese writing had been formerly known and cultivated
 on this fide of the Ganges.
     The above account ot the discovery of these inscriptions is
 taken from Dr. Hager's preface to his late work entitled Dis
sertation on the newly discovered Babylonian Inscriptions* , in
 which the learned author endeavours to prove that the Perse
 politan characters were derived from the Babylonian.
     " By the Babylonian bricks here exhibited," fays the
 learned author, " the whole difficulty in regard to their
 origin is removed; as it is evident that Babylon, in point of
 cultivation, was much earlier than Persepolis, and that the
 Chaldeans were a celebrated people when the name of the
  Persians was scarcely known.
     " To confirm this opinion, and bv it to prove that the
  Persepolitan   characters were derived from the Babylonian,
  I have thought it necessary to begin this work by a brief
  examination of the antiquity, extent, and sciences of the
 Babylonians ; and through scantiness of original monuments,
  to prove, by astronomy, architecture, and languages, their
  well-founded claim to antiquity.            At the fame time I have
  endeavoured to show that not only the Persians, but also the
  Indians, were disciples of the Chaldeans; and that the Egyp
  tians themselves, who pretend to be the instructors of all na
  tions, probably derived their pyramids and obelisks from Ba
 bylon.      Proceeding then to the Babylonian inscriptions, I

 have shown their similarity to that celebrated alphabet which
 the Indians call divine or celestial (deva-nagari),              because
 they    believe that   it  was   communicated     by  the Deity himself
 in a voice from heaven ; and I have tried to prove that they
 were not derived from heaven, but from our earth, and from
 the borders of the Euphrates. I have confirmed my assertion
 by means of the Tibetan characters, those acknowledged de
 scendants of the Indian ones, and thus endeavoured to in
 validate the opinion of that great antiquity and boalled ori
 ginality of the Bramins."
     In a future Number we shall give a further extract from
 this curious work : in the mean time we present our readers
 with a specimen of the inscriptions. (Sec Plate           VIII.)
                                 MEDICINE.
     Professor Schumacher, of Copenhagen, has published the
 first volume of his Medico-chirurgical             Observations.     As
the author attends an hospital, he had occasion to make
curious remarks worthy of confidence. His zeal induced him
to substitute in his practice the use of indigenous for that of
foreign plants, lie has employed the gratiola instead of ipe
cacuanha. In such cases when this plant does not produce its
essect, he recommends assisting it with the addition of a little
rhubarb.        He has discovered that, in wounds and ulcers at
tended with inflammation, the cortex hippocajlani               or cortex
                    the   s.inie essect as cortex peruvianus, which is
falicli   produces
far dearer.      The carex arenaria, also, mav be substituted for
sarsaparilla.     It results from the author's experiments, that
the j'abœ pichurim are an efficacious remedy for the whites ;
especially when the disease is inveterate, and arises from
weakness.
    Dr. Tode, of Copenhagen, continues also, with success, his
Medico-chirurgical Dictionary.             In the first number ot the
fifth volume the author informs the faculty that a foetus of
199 days is susceptible of being brought into the world alive,
but without all the symptoms of perfect conformation, and
without being in      a state to    prolong its existence.
                    MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE.
    Citizen Bellock, a French physician, has lately published
a work entitled Legal and Judicial Medicine.                 The object
of this work is to inquire how far medical knowledge may
be usefully employed in legal investigations.               The author
has treated the subject with much ability, and with all that
cautious pyrrhonifm so necessary in an inquiry of such im
portance.       Among the points he discusses we shall notice the
                                                             following :

                            BOTANY.
    Dr. Schrader,   one of the most celebrated German bota
nists, publishes at Grittincjen a botanical journal containing
an account of the most important discoveries in regard to the
science of vegetables.    This journal, written in Latin and in
German, appears every three months. Each number or vo
lume consists of about 450 pages duodecimo, illustrated with
three plates, each of which exhibits several figures.         The
author divides each number into four parts. The first is
destined for the papers and memoirs addressed to him ; in
the second he gives an extract from new works ; the third
contains the most important discoveries and observations
made in the science of botany ; and the fourth, every thing
most interesting in the correspondence which the author
maintains with the literati in Europe.
     Though every part of botany is cultivated with the most bril
liant success in the north of Europe, the study of the crypto-
 gamia class of plants, that is to fay, t'hose the sexual organs
 of which are difficult to be discovered, seems to engage, in
 a particular manner, the botanists of those countries.        To
 them we are much indebted for the light which has been
 thrown on this department of botany.           The labours of
 Hedwig, Hoffman, Schrader, Humboldt, Persoon, Flugge,
 Stromeyer, &c. have dissipated the obscurity with which the
 nature and origin of mushrooms were surrounded.              This
 journal, therefore, of which six numbers have already ap
  peared, as it contains all the new discoveries and observa
  tions in regard to botany, cannot fail to be of utility to those
  who are fond of this science.
      A very valuable work on this subject is now publishing in
  Paris.   It is an account of new and rare plants collected by-
  C. Cells, with fine plates. The history of these plants is
  drawn up with great ability by the celebrated botanist Ven-

                   ROVAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.
 A-kT     the    anniversary   meeting on the 30th of November
 the amount of receipts and expenditures was declared, and
 the names of the new and the deceased members were read
 over by the secretary.
    The president, the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, K. B.
 in the name of the Society, presented Sir Godfrey Copley's
 gold medal to Mr. Astley Cooper for his paper on the effects
 which take place from the destruction of the membrana tym-
 pani, and on an operation for the removal of a particular spe
 cies of deafness.
    Afterwards the Society         proceeded to the choice of the
 council and officers for the      ensuing year.
    The members, as usual,         on that day dined together at the
Crown and Anchor tavern,            in the Strand.
    Dec.    10. was read a paper by Dr. Maskelyne, astronomer
 royal,  drawn     up from the notices published by Piazzi, of his
discovery    of a  new planet rather larger than our earth, and re
volving    in  an   orbit between Jupiter and Mars; to which he
propoles giving the name Ceres Fcrdinandia.             All doubts re
specting    this  discovery  will  be  resolved at its next appearance
in March      1802.
    On the      17th was read a paper, by Everard Ilome, Esq.
giving an account of one of the most extraordinary subjects
of comparative anatomy that has ever appeared — a descrip
tion of the Platypus atiatinus, an amphibious animal, of
which a male and a female were brought from New South

Observations    made during three Years on the metallic Chains
 suspended     from the Dome of the Pantheon to ascertain any
     horizontal or vertical Change that might take place in the
  Building.  By C. Prony.
  The late minister of the interior, Benezech, having ap
pointed a commifiien to resume the labours of those before
established for examining the Pantheon, and pointing out
the means that might be necessary for its preservation,
C. Prony, member of this commission, read an interesting
memoir on this subject, which was heard with great atten
tion.    Five metallic chains, composed of links each 3*937
inches in length, are suspended below the cupola of the Pan
theon.     Four of these chains are parallel to the vertical sur
faces of the planes of the pillars ; the fifth is attached to
the centre of the exterior dome, and hangs down near to
the ground.      The centres of five horizontal circular plates
are made to correspond very exactly to the points where the
weights with which each chain is loaded terminate. These
plates are raised on vertical gradua'ed stalks, which rife and
fall freely in sockets, and which can be fixed to any height
by means of screws.       Concentric circles are traced out on
each plate, and meteorological instruments placed in different
parts of the edifice indicate the differences of temperature.
   Chains suspended in this manner can fink down only in
consequence of three causes. 1       The dilatation of the metal,

on   ametallic system, interrupted by links, were examined
with as much accuracy as       is possible to attain to in re

    plates ot different metals arc lengthened by a given and con
    stant quantity, from the temperature of ice to that of boiling
    water *.
         The      second cause of elonention is estimated by a method
    described  with great accuracy in Prony's memoir.
       The third  was that of the greatest importance to be known
    to the commission ; for some architects entertained fears that
    the edifice was sinking.    This movement, according to the
    hypotheses of some, by causing the pillars, which are said lo
    he too weak to sustain the mass, to give way, would have
    crushed them, and the dome would have funk vertically on
    itself.
       The   possibility of such a disastrous effect: suggested to the
    commission a desire to ascertain how far this was probable.
    Prony has detailed, in his memoir, a great number of pre
    cautions which he took to estimate this danger. After a
    long and accurate investigation, he was convinced that no
    alteraiion has taken place in the surfaces of the walls of the
    foundation,         and particularly in the vertical direction of the
    ]>illars ;   that    the parallelism os the circular cornices of the
    cupola    is  still  preserved ; that the three domes arc in uo man
    ner affected; and that an examination of the pillar which
    has funk most, proves it to be found.    The blistering or scal
    ing off  of the composition which   surrounds  the pillars was
    occasioned therefore onlv by the sinking of the latter, and
    the sinking arose from an error in the construction.   But can
,   this sinking make any progress?    The attention of the com
    mission wisl no doubt be directed to this object; and the in
    strument invented by C. Prony is calculated to ascertain it.
                         New Uuiviinic         Vj.xpcr'iments.
       It appears that the identity of galvanism and electricity is
    perfect U established by recent facts.  C. Biot has found that
    the galvanic fluid in the different kinds of apparatus which
 produce          it,
              follows exactly the fame progress as electricity
 wouM under the like circumstances.

   great velocity, while the large platel will give a greater mass
   with a less velocity. Shocks which depend on the velocity of
   the fluid will not be increased with the size of the plates; while
   metallic combustions which depend on its mass and its con
   tinued presence, ought with this size to be doubly augmented.
   This is a simple explanation of the experiments of C. Hachette,
   Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Thenard.
        C. Biot has considered galvanism also in regard to its che
   mical nature ; and finding that what takes place in water
   brought into communication with the pile has been suffi
   ciently examined, he was desirous of seeing what takes place in
   the pile itself, and what its action is on the surrounding bodies.
        As it is well known that the zinc of the pile soon becomes
   oxidated when it acts, it was necessary to discover whence
   the oxygen arose.       For this purpose C. Biot, in company
   with C.F. Cuvier, made experiments, which proved that the
   atmospheric air is decomposed, and gives up its oxygen to the
   pile ; that this oxygen increases the galvanic effects, but that
   it is not absolutely necessary to them; that these effects take
   place even in vacua, provided the pile is well moistened with
   water; which proves that the water is decomposed.
        Guyton found that the absorption of the oxygen of the air
,\by the pile is so complete, that it may be employed as an
  !,eudiometric    mean to measure the quantity of oxygen con
   tained in any given kind of air.
        Biot next employed this oxidation of the pile as a means
    of confirming his theory respecting the progress of the fluid.
    In the cafe when the fluid possesses a greater velocity the
    oxidation ought to be accelerated ; small plates therefore be
    come sooner oxidated      than large ones ; a pile the two ends
    of which communicate by wires is also oxidated much
    sooner, as might be expected, than that where there is no
    such communication.
        The same author has discovered that the galvanic fluid is
    transmitted with difficulty through water, but that it easily
    i lides over its surface ; an effect produced also, according to
      Viestley's experiments, by weak electricity possefling great
    velocity.
        C. Ganthenet, who is not a member of the Institute, has
    communicated some interesting experiments on the fame
    subject, in which he shows, in particular, that it is possible
    to make effective galvanic piles without any metallic sub
    stance whatever.      These experiments serve to confirm those
    before made by Pfaffand Humboldt when they tried galvanism
     only on animals.

  While   these researches were making in France, the English
tnade some  of a peculiar and decisive kind. They have been
able to imitate the most singular effects of galvanism by com
mon electricity, by making the conductors much thinner and
longer.
                         CHEMICAL ARTS.

  This method, invented by Seguin, consists in employing
       of sulphuric acid in five hundred parts of water.

New Method of i leaching the Pulp of which Paper is made.
   The art of bleaching raw cloth almost immediately, by
means of the oxygenated muriatic acid, is the invention of
Berthollct.    Chaptal made a happy application of it to re
store the whiteness of books and prints that have been stained;
but it remained to employ it for previously bleaching the
pulp of which paper is made.          This was attempted by
Loysel   some  years ago, in order to  render it difficult to imi
tate aflignats, on account of the perfection of their manu
facture.    This paper money, in a political view, may be
considered several ways; but as an object of art, it is certain
that it has occasioned a multitude or ingenious inventions,
which will long remain useful after aflignats stiall have been
forgotten.      The different processes are now gradually made
public, since they are no longer secrets of state.    The public
are already in full possession of the stereotype art; and that of
the fabrication of paper, no less interesting, is now laid open,
also.    It is attended with the double advantage of beauty and
ceconomv.
   By means of this method, all rags may produce a pulp
exceedingly white; but they are not all proper for making
        strong, and difficult to be broken, though thin, — aqua-
fiaperessential to bank paper, and others of the fame kind.
  ity
New white or raw rags, cordage, and other articles, the
hemp and flax of which have not been much worn, ought to
be chosen for this purpose.        Old rags do well enough, for
thick paper, or that which does not require much tenacity.
    When the rags have been picked and cut into small mor
sels, they are put into vats, where they undergo     a   fermen
tation, which changes the nature of their colouring matter,
 by  rendering it,   as    were, saponaceous, and susceptible of
being carried off      by it
                           water when washed, and afterwards
beat.     The heat, during the fermentation, must not be suf
fered to exceed 100' or        12° of Fahrenheit's thermometer,
 which generally takes place in fifteen days.

    The moment of          subjecting; the rags to the action of the
 acid    is   not  a matter   of indifference.     If   thev are bleached
 entire, as the interior of each thread does not experience any
 action, this would afterwards alter the whiteness of the
         ; and if the workman         mould wait till they were abso-
fiaste
  utely     reduced   to  pulp,   the  pulp would form a body with
 which it would be difficult to mix the acid intimately.              The
 matter then must be taken at a mean state between that of
 rags and that of pulp completely triturated.               For this pur-
 pole the rags are made to pass under a first cylinder to sepa
 rate the fibres; they are then subjected to bleaching, and
then converted into pulp by means of another cylinder.
    If  the rags are raw, two baths of oxygenated muriatic acid
or bleaching liquor, aud one of sulphuric acid, are employed.
 If they are white, one bath of the liquor and one of sulphu
 ric acid will be sufficient.
    The muriatic acid is prepared either with common muriatic
 acid and oxide of manganese, or by means of sulphuric acid
 with oxide of manganese and muriate of soda (common salt).
The last method is the most economical ; 25 parts of oxide
of  manganese, 70 of common salt, and 120 of' sulphuric acid,
of 31     degrees of density (by the areometer), will be sufficient
to charge a receiver of 270«gaIlons.               The strength of this
liquor is appreciated by means of a solution of indigo, which
is prepared by dissolving one part in weight of indigo in seven
parts of sulphuric acid concentrated to 66 degrees, and which
is then diluted in 992 parts of water, according to the me
thod of Descrozilles.          When one measure (in volume) of
the bleaching liquor annihilates the colour of nine of this
solution of indigo, the bath proper for bleaching 110 pounds
avoirdupoise       of rags, after being subjected to the first cylin
der, is composed of 24 gallons of such bleaching liquor di
luted in 120 gallons of pure water.
    The expense of these different operations will be moderate,
 when one bath of bleaching liquor and one of sulphuric acid
are employed, which is generally tha cafe, and the paper is
exceedingly beautiful.          There is no doubt therefore that the
price     of   paper  will  be  much   diminished, when the method
 here explained is employed and brought into general prac
tice.
 On   the    Fixity which Antimony acquires by its Alloy with Tin.
    When attempts were made to restore to commerce that
 prodigious quantity of metallic matters which had been em
 ployed in making bells, it was found that the first operation
 necessary      was to separate the copper and        tin, which formed
                                                                     their

  their principal constituent prtrts.   The copper was easily ob
  tained by calcining a part of the bell metal, and then throw
  ing it upon another part of the same metal in a state of
  fusion ; but the scoriæ produced, during this reduction, were
  lost.
     More intelligent chemists, and particularly Anfry, found
  means to reduce the scoriæ, ;uul to restore to commerce a
  large quantity of tin, and a still larger of copper.      The tin,
 however, obtained in the last result has peculiar qualities ;
 its fracture is different from that of common tin, it is harder,
  and more easily broken.
  .  C. Sage has found means to imitate this tin, extracted
 from bell-metal, by mixing with tin a little antimony; and it
 results from his experiments, that the latter metal alloyed
 with tin, in the proportion of a sixth part, unites with it in
 so intimate a manner that it is almost impossible to separate
 it.    C. Sage has no doubt then that the tin of bell-metal
 contains a certain quantity of it ; but C. Sage has ascer
 tained, by several experiments, that it does not prevent it
 from being employed in making tin plate, and even for tin
 ning    vessels.

                               Kingdom.
     C. Guvton has given a description of a kind of ore of an
 timony lately discovered in the province of Gallicia, speci
 mens of which had been transmitted to him by Don Anto
 nio Angulo, inspector general of the mines of Andalusia.
 He soon found, by analvsis, that the metal in this ore is in
 the state of oxide; but the structure of the mineral, its in
 terior texture, its well characterized striae, plainly announced
 that it was the passage from fulphuret to oxide, without an
 alteration of form.     It was therefore of importance to disco
 ver how this change could have been effected.
     C. Guvton tried all the simple or compound substances
 which might be presumed to exist in the bowels of the earth,
in order to imitate, in the laboratory, this labour of nature.
The fulphuret of antimony, both natural and artificial, re-
fisted all his numerous attempts.        He supposed, very justly,
 that the decomposition of water ought to act a principal-part
 in this operation, and even that it presented the only means
 of accounting for this alteration, since it ought at the fame
time to furnish oxygen, and to take away the sulphur by
 means of the hydrogen ; but it was necessary to discover
 what could have determined this decomposition.          C. Guyton
 considers it as the flow and progressive result of affinities put

                     Emeralds foetid in France.
    This  discovery    was made by Lelicvrc.          Travelling near
 Limoges,    he  observed,   in  the  stones employed    for repairing
 the roads, a hard greenish substance, which he judged to be
 a beryl or an emerald.        His conjecture was confirmed by
 the chemical analysis which Vauquelin made of specimens
 sent by him to that chemist, and by Uaiiv's examination of
 their mechanical structure.         These emeralds will not be of
 much use as ornaments ; but they may be employed by che
 mists to extract from them that kind of earth called gluchie,
 which Vauquelin discovered in the emerald and the beryl, and
 which these emeralds of Limoges readily furnish, as C. Le-
 lievre found several pounds of them, and was even able, by
 combining the fragments, to recompute aprilm ot more than
 four inches in diameter, and nearly the fame in height.

been tried to determine the nature of this influence.     Some
have thought that it was exercised by means of the phases;
others have supposed that it depeuded on the respective po
sition of the moon and the sun ; and as this position recurs
nearly the fame at the end of nineteen years, the latter have
concluded that meteors must also return almost the same in
the course of that time.      C. Lamarck, who has supposed
another influence of the moon in regard to its declination,
and who has endeavoured to establish his discovery by several
memoirs, has also endeavoured to ascertain what truth there
may be in this periodical return of the variations of the at
mosphere at the end of nineteen years; and he has found, by
comparing meteorological observations, that this return is far
from being so correct as is generally believed.    Astronomers
also know well, that the cycle of nineteen years is not exact
within an hour and a half; an error which amounts to a
whole day in the course of 308 years.
                           ZOOLOGY.
 On the Difference which exists between the Crocodiles    of the
                   old and the new Continent.
    A precise determination of the large species of animals is
more important than might be imagined, as we have in
stances that, for want of such determinations, travellers have
placed in America several animals of the old continent which
never existed there, such as the lion, tiger, panther, and
some others.     These they confounded with other animals of
a different kind, though nearlv related to them.      The fame
error has occurred in regard to crocodiles, even on the part
of naturalists. In order to rectify such mistakes, C. Cuvier
has fliown, that most authors have been entirely unac
quainted with the difference which exists between the croco
diles of the old and the new world, or have badly under
stood them, and explained them still worse.
    IJc has proved, by an accurate description, that these ani-
mals form two species, the distinguishing characters of which
are as follow :
    ]st. The crocodile has an oblong muzzle, the upper jaw of
which has indentations on each side to afford a passage to the
fourth tooth in the lower; its hind feet are entirely webbed.
    2<\. The caiman    has an obtuse muzzle ; its upper jaw
receives the fourth tooth of the lower in a particular cavity
which conceals it; the hind feet are only half webbed.
   The first of these species belongs to the old world, the
second to the new.      The name of the latter originates from
                               S 3                       India,

which it must have been introduced into America by the
Spaniards or the Dutch.

long beaked crocodile, or the gavial, which forms, by gene
ral acknowledgment,       a peculiar species.
          Oil two new Kinds of oviparous Quadrupeds.
    These two species, described by Lacepede, are interesting
not only on account of their novelty; they are interesting also
as they exhibit a number of toes not before observed but in
 the class of reptiles.
    The first, which Lacepede calls monodaftylas, has indeed
 only one toe on each foot. These feet are so short, and the
 body and tail so long, that the animal has a great resem
 blance to a snake ; it is covered with scales disposed in
 transversal bands.
     The other species, called tetradatlylos, has feet as sttort,
 and a body as long, as the preceding; but each foot is fur
 nished with four toes, and the body is marked on each side
 with a longitudinal furrow.
     These two specks will form hereafter two new genera in
 Lacepede's genera of lizards.
           On a new Kind of Infests called Atratloceros .
     This insect was brought from the kingdom Owara, in
 Africa, by Palisot-Bcauvois.         The name given to it bv that
  traveller signifies the spindle bom, and indeed such is the
  form of its antenna?.      It is distinguished from other coleop-
  tera bv its wings being much longer than the cover, and not
  folding under them, and by having five articulations in all
  the tarsi.   This last character brings it near to the Jlaphilini,
  while the preceding gives it an analogy to the mxydales.
  The form of its antennulap is very singular. C. Beauvojs
  thinks that this infect lives in the woods.

On the Influence             which the Air and other dirisorm Fluids
                              have on Germination.
  This new labour of Sennebier is a                    supplement      to his large
•workon 'the physiology of vegetables.                  The experiments        were
made by placing the feeds on moist flannel, under bells filled
with different kinds of gas, the influence of which it was in
tended to try.   All these seeds refused to germinate in azote,
in carbonic acid, and in pure hydrogen gas. The presence
of oxygen was in general necessary, and its employment is
in part to absorb the carbon of the seeds, to form of it car
bonic acid.   What is singular                   is,
                                  that pure oxygen    not the               is

we here find that wonderful fact presented to us               many        by   so
other circumstances of the organic economy, viz. that the
mixture most favourable to germination          that of which the

the first portions would scarcely be sufficient to absorb the
carbon of the seeds, and no more would remain to vivify
them.
   Seeds may be made to germinate also,       mixing oxygen      by
with carbonic acid, or with hydrogen.     In the latter cafe,
the carbon which issues from the seeds unites itself inti
mately with the hydrogen. Too much carbonic acid in air
does more hurt 10 seeds than too much azote, and too much
azote more than too much hydrogen.      Various vapours may
also alter the air,   as to annihilate germination

    This   necessity of oxygen in nature is liable, however, to
some    exceptions. Some feeds have such force, that they
decompose the water to separate from it oxygen, if they can
not dispense with it entirely : of this kind are peas, which
germinate in water deprived of air, in every sort of gas, and
even in oil, provided they have been before steeped in water.

               Progress of the Amelioration of Wool.
   Tefliw and Huzard gave an account to the class of the
sale of the wool and sheep of the flock of Rambouillet in the
vear 9, as well as of the progress of the amelioration of wool
in France during that period. The most interesting experi
ment mentioned by them was, that of leaving the wool on
some soeep for two years : by these means it acquired double
length, gave a double weight, without any inconvenience to
the animals, and was rendered exceedingly proper for the
manufacture of woollen stuffs, so that it was employed in
making kersevmeers, which were presented to the class, and
which are equal lo the best English stuffs of that kind.
               PHILOMATIC SOCIETY OF PARIS.
   C. Sylvestre read a note on the long wool of the sheep of
Rambouillet.         It was long believed that sheep lose their wool
every year; and this assertion, void of foundation, has been
advanced in works of great respectability.               The members of
the Council of Agriculture,            charged with the inspection of
the national sheep establishment               at Rambouillet, were de
sirous of verifying this fact ; and for that purpose suffered the
sheep to remain two or three years without being shorn. By
these means they obtained very long wool of uniform fine
ness, and which was equal in weight to what would have
been produced by two or three shearings.
    C. Vauquelin communicated a note on the nature of the
earth eaten by the inhabitants of New Caledonia. Humboldt,
in one of his letters to C. Fourcroy, speaks of an earth eaten
by the Otomaquas when they experience a scarcity of pro
visions*.     C. Labillardiere has confirmed, by an observation
made in a part of the world very distant from that inhabited
by the Otomaquas, a fact equally singular — where the inha
bitants of New Caledonia, when urged by hunger, ate large
quantities of a greenish steatites, tender and friable.             It may
now be readily conceived how the horrid custom of eating

$6 of silex, 17 of oxide, 3 or 40s water, and a or 3 of lime
and copper.
   It contains   therefore no nutritive part, and can be consi
dered only as a burthen — as a mechanical mean for sus
pending the pain occasioned by hunger.
   The fame chemist read a notice on blue oxide of iron.
This substance, sent to the Council of Mines by baron De
Molt, is of a bright blue colour: it presents itself under the
form of small iniulated masses in the cavities or fissures of
quartz and hard greenish steatites.        It is friable, but a little
unctuous to the touch.       It loses its colour by the flame of
the blow-pipe, and then fuses into a greenish white glass.
   It loses its colour neither by acids nor by weak alkalies;
a circumstance which distinguishes it from lapis lazuli and
prusfiate of iron.    It communicates to the muriatic acid in
which it has been put to digest, a saffron yellow colour, and
loses a little of its own colour; but it cannot be entirely de
prived of its colour without distplving it at the fame time :
nothing then remains but the fame quantity of silex, which
seems to serve it as matrix.
   In examining the muriatic acid which served for this ope
ration, it is seen that it has dissolved alumine, lime, and oxide
of iron; but neither manrvnese,         sulphurated   hydrogen, nor
phosphoric acid, substances to which some might be inclined
to ascribe the blue colour of this oxide of iron, are to be dis
covered in it.     The cause of the very remarkable colour of
this oxide, a colour which it has hitherto been impossible to
communicate to iron by any chemical means, still remains,
therefore, to be determined.         It appears, however, that the
iron'in this oxide is carried to a degree of oxygenation near
to a maximum.
   Vauquelin read also a note on the saline substance called
muriciate of Salxhourg.        This matttr, to which Haiiy has
given the name of gypjiferous muriate of soda, was also sent
                                                                    to

    O     N this subject we have witnessed some extremely curious
   and interesting results since our last Number. Our present
                                                                 notice

    That, in concert with several gentlemen, zealous promoters
 of science, and whose names {hall be stated hereafter, a pile
 was constructed consisting of thirty-six pairs of plates of silver
 and zinc, with discs of flannel moistened with a solution of
muriate of ammonia interposed between the pairs; that each
plate was ten inches in diameter, or contained 78-54 square
inches ; and that, consequently, the whole surface of silver
in the pile, reckoning only one side of each plate, wasa8a7-44
square inches, and that of zinc the fame.
    With this pile, at a meeting of a committee on the 19th
inst. (December), gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, and zinc,
were deflagrated with astonishing facility.

a point left undetermined in one recorded in our last Number,
by which gold was deflagrated without any residuum being
perceived. On the present occasion, there was left on the
upper plate a copious oxide of a deep brown colour, inclining
a little J,o purple.    In the former experiment, the end-plate
of the trough to which the gold was applied was vertical ; the
oxide could be but little in quantity, and, being nearly of the
colour of the mahogany on which it fell, accounts sufficiently
for its not having been perceived.
    Silver gave a vivid green- coloured flame, extremely bril
liant.     The colour was somewhat like that of a pale emerald,
and the light more intense than that from the gold.          Gave
an oxide inclining to black.
    Copper presented phænomena similar to those observed in
deflagrating gold.
    Lead gave a light of a dilute blueifli purple, very vivid.
    Tin, a light similar to that of the gold ; but it burnt with
less energy,— perhaps owing to the leaves being thicker.
    Zinc gave a blueiffi white flame, fringed at the moment
of contact with red. It was more difficult to be deflagrated
than any of the former, but the plates at the fame time were
much thicker.
    The oxides of these last four metals were not examined.
    Some water having been poured upon the upper plate, so
as to form a kind of little standing pool, several of the metals
were presented to the plate through this water, and were de
flagrated, giving the fame coloured flame as when presented
to the bare plate.       A vapour was sometimes perceivable in
                                                           stantly

stantly after the deflagration, supposed to be a portion of the
water converted into steam by the intense heat.
    One circumstance is extremely worthy of remark.          The
(hocks from this pile, though in a state to produce such
powerful effects on the metals, could be taken with very
little inconvenience.
    Dr. Van Marum and professor Pfaff, of Keil, have lately
been engaged in a series of experiments with the Voltaic pile,
by means of which they are stated to have charged an elec
trical battery of 140 square feet of surface by mere contact
with the pile. The account that has reached us does not           (
state whether the battery received as full a charge as could
have been communicated by an electrical machine, or only
such a one as to become sensible to an electrometer.      If the
latter, the quantity of surface named tends to mislead, for a
single jar might have given the fame indication ; but if 140
square feet received a full charge, the experiment will prove a
most interesting one. The same account states, that, " by the
eleBricity of this apparatus, (namely, the Voltaic pile,) they
fused ia inches of iron wire : even plalina wire was fused by
it." If we understand the language here used, it means that
the wire was fused, not through the medium of an electrical
battery charged by means of the pile, though the introduction
of the word eleilriiity may seem, at first view, to convey that
idea, but by being brought directly into the Voltaic circuit.
If we are right in this opinion, it was, properly speaking, a
deflagration and not a mere fusion of the wire that took place;
i. e. the metal was wholly, or in a great measure, oxided, in
stead of being altered in form only, as is the cafe in simple,
fusion : if so, it was an experiment of thefame nature as those
related above, in which -several square inches of gold and silver
leaf,  &c.  were deflagrated.  The detail of Dr. Van Marum    and
professor PfafPs experiments, which these gentlemen have
promised to publish in a short time, will, however, soon clear
up the ambiguities of the short account that has reached us.
                   FULMINATING MERCURY.
    The  effects of an accidental explosion of a quantity of the
fulminating      mercury of Mr. Howard, which was experi
enced at Dr. Pearson's laboratory, while at lecture, a few
days ago, seem to be sufficiently remarkable to be worthy
of being recorded, and may possibly throw some light on the
 agency of this powder, and indicate some useful applications
in practice.
    The powder just collected from the filtering paper, on
which it lodged after the liquid from which it was precipi-
         4                                                  tated

  886                      Antiquity of the Eartb.
 tated    had passed through, was put on paper, and, for expe
 dition, laid in four loose parcels, (each of which, when dry,
 would have weighed about thirty grains,) on a tile one inch
 and a half thick and eight inches square, which had been
 previously heated to a degree a little above what could be
 borne by the hand. The tile was placed on a table, and left
 without further notice, to allow the powder to become dry.
     At the end of about half an hour the whole of it exploded,
 making a report equal at least to that of the discharge of a 32
 pounder, as declared by a naval surgeon then present. The tile
 was shivered into a number of pieces, and broken quite thrpugh
 the middle ; two panes of a window, at the distance of about
 eight inches from the tile, were also shivered ; one of which
 was opposite, and the other immediately above it ; but none
 of the adjoining squares of glass were broken. On another
 fide, at the distance of about two feet from the tile, stood a
 frame containing bottles of specimens of chemical prepara
 tions, not one of which was broken ; nor did any of the pupils
suffer, who were sitting on a form only three feet from the
powder which exploded. — The whole of the room was filled
wiih thick white fumes; and the windows were covered with
quicksilver, deposited from the exploded powder.
     1. The above accident shows that the mercurial prepara
tion cannot be employed for throwing projectiles like gun
powder, the mode of agency of the explosion being on quite
different principles, as is evident from what is above related ;
                 in the fracturing of the thick tile, and the very
fiarticularly
  ittle distance to which the concussion of the air was propa
gated.
     2. It appears that the fulminating mercury is calculated
for shivering rocks or large stones by its explosion.
     3. From the comparatively low temperature at which the
powder exploded, it may be employed for certain destruc
tive purposes in time of war, by being confined in vessels that
are liable to be heated.

things which cannot be effected by a train of gunpowder*.
                   ANTiaUITY        OF  THE EARTH.

found in Egypt, on some of the antient monuments, different
figures of the zodiac, which, supposing them to have been

further  account  of this powder, we beg to refer our readers to Mr. How
ard's paper, given in a preceding volume.
                                                                     tion,

tion, tended to give to our earth a much higher origin than our
received chronology attributes to it.         According to some phi
losophers,   we  must    go  back   from   the   present period 15,000
vears ; and even then we shall only arrive at the time in
which the figures of the zodiac were contrived : but the
world may have undergone many previous revolutions.
    With all the semblance of sagacity and truth which accom
panies this mode of argument, nothing can be more unphilo-
sophical than the inference.         Is it not an admitted fact, that
one of the first efforts of astronomers,        after their science had
attained a certain degree of perfection, was to draw from it
such modes of arrangement and calculation as might be useful
in adjusting the current time; and that the period from which
they supposed their account to set out was in a great measure
arbitrary, depending on the multiplication of cycles into each
other, counting backward from any position of the heavenly
bodies in the then current age, to the period in which these
bodies (according to their tables) must have stood in a posi
tion fitting the purpose they had in view?
    Does not the evidence adduced in different papers in the
Asiatic Researches amount almost to a demonstration that,
excepting a period which accords very well with the Scripture
accounts, the whole Bramin chronology of myriads of years
is merely a clumsy astronomical fiction, which at first was not
even intended to deceive ?
    We may also state here another well known fact, — that it
was long a favourite opinion with astrologers, that :ill the pla
nets must have been in conjunction* in the first scruple of
the sign Aries when the world was made ; because then,
according to them, was the proper time to begin a year !
Others might have been for a different arrangement, i. e. a
differently constructed zodiac; but whichever had the greatest
number of suffrages at any period, can never prove any thing
as to the fact in question.
    But, not to dwell on a subject so unprofitable, or on the
early propensity of different nations to forge for themselves
an high antiquity, is it not known to every one that the
Julian period had an arbitrary commencement ? If the his
tory of this fact had been lost, and corresponding zodiacs had
been found, would it have been correct to have inferred that
they were made 6500 years ago ?

XLVIII.      Remarh upon several Experiments made to prove
   the Conversion   of Iron into Sttcl by means of the Diamond.
   By David Mush et, Esq. of the Calder Iron Works*.
IN      the  Philosophical Magazine for November 1799 are
inserted several experiments performed by me to prove whe
ther the experiment of ihe French chemists at the Polytechnic
School relative to the formation of steel by means of the dia
mond was sufficiently conclusive.         Resting upon the result of
these experiments, no inference could be drawn to validate
the accuracy of the Parisian experiment, In every cafe, fused
metallic masses were obtained, when neither diamond nor car
bonaceous matter was used, which, from description, resem
bled every way the button obtained by fusion, in contact with,
the diamond. The results produced in my experiments, when
hammered, and put to the usual tests of heating, and plun
ging into water, exhibited the usual state of steel, closed par
tially in the grain like soft steel, and resisted, in a considerable
degree, the application of the file.        This was proof bevond
that afforded by the French chemists.           The unusual tests of
polisliing upon the lapidary's wheel, dropping the nitrou3
acid, and exhibiting the fracture of the metallic button, are
not satisfactory proof to the artist that steel was here pro
duced.
   Some time after the communication of the above experi
ments, my countryman Sir George M'Kenzie read a paper
betbre the Royal Society of Edinburgh ; in the former part
of which he exhibited results to prove that the experiment of
the French chemists relative to the diamond forming steel
was quite conclusive; and, in the latter part of his paper, he
detailed a variety of experiments to invalidate a conclusion
which I had drawn, of carbon dissolved in caloric penetrating
close vessels, and by its union with iron forming steel.       I (hall
in this paper take the liberty of making a few remarks upon
these different experiments, as they occur in the order of Sir
George's arrangement.
   I think it proper here to premise, that my not subscribing
implicitly to the conclusions drawn by the Parisian chemists
and Sir George M'Kenzie relative to the diamond and iron
proceeds not from fastidious scepticism as to the carbonaceous
matter of the diamond ; I only wish that the fact of its form-

290            .   On   the Conversion         of Iron   Into Steel
ing steel by its union with iron should be established by ex
periments more perfect arid more rigorous than any hitherto
performed, before a conclusion so important be drawn and
rested upon.
     The remarks made in the first paragraph of this paper
apply equally to the results of Sir George as described by
him, and that of the Polytechnic School. So far as the de
scription of parties? and the tests used by each, go, the results
 obtained in the experiments communicated bv me seem to
 prove, with equal certainly, the presence os steel ; and, as a
 further proof of this, I (hall adduce from the baronet's own
 experiments an identity of results obtained in two of his own
 operations, wherein it appears difficult to distinguisli betwixt
 the nature of the products.            I allude to that obtained when
 the diamond was inclosed in a cylinder of iron, and to an
 other experiment, wherein, following the process of Clouet,
  he fused a mixture of iron, carbonate of lime, and pounded
 crucible *.        In the treatment of these products respectively,
 no     fixed   or  determinate   feature of steel is applicable to the
  one more than the other.               If,
                                        therefore, in the course of sub
  sequent      communications,    I  prove,         by
                                                 the most unexception
  able experiments, that the decomposition of the carbonic
  acidin      lime never afforded one particle of carbon to the iron
  fused hi contact with        it,which iron possessed similar proper
  ties with that obtained along with the diamond,              far as the
                                                                       lo
  baronet's observation and tests went, will not the experiment
  of the diamond forming steel appear still more equivocal, and
  require more demonstrative          proofs of its combination with
  iron than any yet adduced          ?
       Upon the baronet's second experiment, wherein he ex
  posed   a    portion of iron under circumstances' similar to those
  of the diamond experiment, and obtained no fusion,                 (hall  I
   shortly remark   :    That the uncertain and unequal degree of
   heat obtained in      a smith's forge, particularly           if
                                                           single blasted,
   will easily account for few globules being fused in the one

                                      any comparative trials of quality
   that these blisters were essentially different, or produced by
   different causes. To prove that an irregularity of heat might
   produce the difference noticed, namely, the lusiou of               few-     a
    globules of the iron,       areference might be made to others
    of Sir George's own experiments, where in one he fused iron
    filings, but could not reduce fragments of horse-nails                  !

   C. Clouet  first announced two new processes for the fusion
of iron, and for the conversion of                it,
                                       in the one cafe into cast
steel equal    quality to the English marks of Hindfman and
                in
Marshall    ;and in the other, the conversion of       into itkind  a
ot cast iron         means of glass. The former experiment,
                     by
being deemed of national importance, was formally subjected
to the ablest chemists     Trance for satisfactory documents as
                                in
to the correctness of C. Clauet's pretensions.       This was un
dertaken and executed                by
                                citizens Guyton, d'Arcet, and
Vauquelin; who, after repeated experiments in the fabrica
tion and subsequent forging of the steel, pronounced             in   it,
conjunction with their most eminent artists, possessed of all
the ': external charadters and intrinsic qualities of the English
cast steel of the manufactories of Hurrtzman and Marschall;
that  itmay be used for the same purposes, and be introduced
in competition with            commerce, without fear of any
                                it   in
distinction being made to its prejudice."
   Shortly after these experiments were announced in this
country,    Iresolved to repeat them along with others, not
only with view to prove the facts established
                a                                            by
                                                        the French
chemists, but more particularly with          view to explain some
                                                        a
curious results in the manufacture of crude iron, the source
of which    I  had not before an opportunity to explore, and
which would not admit of            satisfactory explanation upon
                                          a
Clouet's supposition of the decomposition of the carbonic
 acid and the union of its carbon with iron.
    The progress and detail of            these experiments stiall hereafter
 be given suffice
            ;          at present to say, that, in following the
                          it
 process laid down       C. Clouet, with clay, carbonate of lime,
                           by
 and iron,    result similar to his was obtained
                a                                    but found
                                                             :    I

a$2              On    the Conversion   of Iron into Steel
was introduced as a substitute for the carbonate, the fusion
and the quality of the button produced were in every respect
the same ! The metal, subjected to a variety of tests, exhi
bited the various phænomena mentioned in a former part of
this paper.      Convinced that, from whatever cause this ap
pearance     of  steel  was derived, the carbonic acid was entirely
neutral,    I next   ventured    to subject iron to fusion per se; and
the result answered the novelty os my expectations.           Beautiful
buttons were obtained, of various magnitudes, possesled of
similar properties with those obtained with the carbonate and
clay, and with the de-acidisied lime and clay. The quality
of these unalloyed buttons varied, and exhibited, in a greater
or less degree, the properties ascribed to the others. From
frequent repetitions of the fame experiment with various sized
 crucibles, I found the iron less altered in a crucible whose
capacity' was little more than the contents introduced, than
when a larger crucible was used, to the same weight of iron.
    Thus circumstanced, and unable to account for this appa
rent formation of steel in any other way, I concluded that
such was the affinity of iron for carbon, that when protected
from common air, and exposed to a high temperature, it de
composed the ignited gas of the furnace, seized its carbon,
and constituted steel ; and that the degree of saturation de
pended upon the area presented by the interior surface of the
crucible to any given quantity of iron.
     I had advanced thus far when I communicated the general
result of these experiments in the Philosophical Magazine for
November 1799. '
    Soon after this, Sir George M'Kenzie read the paper for
merly alluded to.          In it he informs us that, when he pro
duced heat enough, malleable iron was fusible per se; but
 he alleges that in no cafe was the quality of the metal
 altered.
     In the present state of my information upon the subject at
 issue, I sliall cheerfully give up the c inclusion I had formerly
 drawn, of steel being formed by carbon dissolved in caloric.
 I  have stated the progress of my mind to far as it was biassed
 by the experiments formerly communicated •, and, far from
 wishing to confound by any arguments advanced in favour
 of the deduction I formerly made, I regret the facility with
 which the mind is naturally inclined to indulge in favour of
  received opinions.
     The long received opinion, that pure malleable iron was
  infusible, and the unqualified approbation passed upon a mo •
  dification of iron exactly similar in quality, by the ablest che
  mists in Paris, led me into a false appreciation of the quality
                                                                      of

of the products obtained in my own manipulations. A series
of experiments, which I (hall communicate through the me
dium of this publication, will, I hope, carry with them the
most evident demonstration, that in attributing to their results
the merits of cast steel, or steel of any quality, the French
chemists have deceived themselves, and led into error many
whose confidence in their labours was entire.
     I  cannot, however, subscribe with the same facility to the,
conclusion drawn by Sir George, that the fusion of malleable
Iron    does not in the least alter its quality : but I shall at pre
sent wave adducing any experiments to prove the contrary ;
they (hall, however, be given hereafter in their proper place.
The baronet's experiments              afford one instance,          however,
which he has overlooked in forming the opinions on which
 his assertions are founded.            He fuled two parcels of iron
 filings, the one alone, the other mixed with oxide. From
 these were obtained two buttons of iron exactly similar in
 quality, which quality, from the eulogium of the artist, we
 may justly infer was improved by the fusion.
     The question which most forcibly occurs here is this:
 What revived the oxide in contact with the iron ? What
 affinity, in this cafe, was exerted to disengage the oxygen
 and revive the metallic particles? The presence of carbona
 ceous matter must be inferred.             This again we must suppose
united to the iron, involving this consequence, that good
 malleable iron contains a portion of charcoal capable of re
viving at least i-ioth part of its weight of oxide of iron.                   If
 this mixture is necessary to constitute good malleable iron,
 and a substance be added, which, to a physical certainty,
 must deprive it of this necessary constituent part, will the
 fused aggregate still be of the same quality as a portion of the
 fame iron fused alone, or an original portion compared with
 it from the bar * ?
     I shall conclude this paper with the following observation,
 sounded upon dear-bought experience, and which I hope
 neither Sir George nor his artist will conceive as in the least
 degree personal.
      In submitting metallic results to undergo the necessary
 tests by a workman, the greatest possible degree of caution is
 necessary not to impress nim with the nature of the wished-
 for result.     A  single experiment often is the foundation of a
 theory ; and workmen, from the laudable motive of pleasing
     * hope hereafter to (how that all malleable iron contains a portion us
        I
 charcoal; that this is essentially necessary to its proper existence ; and that
 depriving   it of this carbonaceous mixture debases its quality by a total
 annihilation of its-properties.
                                     T3                            a superior,

294          The same Methods of Reasoning            common    to
a superior, as well as of exciting a disposition to a more va
luable remuneration in subsequent trials, soon discover the
bias of the operator's mind, and artfully strengthen that pre
disposing partiality which sets mature investigation aside.
Thus frequently may a disinterested person be the innocent
 cause of much error, and the occasion of many tiresome and
 laborious experiments.
 XLIX.      The /'.me Methods of Reasoning common to Mathe
     matics and to Natural Hijlory and other Branches of
     Physics.    By Mr.&. Heron.
        sir,                   To   Mr.  Tilloch.
    X   O U R valuable Publication supplies much agreeable
 evidence of the constant advancement of physical science in
 all its branches. Yet one cannot help observing, that there
 exist, between the votaries of the studies of pure and mixed
 mathematics, and the students of chemistry and natural his
 tory, a mutual jealousy and misunderstanding, which are, I
 (ear, sometimes not a little inauspicious to the general pro
 gress of philosophy.          You shall rarely see mathematics and
 natural history     flourish     at the same time, and in the same
 school   of science.     The    mathematician       looks with contempt
 on   the naturalist;     and   that   contempt     the  naturalist seldom
 fails  abundantly     to  repay.     There    is even   supposed to be an
 incompatibility      between      these diflerem    studies,  so great, that
 he    who   excels   in   the   one   must   not  hope   to  succeed  in the
 other.
     But these, Sir, are merely groundless prejudices. It is not
 to pro|)ose a paradox
                              — v lien I affirm, that " the truths of
 mathematics, and the reasonings by which these are disco
 vered, have the most exact analogy with those of natural his
 tory, and indeed of every other branch of science thai can be
 named."        I am induced to send you the following short ex
  planation   of  this proposition, not in the idea of supplying in
  it a new discovery for the use of the scientific and the learned,
  whole views are truly profound and enlarged ; but, as believ
  ing it of great importance, that this principle should be ren
  dered familiar to the minds of those who are now entering
  upon philosophical study ; and as hoping that some of those
  who are mere bigots of mathematics, and of those who are,
  on the other hand, mere bigots of natural history, may be
 brought mutually into good humour by it.
     I. Consider the nature of those reasonings by which ma-
                                          4                        thematical

               Mathematics and   to Natural History.          29,5
 thcmatical truths are discovered. Number and figure, points
 and lines in ail their possible combinations, magnitudes or
 quantities, are the subjects of mathematical investigation.
 Of these, we bring not into the world, by reminiscence from
 a former state, or by innate inspiration, any original know
 ledge prior to experience by the senses.    So simple, however,
 and primary are their ideas, that they may be considered as
 nearly coeval with the first opening of the mind to percep
 tion.   The line, the point indeed, which we perceive by
 fense, possess not each that perfection in its kind which ma
 thematical science ascribes to it. Yet from fense are our
 primary notions of the mathematical line and point never
 theless derived.   We obtain the notions of animal and vege
 table forms and colours more perfectly beautiful than any
 which are actually to be seen, solely by abstracting and again
 combining in idea the beauties which are in nature distri
 buted among different animals and vegetables.       We form in
 imagination   the character of  a  truly wise and good man by
a similar abstraction   and combination of qualities, which in
seal life are never to be seen together.     We exalt our minds
to conceive the existence of the all perfect Ruler of the uni
verse, also by the abstraction of the best qualities which we
discover in his creatures, and by combining them in our
thoughts in the highest perfection in which we are able to
imagine their coexistence. And it is just in the fame manner
that, by abstraction from the point and line, which can be
materially represented to our eyes, we attain to the concep*
tion of a mathematical poini without length, breadth, or
 thickness; and of a mathematical line, which of these qua*
lities has none attributed to it but length.
    Thus far, then, the fundamental notions in mathematical
science are gained precisely in the fame manner in which we
arrive at the knowledge of generic, specific, or clastific cha
racters in natural history; by observing individuals in ma
terial nature, and by abstracting those qualities which are
common to numbers ; leaving out those which serve but to
particularize individuals, and making the qualities abstracted
and combined anew, to our minds, the common representa*
lives of all.
    Numbers are generated from points; all other definite
magnitudes from lines ; and a line itself is also produced from
a point.     But we have no reason to believe, that, if material
nature did not suggest to our conception the repetitions of
unity, by presenting more individual objects than one to our
notice, we should ever have formed the idea of two. Nor is
it certain that we should have been able, in. imagination, to
                                T4                    distinguish

    296             The same Methods           of Reasoning     common    to
    distinguish lines into the species of curved and straight, unless
    we had seen imperfect examples of both in the extremities
    or outlines of material bodies.          Thus, not only our simplest
    mathematical ideas of unity and of extension are abstrac
    tions from material existence, just as exactly as are the ge
    nera, species, &c. in natural history ; but our noiions of the
    combining of unities and extensions, by multiplication and
    addition, lo as to produce new varieties of them, are certainly
    in their origin produced by a farther observation of material
    nature, ana without this, most probably, could not arise.
    The mathematician who pursues, in arithmetic, unity
    through all its combinations, or who combines, in exten
    sion, lines into all the imaginable diversities of curved and
    rectilinear figures, employs, in these acts, a mental process
    perfectly analogous to that of the poet who feigns, ad li> itum,
    characters of deities, men, and dæmons, by new combina-
,   tions of those moral, intellectual, and bodily qualities which
    he has had occasion to behold in real life.           This mathema
    tician does, in fact, a thing precisely similar to that which is
    done by the common mason or carpenter, who frames, of
    stone or wood, many new figures of building, furniture, and
    utensils, not exactly similar perhaps to any that he may have
    seen in simple unviolated 'nature.          The chemist acts in the
    fame manner, in every trial of the unknown combinations
    of any chemical substance of which he desires to investigate
    the character.       And it is exactly thus, too, that the zoolo
    gist, to elucidate the natural history of any animal, places it
    in every diversity of circumstances in which he can imagine
    that a new quality may t>e displayed by it.
       Compare the simpler operations in arithmetic with those
    of logic. Multiplication is only an abbreviation of addition:
    addition, in every act of            it,
                                        simply compares several different
    individuals, and thus ascertains that they belong to the fame
    species   :every act, whether of addition or of multiplication,
    is precisely that elliptical syllogism which         named an enthy-
                                                                is
    nieme.      In every act, whether of the one or of the other,
    there     is,   truth, an analysis of particulars, and
                    in                                              general    a
    induction     from   them.       Ifay, for instance,             in
                                                               addition,             a
    and   2 are 4.     This, as syllogism, affirms, that all numbers
                                     a
    containing equal units are equal             expresses
                                                  :    4     certain com
                                                                     a
    bination of unities      :   and
                                 2       make together exactly the fame
                                          2
    combination of unities;            and
                                         2     are therefore equal to 4.
                                                   2
    Let any one attend vigilantly to what passes in his mind in
    this act of addition     ;  and he will find     to be clearly what
                                                           it                        is
    here stated.      Again,    this act  of addition  shows, just like the
    observation of       arose-tree only in leaf, and of       rose-tree in
                                                                     a
                                                                                   full

molt obviously, a chain of abridged syllogisms ; a process of
regular analysis and induction ; an ascertaining of the proper
species, &c. to which certain individuals belong.          Pursue
the reasonings which respect numbers through every other
variety of the accustomed operations; and you (hall find, still,
nothing but the fame acts of ratiocination constantly repeated.
A syllogistic comparison of ideas ; to discover equality or dif
ference ; a process of analysis and induction ; a reference of
individuals to their respective species, of species to their ge
nera, &c. &c. ; are still the only acts of intellect which are
performed : and still the mind is conscious of no ideas but
what have their origin in the observation of material exist
ences, and in abstraction from these.
    Thus it is in that part of mathematics which abstracts
quantity from extension, and concerns itself only about the
relations and properties of number considered exclusively of
figure. — Examine, on the other hand, any of the propositions
and demonstrations of Euclid, or any othermathematician who
investigates the qualities of figures in the antient form of ma
thematical reasoning. Does he demonstrate a theorem ? This
is only to establiili, by analysis and induction, a general fact
before unknown.      Is he to solve a problem ? This is to explain
the secret causes of a general truth before known, but unac
 counted for; to invent a rule, and prove it to be founded on
a due knowledge of the relations of things ; or to adopt a
 rule from others, and to show by what means it is that com
 pliance with this rule perfectly accomplishes the end proposed.
A theorem and a problem differ from one another merely as
 two different modes for suggesting the same question or ques
 tions of the fame species.       In both, the mind analyses and
 abstracts just as in the prosecution of any discovery in natural
 history. The train of demonstration in the works of all the
 antient mathematicians who treat of figure, is a series of en-
 thymemes or abbreviated syllogisms.        When I go about to
                                                     demonstrate,

 298        The same Methods      of Reasoning common to
 demonstrate,       that the three angles of any triangle     are equal
  to two right angles ; what else is this, but to stiow that the
  three angles of a triangle are one species of the subdivisions
  into which the magnitude of two right angles may be marked
  out ? Can a single cafe of mathematical inquiry be pointed
  out, in which the reasoning (hall not appear to have the most
  perfect analogy with that which is used in every other branch
  of science, and, indeed, in the whole business of common
  life? Impossible.
      But the mathematician represents all magnitudes by com
 binations of lines incapable of exhibiting solid contents, or
 even, with accuracy, the diversities of surface; and in his de
 monstrations employs the letters of the alphabet to denomi
 nate those lines. He does. But the abstractions of the fancy
 of the poet are thus represented, and but in part, by the
 imagery of the sculptor and the painter. The naturalist thus
 employs delineations of those objects which he cannot keep
 constantly under his actual inspection.           The letters of the
 alphabet,   and     other signs not   in any  other   way significant,
 are employed in our reasonings in every other branch of
 knowledge, just as well as in mathematics.              Isa few tech
 nical terms be peculiar to this branch of the science of the
 magnitudes of figure ; are not certain sets of technical terms,
 in almost every other instance, much more numerous than
 those of mathematics, peculiar respedtivcly to every different
 science, and to every different branch of art ?
     It may (till, however, be alleged, that there is a peculiarity
in algebra, that branch of mathematical reasoning in which
the moderns chiefly delight. But, no : the reasoning          is, even
in algebra, still the fame. The signs only, and the abbre
viations, are somewhat different.         Algebra refines even upon
the abstractions of arithmetic, and enables the mind to pro
ceed through    a    long train of reasoning respecting numerical
quantities, magnitudes, or distinct values of any fort, without
the intervention of common language, or even of the com
mon signs of number.           But the objectis   still to arrange in
dividuals under their species, species under their genera, ge
nera under abstractions still more comprehensive, &c. The
reasoning  is  stillby   an analytical collection of particular facts,
and    a conclusion to   a   general truth from their agreement.
The series of abbreviated syllogisms may be just as clearly
traced in demonstrations      by    algebraic symbols, as in those  irt
which more tedious forms of words are employed. Algebra
is   but the brachygraphy of mathematics; and short -hand
writing implies no peculiarity of reasoning, but merely vo     a
luntary and conventional connection of certain signs with
                                                               certain

certain primary objects, whether sounds, words written in
alphabet, or diilinct existences in nature.                In the higher
parts    of algebra,   and    indeed    throughout     all   mathematics,
are many abbreviations nearly similar to that in which arith
metic substitutes multiplication for addition.                But has not
every    branch    of  knowledge,      in  like manner,       its abbrevia
tions, by means of which its reasonings are brought con
tinually nearer to the quickness and certainty of intuition ?
     IF. All that science does       is,not to create new existences,
to bring into the knowledge of man something that was never
before Known to mind, but merely to observe individuals,
and to form,      by abstraction, general notions           by
                                                             which human
thought may      become     capable   of    amuch    greater number of
individual conceptions than          itcould     by
                                                 other means possibly
 comprehend.        In short, all human science        is  thus reduced to
 arrangement     convenient      to  memory,    and   serving merely, as
it  were, to enlarge the range of the mind's eye. Now, ma
 thematics   is   not     solitary exception
                          a                      :all its discoveries are
 merely discoveries of existence and arrangement.                 A mathe

 tension;   are the two great genera included immediately under
 that genus generaliffimum.           If we pursue lineally extended
 quantity into subdivisions continually lower, we shall find
 next the three species of lineal extension           by
                                                       straight lines, by
 curves, and    by  angles.    Under the species of straight lines are
 all the subordinate species of merely longitudinal extension,
 with their mutual relations and differences.                The species of
 curves has under         all the inferior species of magnitudes or
                          it
 figures, which can be formed and bounded by curved lines
 alone, without the intervention of angles or straight lines.
 The species of angles comprehends, as subordinate, all the
 different sorts of single angles which can be formed               by   the
 meeting of two straight lines. Subordinate to the angle and
 the straight line, jointly, are all those figures complete on all
 sides, which are formed        by  the combination of straight lines
 and angles only.       There is fifth class of subordinate species
                                     a
  referable to the angle, the straight line, and the curve, jointly,
  which includes all the subordinate species of figures, all those
 modes of extension, in which angles, straight lines, and curves
  are combined.        Itwere easy to pursue these subdivisions con
  tinually lower, even to every conceivable diversity, in the
 modes of extension.           It  might be (hown that number            is
 merely arrangement into genera and species, &c. with the
                                                                      fame

same ease    with which this is evinced of extended magnitudes.
But I will not multiply examples of what is so obvious.
   When time is made the subject of mathematical calcula
tion ; it is then considered either as numerical quantity, or as
lineally extended magnitude, or as a combination of the one
with    the other.
   Distances are obviously subjects of mathematical calcula
tion, solely because they are modes of lineal extension.
   Nothing else can be brought under the mere forms of
mathematics without a fiction, that it is either numerical or
lineally extended quantity.
   All the truths of mathematics, antient and modern, pure
and mixed, might be more happily than in any other mode
of exposition unfolded in a systematic arrangement, like that
under which Linnæus has disposed the history of the king
doms of nature, or the table in which the French chemists
contrived beautifully to state the truths and analogies in the
Lavoisierian system of that science.
   I do not at all communicate this, Sir, as any mighty dis
covery. I should only wisti to convince some mathematicians
that naturalists reason just as much as they, and precisely in
the same way; that mathematics, like all other branches of
human science, deals merely in the discernment of existence
and in arrangement ; that it is not, therefore, more remote
than any other science from the common sense and common
utilities of life ; that it has no right to be esteemed the only
science by which the reasoning powers are to be successfully
invigorated ; that its forms may be yet advantageously sim
plified; and, that all its general and specific truths might be
very intelligibly exhibited in one system, and in one or two
grand tables.
   At my first leisure, Sir, I shall take the liberty of addressing

L.   Report given in to the Class of the Mathematical and
    Pbyjical   Sciences of the French National Institute on the
    Experiments of Folia, made the %d of December 1800 *.
 T.   HE first galvanic phænomena consisted of muscular
contractions excited by the contact of a metallic arc. Gal-
vani and several other philosophers considered them as pro
duced by a peculiar electricity "inherent in animal parts.
Volta first announced that the animal arc introduced into
these experiments served only to receive and manifest the in
fluence, but very little, or not at all, to produce it. The mus
 cular irritation, which was at first supposed to be the import
ant part of the phænomenon, was, according to him, only
an effect of the electric action produced by the mutual con
 tact of the metals of which the exciting arc was formed.
 This opinion, which found partisans as well as opponents,
 cansed the experiments proper for supporting or combating it
 to be multiplied ; and, as is always the cafe in the infancy of
discoveries, there appeared, along with facts, a number of
 singular anomalies, which rendered it more difficult to trace
out their connection, and which were then even inexplicable,
 because they arose from very delicate circumstances, the in
fluence of which was not well known.
    Such was the state of this branch of philosophy when the
commission delivered in to. you its first report : its object had
been to determine with accuracy the conditions proper for
calling forth and modifying the galvanic effects ; it did not
attempt to explain them, and confined itself to presenting
them in that order which seemed most proper. At that pe
riod we were not acquainted with the researches by which
C. Volta, pursuing the path he has opened, endeavoured to
connect with his first discovery all the phænomena exhibited
by galvanism.       He has since made known a great many
others, equally important, which he has connected together
by a very ingenious theory ; and if any thing still remains to
be done to determine with exactness the laws of this singular
action, and to subject it to rigorous calculation, the principal
facts at least, which ought to serve as the basis, seem to be
invariably fixed.
    Your commission proposes at present to give an account of
these fundamental experiments, and the method in which
   • The commission
                     charged with this report consisted of Laplace, Cou
lomb,  Halle, Monge, Fourcroy, Vauqudm, Pelletan, Charles, Brisson,
Sabathier, Guvton, anil Biot.
                                                                   Volta

     302            Report  to the French National Institute
     Volta    employed them for the establishment of his theory.
     It   is much indebted to that learned man for the readiness
     with which he repeated them, several times, before the com
     missioners; who can thus vouch for their truth and correct
     ness.     The principal fact, that   from which all the reft may
     be deduced, is as follows :
  s      If  two different metals, insulated, and having only their
   ) natural quantity of electricity, are brought into contact,
'
  )  when removed from that contact they are found m different
     states of electricity : one is positive^ and the other negative.
        This difference, very small at each contact, being accu
     mulated in an electric condenser, becomes sufficiently strong
     to cause the electrometer sensibly to diverge.       The action is
     not exercised at a distance, but only on the contact of dif
     ferent metals 5 it subsists as long as the contact continues,
     but its intensity is not always the fame.      It will here be suf
     ficient to take as examples copper and zinc. In their mutual
     contact the copper becomes negative, and the zinc becomes
     positive.
         Having    proved the development of metallic electricity in
     dependently of any moist conductor, C. Volta introduces
     these conductors.
         If a metallic plate be formed of two pieces, one of zinc
     and the other of copper, soldered end to end ; if the ex
     tremity of the zinc be held between the fingers; and if the
     other, which is of copper, be made to touch the upper plate
     of the condenser, which is also of copper, the latter will be
     charged negatively.       This is evident from the preceding ex
     periment.
        On     the other hand, if the copper extremity be held be
     tween     the fingers, and if the other extremity, which is of
     zinc, be made to touch the upper plate of the condenser,
     which is of copper, when the contact is destroyed, and the
     upper plate is removed, it has not acquired electricity, though
     the lower plate communicates with the common reservoir.
        But if paper moistened with pure water, or any other moist
     conductor, be placed between the upper plate and the zinc
     extremity, the condenser becomes charged with positive elec
     tricity.    It becomes charged also, but negatively, when the
     upper plate, covered with a moist conductor, is touched by
     the copper extremity, holding the zinc extremity between
     the fingers.     These facts are incontestable ; they have been
     verified by the commission.
         The manner in which C. Volta explains them, and refers
      them to the preceding, is as follows :
         Metals, fays he, and perhaps all the bodies in nature,
                                                                exercise.

two metals        : the water, which seems to enjoy this property
in a very weak degree in regard to metallic substances, checks
only a very little the tranfmiflion of the fluid from the zinc
to the condenser, and the latter may be charged positively.
      In the last place, when the condenser is touched with the
extremity of the plate which is of copper, the^moist paper
 interposed, the proper action of which is exceedingly weak,
 does not prevent the metallic plate from conveying a part of
 its metallic electricity into the plate of zinc : then, by de
 stroying the contact, the condenser is found charged nega
  tively.
       From this theory it is easy to explain the Voltaic pile.
 To do it with more simplicity, we shall suppose that it is
  formed on an insulator,          and we shall represent by unity the
 excess of electricity which a piece of zinc ought to have over
 a piece of copper immediately touched by it*.
       If the pile is composed only of two pieces, a lower one of
  copper and the superior of zinc, the electric state of the
  former will be represented by                 £, and that of the second
  by     +  ^-
       If       .      .
           a third, piece be added,       which must be of copper, to
   produce adisplacement of the fluid, the lower piece of zinc
  must be separated by a piece of moist pasteboard; it must
   then acquire the same electric state as the latter ; at least, it
   will be so if we neglect the action proper to the water, which
   appears very small, and perhaps also the very weak resistance
       • The quantities of electricity accumulated in  a body beyond its  natural
   state are, caterh faribus, proportional to the repulsive force with which the
   moleculæ of the fluid tend to separate from each other, or to repel a new
   molecula which one may attempt to add to them.           This repulsive force,
   which in free bodies is balanced by the resistance of the air, constitutes
   what we call the tension of the fluid : a tension which is not proportioned
   to the divergency, of the straws in Volta's electrometer, nor to that of the
   balls in Saussure's, and which cannot be accurately measured by means of,
   the electric balance.
                                                                          which

can oppose to the communication.        The apparatus being in
sulated, the excess of the upper part can be acquired only at
the expense of the piece of copper which is below : the re
spective states of these pieces will be no longer the fame as in
the preceding experiment, and will become,

    Pursuing the same reasoning, the electric state of each
piece of the pile will be sound                   by
                                              supposing       insulated, and

tricity will increase for each of them, from the base to the
summit of the column, according to an arithmetical progres
sion, the sum of which will be equal to zero.
    For the greater simplicity,           ifwe suppose that the number
of the elements      is even,       will
                                    it    be easy to ascertain,          very         by  a
simple calculation,
   That the lower piece which                  of copper, and the upper
                                                    is
piece which     is  of  zinc,   must   be  equally electrified, one more
and the other     less;   and   the  cafe  will be the fame         regard to
                                                                                 in
the pieces taken       at an  equal   distance    from   the  extremities   of
the pile.
   The electricity, before            pastes from positive to negative,
                                     it
will   become    null;    and  there   will always be two pieces, one
of  zinc  and   the  other   of  copper, which will be in the natural
state.    They    will  be  in  the   middle of the pile this           what :            is
has    been  seen  in  the  case  of four   pieces,  for example.
                                                                                               Let

                       on the   Experiments    of Volta.              305
   Let us now suppose that the communication is established
between the lower part os the pile and the common reservoir;
it is evident that in this cafe the lower piece of copper, which
is negatively electrified, will tend to resume from the ground
what it has loft; but its electric state cannot be changed
without that of the upper pieces varying, since the electric
difference of the one from the other mult always be the fame
in the state of equilibrium.  It is necessary, then, that all the
negative quantities of the lower half of the pile should be
neutralized at the expense of the common reservoir; and then
it will result :
   That the lower piece, which is of copper, will have the
fame degree of electricity as the ground, which sliall be re
presented by o ;
   The second piece, which is             of zinc,   and   which immedi
ately touches the preceding,will have + 1 ;
  The third, which is of copper, and which is separated from
the lower one of zinc by a piece of moist pasteboard, will
have, like  it,
              +       1
                      ;
  The fourth, which     of zinc, and which touches the pre
                           is
ceding, will have +
                                  s
                           2\
    And the quantities of the electricity of the different ele
 ments will increase in this manner according to an arithme
 tical progression.
    If the summit of the pile be then touched with one hand,
and its base with the other, these exceff.s of electricity will
 be discharged through the organs into the common reservoir;
and will give     a  slioek the more sensible, as, this loss being
repaired at the expense of the ground, there must thence
 result an electric current, the rapidity of which, greater in
the interior of the pile than in the organs, which are im
perfect conductors, permits the interior part of the pile to
resume  a   degree of tension approaching that which        had in
                                                                it
the state of equilibrium.
    The communication being still established with the com
mon reservoir,    if the summit os the pile be brought into con
tact with the upper plate of         condenser, the lower one of
                                      a
which touches the ground, the electricity, which at that ex
tremity was    in   a very weak degree of tension, will pass into
the condenser, where the tension may be considered as nullj
but the pile being insulated onlv at the expense of the com
mon reservoir, the new quantities of electricity, recovered
 by  the upper plate, will pass into the condenser like the pre
ceding, and will be there, at length, accumulated in such
a  manner, that, by separating the collecting plate, very sen
sible elect rometiie signs, and even sparks, may be extracted.
    Vol. XI.                          U                              In

3o5                      Report to the French National hissitute
   In regard to the limits of this accumulation, it is obvious
that it depends on the thickness of the small stratum of gum
which separates the two plates of the condenser; for, as in
consequence of th)3 thickness the electricity accumulated in
the collecting plate cannot act but at a distance on 'that of
the lower plate, it is always more considerable than that
which forms an equilibrium with it in the latter; and hence
there results in the collecting plate a small tension, which has
here for its limit the tension existing in the upper part of the
pile.
   As the electricity of the column is accumulated in the
condenser,   it will be accumulated in like manner in the in
terior of a Leyden flask, the exterior of which communicates
with the common reservoir; and since, in proportion as the
pile discharges itself, it is recharged at the expense of the
same reservoir, the flask will be equally charged whatever be
its capacity; but its interior tension can never exceed that
which takes place at the summit of the pile: if the bottle be
then removed it will sjive a shock corresponding to that degree
of tension; and this is what is confirmed by experience.
    Such mult be the state of things, neglecting, as very small,
the action proper to the water on the metals ; supposing,
    I   That the transmission of the fluid takes place from
          ft,
one pair to the other in the insulated pile through the pieces
of moist paper     which they are separated, even when there
                              by
exists no communication between the two extremities of the
column          :

   C.  Volta   supports  the   first proposition an experiment by
which we have already mentioned, and in which the con
denser      charged on bringing the collecting plate, covered
                is

   What we have said extends also to all other               bodies between
which there may exist an analogous action              thus, though
                                                             :
this action may appear in general very weak                   between
                                                               liquid
and metallic substances, there are however some, such as the
alkaline sulphurets, the action of which with the metals be
comes very sensible : the English chemists, therefore, have
been able to supply by these lulphurets one of the metallic
elements of the pile ; aud before them professor Pfaff, of
Kiel, employed them for this purpose in his experiments.
/   In this respect, C. Volta has discovered between the me
tallic substances a very remarkable relation, which renders it
impossible to construct a pile with these substances alone. We
shall here explain them according to his account, but we
have had no opportunity of confirming them.
    If the metals be arranged in the following order — silver,
copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc, — each of them will become po
sitive by the contact of that which precedes                 it,
                                                        and negative
with that which follows      it  the electricity will pass then from
                                  :
the silver to the copper, from the copper to the iron, from
the iron to the tin ;   and   soon.
    Now the property in question consists in this, that the
moving force of the silver to the zinc          equal to the moving
                                                     is
forces of the metals comprehended between them in the                        se
ries:   henceit  follows that,        by
                                    placing them in contact in this
order, or in any other at pleasure, the extreme metals will be
always in the fame state as        they immediately touched each
                                  if
other    ;and consequently, supposing any number of elements
whatever thus disposed, and of which'the extremities are for
example silver and zinc, we shall have the same result as                    if
these elements were formed of these two metals; that                to  is
fay, there will be no effect, or          will be that which would
                                           it
have been produced      by  one element.
    It has hitherto appeared that the preceding property ex-%
tends to"all solid bodies, but       does not subsist oetween them
                                      it
and ihe liquids: hence        happens that

division which Volta makes of conductors into two classes                    j
the first comprehending solid bodies, and the second liquids.
                                                                        by

    We have supposed that the moist pasteboards placed between
the elements of the pile are moistened with pure water.            If
instead of water a saline solution be employed, the shock will
become incomparably stronger; but the tension indicated by
 the electrometer does not appear to increase in the same
ratio. C. Yolta has proved to us this fact by the help of his
 apparatus formed of cups, by pouring successively into them
 pure water and acidulous water.
     lie concludes from this experiment that acids and saline
 solutions favour the action of the pile, chiefly because they
 increase the conducting property of the water with which
 the pasteboard is moistened.     In regard to the oxidation, he
 considers it as an effect which establishes a more intimate
 connection between the elements of the pile, and thus con
 tributes to render its action more energetic.
    Such nearly is the substance of the theory of C. Volt a re
 specting that electricity called galvanic.   I J is object has been
 to reduce all the phænomcna of it to one, the existence of
 which is now fully confirmed ; it is the development of me
 tallic electricity by the mutual contact of nwitals.       It seems
 to be proved by these experiments, that the peculiar fluid to
 which muscular contractions and the phænomena of the pile
 were for some time ascribed, is nothing else than the common
 electric fluid put in motion bv.a cause respecting the nature
 os which we are ignorant, though we see its effects.
    Such is the fate of the sciences, that the most brilliant dis
 coveries only open a more extensive sieid for new researches.
 After having     ascertained and estimated, as we may fay, by
 approximation the mutual action of the metallic elements,
 it remains to determine it in a rigorous manner, to discover
 whether it is constant for the fame metals, or whether it
 varies with the quantities of electricity they contain, and with
 their temperature. We must ascertain with the same pre
 cision the peculiar actiou which the liquids exercise on each
 other and on the metals.      It will be then that we can esta
 blish our calculation on exact data; that we can discover the
 real law followed by the distribution and motion of the elec
 tricity in Volta's apparatus, and complete the explanation
 of all the plnrnomena it exhibits. But these nice researches
luquirc instruments more correct than any yet invented by
philosophers to measure the force of the electric matter.
    In a word, it remains to examine the chemical effects of
 the current of electricity, its action on the animal economy,
and its relation with the electricity of minerals and fishes;
researches which, from the facts already known, cannot fail
lo be of very great importance.

    When a science, already far advanced, has made an im
portant (tep, new connections are formed between the branches
of which it is composed : we are always fond of looking back
wards to measure the field it has passed over, and to lee how
the human mind has advanced in it.           If we thus go back to
the birth of electricity, we shall find             it,

ment of the last century, confined merely to the phænomena
of attraction and repulsion alone. Dufay first ascertained the
constant laws to which they are subjected, and explained their
apparent singularities.     His discovery of two kinds of elec
tricity, resinous and vitreous, laid      foundation for the basis

all the phænomena, even that of the Leyden flask, were na

                                           the condenser and elec
trophone.       The rigorous law of electric attraction and re
pulsion, still wanting, was established             by

LI.    Thoughts en the supposed Variations in the Axis and Poles
          of the Earth.      By              Bodjj, of Berlin
I
                                Professor
   T    is  highly worthy of remark, thai, notwithstanding the
harmony which prevails in the course of the planets round
the fun, and in their rotation, as well as in regard to the
parallelism of their axes, great variations are found in the in
clination and position of the latter, and in the periods of the
rotation of these bodies.
    This depends on the different influence which the fun has
on a planet during its rotation, or the variation of its astro
nomical seasons, and on the inclination of its axis in regard
to its orbit ; for the fun, in his course from the one tropic to
the other, pastes over an arch equal to twice the complement
of this inclination; and therefore the less the inclination, he
must advance nearer to the poles, and employ much less time
in proceeding from the equator towards either tropic.
    Now, as it is known from observations that there arc
some planets the axes of which have a much greater or much
less inclination than that of our earth, the great variations
which must naturally thence result in regard to the beneficent
influence os the sun's light and heat, will give a quite different
nature to their fields, productions, and inhabitants.
    The inclination of the axis of our earth, which is 66? de
 grees, seems to be well adapted for promoting its fertility and
 rendering it habitable, as the fun employs six months in
 moving from the equator towards either pole, and again re
 turning; by which means the effect of his rays in producing
 that heat and light so indispensably necessary to the animal,
 vegetable, and mineral kingdom, increases and decreases in a
 much slower and gradual manner. The two temperate zones
 occupy the greater part of the earth's surface, and these re
 main habitable as far as possible towards either pole.
    The direction and inclination of the axes or the different
 planets arc as little proportioned to their different distances
 from the fun, as their periods of rotation, size, density, mass,
 and sphericity ; as is well known by observations which have
 been made. Now, as there must be sufficient grounds for
 this arrangement, it may be ascribed, in my opinion, to the
 matters ofdiflerent specific gravity of which the earth and the
 other planets are composed, and to their mixture; in conse
 quence of which, immediately after their formation, their

               Thoughts on the juppojed Variations,   &c.    311
hemispheres on each fide of their orbit, which always divides
the body in themiddle, were put in perfect equilibrium.
   Our earth as well as every other planet is carried round the
fun by the radius vector, (the straight line drawn from the
planet to the fun,) as the centripetal forces continually act
according to that line, or in a perpendicular direction.    But
this line of attraction, during the revolution of the earth, on
account of the continual parallelism of its axis, forms with
the latter very different angles; and yet the duration and pe
riod of the rotation remain unaltered. This great difference
in the angles has therefore no influence whatever in this re
spect; and it appears that there exists some other great power
capable of preserving the direction and inclination of the axis
unchanged, and which, in my opinion, may be ascribed also
to the sun.
   Our earth during its annual course, revolving from west to
east, turns in succeflion every part of its surface to the sun,
and at the same time revolves from east to west on a line
passing through its centre perpendicular to the plane of its
orbit ; or pafling through the poles of the ecliptic, as a second
axis, for the purpose of constantly maintaining the parallelism
of its proper axis of rotation. Now, if it can be admitted
that the fun produces this revolution of the earth in the plane
of the ecliptic corresponding with the arch of its orbit, this,
in my opinion, is a more natural explanation of the paral
lelism of the earth's axis than when it is considered merely
as the consequence of a certain established position of it inca
pable of alteration ; as this principle is applicable only to the
action of mechanical powers on bodies that move and revolve
in a straight line ; whereas the fun is continually drawing
our earth from the straight line, and carrying it around it in
a cruciform manner.
    According to this theory, we may easily conceive how it is
possible that a planet the axis of which, by the equilibrium of
its heterogeneous parts established at its creation, is put into
a certain direction, subjected   to certain laws, may, by the
powerful influence of the fun, be made to deviate from it so
that its axis stiall assume another position and inclination, or,
in other words, change its poles.
    Our earth, in consequence of (low or sudden variations of
the last kind, would produce in the heavens the following
phænomena :
    ft,
    1     Ifthe inclination of the earth's axis should change,
 the zodiac would be still the fame, but the obliquity of tlie
ecliptic would be greater or less; the equator would pass
through other liars; and,         this cafe, all countries lymg
                                 U in                       under

312           Thoughts   on the supposed    Variations
under the same parallels of latitude would experience a like
change in regard to the duration of the seasons.
    ad, If the axis of the earth, without changing its inclina
tion, should acquire a new direction towards some other
quarter of the heavens, the two points T and ^, where the
ecliptic intersects the equator, and all the other circles con
nected with  it,  would pass through other points of the ecliptic.
This would make no change in the duration of the seasons,
or the state of the fun at noon.
    3d, If the inclination as well as position of the axis mould
be chanced,   a    result compounded of both the above cases
would take place.
   4th, But  if  the earlh should be carried around the sun      in
another plane, the result would be      a  new apparent course of
the sun.     The seasons would remain the fame, or acquire
some change    in   their duration, according as the axis stiould
be inclined as at present, or in    a   different manner towards
the new orbit, and all the countries of the earlh would par
ticipate in this change. These four cases, however, have no
influence on the elevation of the pole of any place.
   5th, On the other hand, stiould the poles of the earth
change their place, the obliquity of the ecliptic would also
be changed, the equator would pass through other countries,
and the elevation of the pole of these countries would be
changed. This change of the pole, however, can take place
only in the direction of some meridian         ;  and consequently
from north to south, and from south to north.             By these
means one half of the equator would be carried over northern
and the other over southern countries; and therefore all coun
tries would not equally participate in the changes thence oc
casioned in the duration of the seasons; at least, al! countries
King under the fame southern or northern zones could not
come together into the torrid zone, or into an uniform
situation.
    If the alteration of the pole should take place      in
                                                         the direc
tion of the meridian that passes through the solstices, neither
the ecliptic nor the different quarters of the earth would ex-
           any change; the obliquity of the former only would
 >e altered as well as the position of the equator in proportion
tierience
to the above alteration. Should the alteration of the pole take
place in the direction of any other meridian,      a  change would
be produced    in    the different quarters of the globe, the obli
quity of the terrestrial equator, and the signs of the eclip
tic.    In the last place, stiould the pole move along the me
ridians pasting through either of the equinoctial points, the
above phænomcna would take place, and the points of the
                                                           ecliptic.

contrive no better hypothesis than to suppose that some de
rangement of the poles of the earth, or changes in the in
clination of its axis, mult have taken place in former times.
    But, in my opinion, the determination of this question
belongs rather to astronomers than to geologists, because by
the former it may be considered under a more general point
of view, viz. what connection exists between the position of
the earth's axis and the fun, and the attractive power in the
solar system ; and what observations have been made in re
gard to the position and direction of their axes, from which,
by analogical reasoning, we mav explain the relation between
causes and effects when such changes take place.
    The ablest astronomers and geometricians have shown that
 the small annual recession of the equinoctial points to the
 welt, of about 51 seconds, and the revolution of the c.rth's
 axis around the poles of the ecliptic, which thence follows in
 the course of 25,700 years, arise from the united action of
 the attractive power of the fun and moon on the spheroidal
 form of the earth. As long, therefore, as this attraction of
 the fun and moon acts in an uniform manner, it seems to be
 impossible that any continued or very perceptible changes in
 regard to the earth's axis can take place.
      It
      is,   however, found  by  observations, that in the course of
  many centuries an alteration, though very small, has taken
  place in the inclination of the earth's axis.     At presentit   is
  zt,   minutes  greater thanit   was in the time of Hipparchus,
  thatis,   above 2000 vears ago.
       In consequence of this observation
                                        it   has been apprehended
  that the ecliptic may', at seme future period, coincide with
                                                               the

314                   Thoughts on the supposed Variations
the equator;  the sun, of course, be continually in the equa
tor;  and the axis of the earth acquire a perpendicular direc
tion ; by which means the cold of the polar regions and in
the temperate zones will become greater, and consequently
the fitness of the earth for being inhabited, as well as its cul
ture and fertility, must decrense.
   But La Grange and La Place have freed us from any un
easiness on this head, as they have proved, by ingenious cal
culations and conclusions, that this small change in the in
clination of the earth's axis is an effect of the mutual attrac
tion of the planets on the orbit of our earth; that since the
time of Hipparchus it has contributed in an uniform manner
to the decrease of the obliquity of the ecliptic, or the increase
of the above inclination ; that it does not always continue ;
but that, properly, the above supposed axis of the earth's ro
tation perpendicular to the ecliptic, in consequence of this
action of the planets, moves in very long periods around the
poles of the orbit of the earth which lie in the neighbourhood
of the poles of the ecliptic.
   According to these observations, the variation in the obli

                                               La Grange's for
mula, that the obliquity of the ecliptic in the period ot 65,000
years always remains between 20° 43' and 270 45'.         At pre

   Hence may be deduced verv important consequences in
regard to the durable state of our earth, on which distant bo
dies, in the course of its annual revolution, exercise an action;
but these bodies, on account of their situation and creat di
stance, are able to produce only very small and periodical nu
tations,         by

and the earth preserved from great and disastrous changes.
As long as the present constitution of the solar system remains
the fame, these small and harmless periodical nutations will
take place.
    But    the earth's axis and its poles are secured

sidered   how trifling such chances are in regard to the whole
earth, and whether its centre of gravity coutd by these means
suffer any alteration.
    A cursory view of geology will show how little we know of
the interior parts of the earth, and how small a portion of it
is subject to our dominion and research.         Of the 21^51,022
square leagues, which is the extent of the earth's surface, the
lands that rife above the ocean comprehend only about one-
third, or seven millions. Now if we suppose, which perhaps
ought to be taken into account, that the height of the land
above the ocean is 6000 feet, or 1 5 mile, (though few lands
are so high;) and that the depth of the ocean is the fame;
this in a globe of one inch diameter would scarcely amount
 to the fiftieth part of a line, or the fifth part of a moderate
sized grain of sand ; and this whole external crust, of 6000
feet in thickness, contains only the 1100th part of the whole
number of cubic miles, which form the solid content of the
earth.
    Now all those traces of revolutions in the earth which
geologists have been able to observe, have been found either
in the above-mentioned crust, into which no one has ever
 penetrated above a fourth part of that depth, (for the greatest
depth to which mines have been dug is not more than 1500
feet;) or in the bowels or at the top of moderate sized moun
tains, the height of which on a globe a foot in diameter
¦would not amount to a grain of sand.
    Can it be supposed that revolutions have taken place in
 this thin crust of the earth capable of altering its centre of
gravity, and at the fame time the place of its poles and its
 axis, so much as some have supposed, in order to account for
various phænomena, such as that of the bones of the ele
phant, &c. being dug up in Germany, and even in Siberia ;
or if,    bysome violent action of the powers of nature     in  the
universe, mountains have been several times overturned, and
 sea and land changed their situation; would these catastrophes,
which must have occasioned great devastation among the
 human race at the periods when they took place, have been
 able in any manner to change the position of the earth's axis
 and of its poles?  By no means  :   they must have been of much
 less consequence,   in that respect, than the devastation which
 an insect would occasion in     a    globe a  foot in diameter bv
 gnawing the paper with which               covered    and who wiil
                                       it

 assert that the centre of gravity of such      a   globe would  by
these means be deranged    ?
  A change in the position of the earth's axis, or of its poles,
can be supposed to take place only v. hen the whole mass of
                                                          which
                                                                      A

 3   16         Thoughts on   the supposed   Variations
 which it   consists is entirely inverted, and its homogeneous and
heterogeneous   parts mixed together in confusion.  But in
this cale, the exterior crust of the earth which we inhabit
would be wholly transformed ; mountains, countries, and
seas, would change their places, and be conveyed     to the
 height or depth of a hundred miles perhaps, and more : and
 how is it possible that man, who can penetrate only to a very
 small depth in the earth, should be able to observe such re
 mains of the old world ?
   Besides, the globe, which is of a spheroidal form, revolves
 round its less diameter, which is five miles shorter.  Now, if
the angle of the inclination of. this aNis should be suddenly
 or gradually changed, its rotary motion would not be de
 ranged, but the obliquity of the ecliptic would be exposed lo
changes, of which, according to observations made at all pe
riods, no traces have been found.      But if the poles of the
earth should leave their place, a new axis would be produced,
the direction of its diurnal rotation would form another equa
tor, and the spherical form would be changed.          But the
immense centrifugal force would be continually producing
the most dreadful revolutions in the land and sea, and the
remains of the antient population would be buried so deep
in   the earth as to escape the researches    of   succeeding       gene
rations.
    The poles of our earth, at present, seem to occupy the most
 commodious positions ; for as, on account of the cold, they
 are uninhabitable to beings of our species, whatever be the
inclination of the earth's axis, the ocean has been assigned
 them as their place, and all the lands of the earth are situated
around them, that, during the daily roiation and annual re
volution of the earth round the fun, its surface may as much
as possible be exposed lo the beneficent effects of that lumi
nary in liis course from the equator towards the poles.          If
we lhould transfer the north pole, for example, lo the middle
of Asia, the south pole would fall in South America, and an
immense tract of cultivated land, on account of the cold,
would be converted into uninhabitable deserts.         It     is,
                                                              how
ever, highly probable,   that the present poles, since the  forma
tion of the earth, as we are at present acquainted with its
surface, consisting of sea and land, have always had the fame
inclination.
   As far as certain astronomical observations go back, and
the antiquity of these amounts to 4450 years, when        aChinese
astronomer observed (exactly according to the precession of
the equinoxes) the (tar a in the northern Dragon in the
neighbourhood of the north pole, no phænumena have taken,
                                                                    plactj

in the present inclination of the earth's axis, which is 66,-°,
Germany, for example, could never be transferred into what
is called the torrid zone. In the first case, if the inclination
should be changed to yo°, the fun in summer would be re
moved about ii,i° further towards the south from that coun
try.    In the second case, if the inclination should decrease-
                                                       °
to 30°, the fun would go to the distance of 60            from the
equator, and in summer pass twice over Germany in a per
pendicular direction; but in winter he would be invisible for
a month, and the cold there would be much more intense
than at present.    On this account, neither the austral plants
nor elephants could ever thrive in such a climate.
   If Germany was ever situated in the torrid zone, or near
the equator, the north pole must have been situated in the
Pacific ocean between Asia and America, and the south pole
at the southern extremity of Africa, more than 3000 miles
from the places which they occupy at present.         The north
east part of Asia must in that cafe have been nearer the north
pole than at present, and Siberia in the temperate zone.
   But as the bones of the elephant have been found under
the earth in the northern parts of Siberia as well as in Ger
many, both countries must have been situated in the torrid
zone: but, in this case, the north pole must have been situ
ated in California, and the south pole in Madagascar, above
4000 miles from their present place.       If the poles were ever
in that situation, it may be asked, If elephants existed then
in Siberia and Germany, where were the forefathers of those
which now exist in the East Indies and Africa r as these
countries at that period must have been in the middle of the
south temperate zone, or partly in the frigid zone.
   Thus there are manifest contradictions in lo readily sup
posing a displacement of the pole, and when the revolutions
which such a change must have produced, in regard to the
surface of the earth and sea, are not taken into consideration.
                                                         A natural

318             Thoughts on the supposed Variations
     A natural consequence follows.        If
                                          our northern districts
of   the earth were ever situated in the torrid zone, a part of
the present torrid zone (for it is not possible that this should
have been the cafe with the whole of              must have occupied
                                                it)
the south temperate zone, or the frigid zone.               If elephants
could exist in those southern districts, at that time forming
the temperate and frigid zone, or         if  Germany and Siberia
were suddenly transported more than four thousand miles to
wards the north pole, could these animals withstand this ge
neral revolution of the surface of the earth and ocean              ?Or,
during this catastrophe, were some of these ponderous ani
mals transported over the land and sea to their present place
of abode, in order to propagate their breed?
    These questions cannot be answered; but are unnecessary,
if  we are convinced, from the principles here explained, that
such displacements of the poles of the earth are not admissible.
    But as the bones of elephants and the remains of austral
plants are found under the earth in northern countries, this
may be explained in the most natural way,             by supposing that
formerly   a   species of these large animals and austral plants
existed in the temperate north latitudes; for         it    certain that
                                                           is
many petrified    (hells and  plants,  as well   as the   impressions of
 insects, are   found   under   the earth,   the   originals of which
 are unknown    ;  or that the  present temperate zone enjoyed in
 the antient   world a  warmer    physical temperature.
    Are there not some proofs, generally speaking, that the
 mass of the cold in the north increases, and that the ice              is
 more and more accumulated in the neighbourhood of the
 north pole ;   that even our vegetables do not possess the fame
 degree  of  perfection, and betray symptoms of degeneration,
 though    the  smallest displacement has never taken place in
 the poles of the earth, and no change in the inc.ination of
 the earth's axis that could have an influence on the climate?
 Is not the cold more widely diffused in the southern hemi
 sphere than in the northern, though both are equally exposed
 to the sun, and though the sun in summer              many thousand
                                                      is
 miles nearer the former than the latter        ?
    The physical climates of the earth however, and particu
 larly the two temperate and two frigid zones, as they are
 far more exposed to the varied influence of the fun's rays
 than the torrid zone, appear to have been subjected to great
 variations at long intervals.       But these depend much on
 local and temporary circumstances, and are not determined
 merely bv the different effects of the fun's influence, in con
  sequence of his annual return.        They are at the fame time,
 owing    to  the  chemical   fermentation     in the mixture of the
                                                                component

solution and decomposition ot these substances so different
in their nature, evaporated from the surface of the earth, whe
 ther land or water, which is filled with animal and vegetable
bodies; and to these vapours being in part conveyed into the
atmosphere, and there converted into other matters, and being
again sent back to it in the form of fertilizing moisture.
    In the last place, all our observations have hitherto shown
 that without the globe of the earth there is no power capable
of producing such irregularities in its poles and its axis.
    Jt was long believed indeed that comets were capable of
producing such revolutions.        Who knows, said some, whe
ther one of these bodies may not have approached too near to
 our earth; and, being furnished with too great attractive
power, may have deranged its axis or its pole, or dragged its
train over us; and, setting everv thing on sire, mav have laid
 waste sea and land, altered the earth's centre of gravity, and
 occasioned  a general  devastation ?
    But our present more accurate knowledge of the orbits and
nature of these celestial bodies will never admit of any suppo
sition of this kind.     It is known from certain experience,
and the consequences thence deduced, that these mafles have
very little specific gravity, and therefore must possess a very
weak attractive power. According to every appearance, they
seem to be composed of minute nioleculæ mixed with the
fine ethereal matter of light, and their trains are only highly
subtile luminous and transparent substances; so that we have
very little to apprehend from either of them.
    No historian worthy of credit ever makes mention of the
disastrous effects of comets on our earth; and mankind are
now too enlightened to be led into error by what the preju
dice, superstition, and ignorance of former times have handed
down to us on this subject.
   Even in modern times comets have passed very near our
earth, without producing any remarkable phænomena,
either in regard to the atmosphere or the common course of
the weather; and much less were the poles or the axis of the
earth any way affected by their approach; otherwise some,
traces of it would not have escaped the researches of the mo
dern astronomers.      On the other hand we know, by expe
rience, that comets which have passed near to our earth, or
the other planets, in their way to the fun, have suffered some
perturbation in their orbits by the attractive power of the
latter.
   I  will not however assert that our earth, before it was
                                                                 v

in consequence of which its poles and its axis may have been
in some measure deranged ; but all the traces of such changes
hitherto discovered in the thin crust within the reach of our
observation seem to prove that they were produced by partial
changes in the situation of certain parts of the land or sea,
                                                                            "

    In the course of a thousand years, revolutions of this kind
may take place in regard to the earth's surface, in cohse-

citing the active powers of nature; but the equilibrium, and
powerful law of mutual attraction, bv which one world is
connected with another, may free us from all apprehension in
regard to any derangement of the poles or axis of the earth
capable of being followed with disastrous consequences.
LI I.   Observations on the Manner in which the Spider (Ara-
  nea Diadema) spins its Web. By M. C. G. Lehmann *.
 I  T must be allowed by those who have any knowledge of
entomology, that the natural history of spiders has been much
neglected; for, notwithstanding the great progress which has
been made in that science, we are as yet verv little acquainted
with the organisation, mode os life, and propagation of the
molt common kinds of these animals ; and many species
make a figure in our systems and cabinets which differ from
each other only by their age or their sex. These insects, so
remarkable on account of their industry and manner of life,
are viewed with a sort of contempt and aversion,                    which
would be inexplicable did we not know the great power of those
imprefiions and prejudices which we receive in our vouth.
These in general are communicated to us by people who are
the least qualified to give the mind that direction necessary
for the purposes of life, and who in particular seem to have
united to inspire us with a dread of spiders.                 Hence the
complaint of so many naturalists, that this aversion always
deters them from observing and accurately examining these
insects; and those who have undertaken to do so have

    generally been obliged to take a great deal of trouble to over
     come this antipathy *.
        But however much mankind mav have beheld with aver
     sion spiders and other vermin, they could not help admiring
    the ingenuity of the latter in spinning their webs, and the or
    der and regularity displayed in these productions.           As far
    back therefore as natural history can be traced, in the time
    of Aristotle, and in the fragments of his predecessors, we
    find, if not accurate descriptions, at least some mention of the
    labours of this infect.       In like manner, the moderns have
    thought the spider's      web   worthy of their attention; and it
    might consequently      have   been expected from the accuracy of
    our naturalists, that they would have given us more minute
    and completer descriptions. This ought to have been the cafe
    in particular with the web of the cross-spider, one of the
    most sinking and most remarkable.              I have several times
    read such descriptions, and studied them with pleasure, be
    cause agreeable to nature; but always found this general
    complaint, that it is still a secret in what manner the cross-
    spider extends its sir It thread, in order that, when it has been
    fastened, it may have a field for carrying on its work.         It is
    well known that the cross-spider           disposes  its web   in   a
    more or less perpendicular direction in some open place.
    Thus, for example, we often find in a window four or five
    threads stretched from one side to the other; from these se
    veral radii proceed to a common centre; and around this cen
    tre, at a distance which may be estimated in general al a few
    lines, there are several concentric circles, each progressively
    larger; in the middle of which the spider places itself con
    cealed, to wait until some insect becomes entangled in these
    threads, when it immediately rustics forth and seizes its
    prey. Thus far the explanation of the process which the spi
    der employs is very easy, especially as it is known that this
.   infect, wherever it goes, marks its way by a thread, which it
    leaves behind it ; and that this thread, on account of its vis
    cosity, can always be made fast to any object, when the f'pi

     monly called natural, and which is meiely the result of improper educa
    tion, on be overcome.         Roscl accustomed himself to view these insects
    first at a distance. He then considered tiicir webs ; and at List looked at th«
    insects themselves through a microscope.           Goze first viewed individual
    pans of spiders, such as the le^s. head, &c. till he was at lenirh able to
    look without any sentiment of aveision at the entire insert.         Both these
    paturalilis. by long habit, so far overcame this aversion, that they cojIJ
    handle and examine spiders with the tame indifferci.ee as others can flies.

     But these webs are commonly found in forests and woods,
often on the high branches of different trees, not unfrequently
 suspended between the roofs of different houses standing near
 each other, and even often extended over streams and ponds
 of water, so that it is impossible to conceive how the spider
 could proceed from the one point to the other, in order to
 establish her first thread, and to fasten to it the different ra
dii. Some have endeavoured to account for this circum
 stance by the most singular suppositions,                  as is commonly the
cafe when philosophers attempt to explain the phænomena
of nature before they have examined them with sufficient ac

 hypotheses,      which contradict themselves *. Accident,                       to
 which we arc indebted for most of our discoveries, particu
 larly in natural history, though we are unwilling to allow
 it any stiare in our discoveries, gave me arc opportunity of
making an observation which decides the above question. On
 a warm fummer'js             evening [ saw a cross-spider (aranea di-
 ademaj let herself speedily down from a branch of a tree by
her usual thread; and at the same time a multitude of similar
threads, which had their origin at the fame place as the
other, floated around; while the air, which was not percep
tible to my fenses, carried them to a considerable distance,
and even a considerable height. Though I approached with the
utmost gentleness, the direction of the floating threads was
immediately changed, and in a moment they had reached a
neighbouring branch, to which they adhered.                            The spider
soon     observed     thit    her    floating  threads      had  reached    a fixed
point,     and   immediately         clambered     up   to   them,   having thus
 given    me    an   opportunity        of  feeing    the   secret  of  the com
 mencement        of   her   ingenious     labour.       Guided     by  this trace,
 it was now easy       for   me    to  make   my    observations     with  Weater
 accuracy; and the result of them is as follows.                          When a
 spider    is  desirous    of    proceeding     to  a  distant   place, she sud
 denly lets herself down by a pretty strong thread, and al the
 fame time draws one of her hind legs over the glandular
 parts which contain the materials of her web. By these means
 ihe forces from them a great number of small threads, and
 consigns them to the air; which, on account of their spe
 cific siditness, makes them float, so that they remain at that
              only mention one. — Lister in his Hist. Animal. Angliit, which
    * I lhdll
contains n threat many important observations on Ipiders, explains this,
c 7, as an tjuculatio filorum, and endeavours to make it more evident, by
ronipaiin^ u to the manner in which the fun emits his rays.
                                                                            height

 tory to he able to determine whether this observation has be •
 fore been made by others * ; but by some questions in the
 Hanoverian Magazine, and by the private information of
 distinguished naturalists, it appears that it is not generally
 known. But whether it be new, or may only serve to con
 firm what has been already remarked, I am happy that                       I
 have it in my power to point out to other searchers into na
 ture how they may at all times be convinced of the truth of
 what I have here stated.          If a person takes a spider from its
 web, and places it on the hand, it will endeavour to escape
 from this warm object as a place of danger, and let itself
 down in the manner above described ; but if one of the
 threads that float about in the air bo laid hold of by the other
 hand, the spider suffers herself to be drawn over by it; and
 this experiment can be repeated several times, till at length,
 scared by being so often deceived, (he throws herself loose,
 and suffers herself to fall to the ground.
    To these observations on the manner in which the spider
 begins her web, I {hall add some others, which indeed com
 prehend but a small part of the important discoveries that
 Quatremere Disjonval pretends to have made ; and respecting
 which, since the attention of naturalists is called to this sub
ject,    I hope to obtain further information.               The account
 that various kinds of spiders foretell changes of the weather
 several davs before they take place, excited my whole at
 tention ; and { was the more desirous of studying the arane-
ology of the above observer, as I was always of opinion that
 those insects which have organs peculiarly adapted for per
ceiving changes in the state oT the air         t  would be capable of

giving us the best and earliest information respecting changes
in the weather. It was impossible for me at first to procure
Disjonval's work ; and my curiosity began to be lessened
when I heard that no person was able lo comprehend it.
 For this reason I resolved to make observations myself; and
with this view I collected a great many of the aranea dia-
dema and aranea domejlica,      as the latter are those which
Disjonval   must have  had  the  best opportimity of observing
when in prison. The latter showed no alteration in their1
web or their conduct, but in regard to the former I soon
 had an opportunity of making very important observations.
 I have already mentioned what every body knows, that this
spider commonly fits in the middle of its web.      I now found-
that she often extended a thread from the centre of her web,
that is the usual place of her residence, to the nearest cor
ner ; in which she concealed herself, instead of being in
the web : and I always remarked, that this change was
 connected with a change of the weather, as all mv cross-
spiders made the fame change together; and immediately af
ter the weather became very raw and cold. It is indeed very
natural that those insects, when they have a presentation of
 bad weather, stiould endeavour to shelter themselves from it.
 Hut my observations were too much interrupted by business
 and various circumstances, and I was too         provided with
                                                          ill
 good instruments for comparing the state of the weather and
 of the atmosphere, such as barometers, thermometers,                                  hy
 grometers, &c. to be able to fay any thing decisive on the
 subject.   What    have said will however furnisti
                     I                                    hint to        a
 others who may be disposed to carry these researches further.
    The fame opportunity enabled me to make another obser
 vation, of which      do not recollect ever to have heard or
                         I
 read, viz. that the cross-spider    regularly destroys its web
 everv twenty-four hours, and in the place of the old substi
 tutes   anew one. This     always does in the night-time, but
                               it
 suspends the renovation of     when it cloudy state of the wea

 when any mechanical obstacles stand in the way*.            This

The cause may be easily conceived from what           have said.
                                                      I            For several
years, during the summer,     I resided in    house situated
                                              a                 ingarden
                                                                     a      and    ;
opposite to the window, which was generally open,         large spider had ex
                                                          a
tended her web.   I    took great care not to destroy it, because    served in-
                                                                         it
stead of one of those gauze screens which aic commonly employed to keep
out flies and gnats.    The web     inthe day-time was frequently injured               by
accidents, but next morning    I  found it always repaired.      One morning,
                                                                                   having

                        the Spider spins its Web.                       325
observation has thrown ffreat light upon many things relating
to the natural history or spiders.          It points out the principal
method which ought to be pursued in making observations
on the weather by means of these insects, as they construct
no new web after destroying the old, when impeded by the
unfavourable state of the weather. This also enables us to
explain why we often observe floating about, during very hot
days,     prodigious multitudes of spiders webs, commonly
known under the name of go/satner, and which has given oc
casion to so much dispute among philosophers ; for it may
be readily conceived, when we reflect how numerous spiders
are, what a multitude of these webs must be let loose, when
they all destroy their webs at the fame time, in order to con.
struct new ones.         During cloudy weather none of them are
to be seen, for at such periods none are let loose ; and even if
there are a few of them in the atmosphere,               they acquire hea
viness fr.im the moisture they imbibe, of which they are very
susceptible, and of course fall to the earth.                I was enabled
also to determine the dispute respecting the organs of vision
in spiders. They undoubtedly have eyes, which are indispenr
sably necessary for the functions they have to perform, and
yet they do not seem to observe when a stick or other dan-
            weapon is held close to these organs, but they in-
ferous
   antiy   retreat  when in the least touched.           At present, how
ever, this circumstance can be easily explained, for these in
sects are nocturnal animals.             In the night-time they spin
their webs, and during the morning and evening twilight
catch the greatest number of insedts.                   In the night they
having got up earlier than usual, I saw the spider at day-break destroy all
the concentric threads proceeding from the centre outwards along the ra
dii, breaking off with her feet the cross threads which she cemented to
the radii the had left untouched ; and which, by these means, became pro
gressively thicker.    She did the same with the principal threads by which
the web was made fast; and which, in consequence of the threads added
to them, were rendered much stronger.      The smallest flies or gnats which
attempted to enter through the window were therefore raught fast in the
net ; but towards noon, Or somewhat later, the flies became shyer, and no
more were caught.      The spider therefore about that time retired to a cor
ner which she had prepared in the window, where (he laid her eggs, and
where (he remained quiet till the next morning.       This observation (hows
that the threads of the web lose their viscosity by the sun's rays and the
 heat of the weather ; and becoming too dry and hard to be fit for catching
those   insects on which the spider feeds, (he is under the neceifity of re
 newing them. On the other hand, the principal threads, which serve only
for strengthening the web, have    no need of being renewed.      Damp wea
ther may perhaps render these webs as unfit for catching insects as the
 heat does, and therefore the spider thinks it unnecessary  to renew her web
as long as tkat temperature continues.

time, like those birds, they are dazzled by the too great splen
dour of the light.            But at that lime they have no need of
very acute fight, as they seldom leave their web ; and, when
they do, are conducted back to it by their delicate sense of
touching.         Besides, they seldom have occasion for it in the
day-time, as their webs are then too visible to the insects
which they catch ; so that the latter can be better on their
guard against them than they can during the twilight.

                         I.   Historical Introduclion.
  § *•    X HE        science relating to the peculiar action of dif
 ferent conductors of electricity on each other, has lately ex
 cited a considerable degree of attention in the philosophical
 world.
      Owing its origin to the phænomenon discovered by Gal-
 vani f, the production of muscular contraction by the ap
 plication os metals to the nerves and muscles of animals, it
 has derived its name from that philosopher.
      Galvanism was at first limited in its application to organ
 ized bodies; but, in consequence of the labours and inven
 tive genius of experimentalists, our contemporaries, it has
 gradually become connected with chemistry and general phy
 sics ; it has afforded powerful instruments of investigation ;
 and its operations have been traced throughout the whole of
  nature.
      In giving an account of the progress of this science, in its
  relation to the powers of the human mind, it will be suffi
  cient to notice such experiments only as have derived their
  origin from extensive theoretical views, and such discoveries
  as nave led to accurate        generalisations of pliænomena already
  known.
      Though the history of galvanism extends only through the
  period of the last nine years, yet we may notice jn it four
  epochs, each of them distinguished               by the development of

facts, variously interesting from their novelty and the extent
of their application.
   § 2. Considering the first epocli as formed by the publica
tion of the fundamental galvanic fact, we may derive the
second from the discovery of the existence of inorganic gal
vanism. Till the researches of Fabroni, Dr. Ash, and Creve,
had been made known, the galvanic influence was generally
considered as existing only in living animal organs.     But the
discovery  of the peculiar action of metals in contact with each
other upon water, demonstrated the production of it in ar
rangements composed wholly of dead matter, and laid the
foundation for a new class of investigations, which have inti
mately connected the galvanic phænomcna with known phy
sical effects.
                                                                          is,

celebrated on account of the discovery of the accumulation
of the calvanic influence. Before this discovery was made,
the worldj in general, beheld nothing deeply interesting in
galvanism     : had no relations to the common wants of life,
                  it
and the facts that composed        were   itobscure as lo be diffi
                                                    so

                                      long attention.     The gal
vanic battery of Volta not only gratified the paflion for no
        bythe curious effects   produced, but likewise awakened
                                  by it
velty
the love of investigation,      distinctly exhibiting the analogy
between galvanism and common electricity.
  §   4. The fourth and last epoch in galvanism may be con
sidered as founded upon the knowledge of the general con
nexion between the excitement of galvanic electricity, and
chemical changes; and         chiefly owes its existence to the
                                it
labours of British experimentalists*.        The discovery of the
chemical agencies of galvanism has led to researches which
finally cannot fail to elucidate the philosophy of the impon
derable or ethereal fluids. The year that       just past will long

sical investigation been pursued with greater ardour; and                         if
new facts, T)y being sometimes insulated and incapable of
 application to establislied theories, have perplexed the public
mind, yet they have at the fame time been useful to              by         it,
 producing    habit of rational and active scepticism, which
               a

on each other, are capable of producing galvanic effects,
may be divided into two classes *.          The one class comprises
what may be called perfect conductors, oxidable metallic
substances and charcoal : the other includes less perfect con
ductors, which are either oxidated fluids, or substances con
taining these fluids.                           »>
    The simplest galvanic arrangements require for their forma
tion at least two bodies of the fame class and one of a different
class *.    With regard to the form of their aggregation, they
must be so disposed, that the bodies of the one class may be
in contact with each other, in one or more points, at the
fame time that they are connected in other distinct points
with the body of the other class.
/ § 2. The simple galvanic circles may be divided into twp
general kinds.
    The first is formed by two different metallic substances, or
one metallic substance and charcoal, and a peculiar fluid.
    The second is composed by two different fluids and one
metallic substance.
    Thus, if plates of zinc and of silver be made to touch in
one point, and be connect ed together in other points by a
portion of common water or of muriatic acid, a galvanic
simple circle is formed of the first order.
     Or if separate portions of nitric acid and of water, moisten
 ing pieces of. cloth or bibulous paper, be brought in contact
with each other on a small surface, at the same time that
other surfaces of them are connected with different parts of
 a plate of tin, a circle of the second kind is composed f.
     § 3. All arrangements, however, of two conductors of one
 class with one of the other, are not capable of producing gal
 vanic effects : and even the powers or acting circles are very
 different in degree.       It appears from all the facts, that
 chemical changes taking place in some of the parts of the
 circle are intimately connected         with its agencies.       For,
 though    a  momentary    circulation   of  galvanic   influence may
 possibly be produced by the contact of three different bodies,
 vet it appears most likely that the permanent excitation of it
 depends upon a certain exertion of their chemical affinities.
     The most powerful circles of the first kind are those com
 posed of two solids ot different degrees of oxidability,       and of
  a fluid capable of oxidating at least one of the solids \. And,
  even in the, feeblest circles, it appears that some chemical
  action is uniformly exerted either by oxidating fluids or solu
 tions of alkaline sulphurets.
     Thus silver and gold do not appear to evolve galvanic in

of acting chemically upon either of the metals ; though
when they are connected with water, holding in solution
nitric acid, or any other fluid decomposable by silver, they

atmospheric air or acids \.

which the different substances are arranged according to the

    § 4. Arrangements, exactly similar in their action to the
 common simple circles, may be formed by the combination
of more than three conductors. For, that simple galvanic
 action may be evolved, nothing more is apparently requisite,
than that the points of contact between the solid and fluid
parts of the circle, i. e. the places where chemical affinities
are liable to be exerted, be immediately preserved; at the
same time that those parts are respectively homogeneal, or
composed        respectively     of similar conductors.       Thus zinc,
silver, iron, gold, and water, arranged in a circle, in the
order of their enumeration, produce action exadtly analogous
to zinc, gold, and water. And nitrous acid, water, solution
of caustic potash, solution of sulphuret of potash, and silver,
evolve galvanic influence in the same manner as nitrous acid,
water, solution of sulphuret of potash, and silver.
    It appears, however, that the length aud surface of the
conducting series, connecting the exciting parts of the circle,
are in some measure related to the Quantity of action it is
capable of exhibiting.            This law, indeed, applies only ana
logically    to  perfect   conductors;    though, with regard to im
perfect conductors,         it is  demonstrated    experimentally ; as in
all cafes a diminution of power, in some unknown ratio, is
produced by the increase of the length, or, whatis apparently
equivalent, the diminution of the surface of the chain which
they compose.
   The limits of surface, and of length, of imperfect conductors

                      Outlines os a View            of Galvanism.                    331
in circles, connected with       the maximum and minimum of
their activity,          not been yet ascertained ; and there is
                        have
everv reason to believe that they will be different in different
imperfect conductors.       Thus, portions of sulphuric acid and
of nitrous acid will probably form better conducting series
than similar portions of water ; and a chain of water will
perhaps act better than an equal chain of water mixed with
alcohol.
     From several experiments, it would appear that the powers
of circles are particularly connected with the extension of the
 surfaces of contact between the perfect and imperfect con
 ductors.
      § 5. All galvanic influence in single circles is manifested
 either by its efficiency in affecting living animal organs,
 forming part of the arrangement; or by its power in modi
 fying the chemical changes produced by the action of the
 perfect on the imperfect conductors.
      A. When one fluid part of a powerful single circle is made
  to touch the tongue at the fame time that another fluid part
  is connected with some irritable surface of the body, an acid
  taste is perceived*, which becomes less distinct in propor
  tion as the contact is longer preserved.
      If the eye be made part of the galvanic circuit, a transient
  flash of light is produced at the moment the chain is com
  pleted  f ; and, when the bared      cutis is employed, a faint
  painful sensation uniformly denotes the circulation of the
  galvanic influences. .
      But the most distinct mode of exhibiting, by animal ex
   citement, the existence of small quantities of galvanic power,
   is by connecting one part of the circle with a nerve, and an
   other part with a muscle, in a limb just separated from the
   body of a living animal.       In this cafe, whenever the con
   nection of the arrangement is made or broken, muscular
   contractions are produced §.
       B. In galvanic simple circles all primary chemical action
   taking place between the imperfect and perfect conductors
   is apparently increased by their galvanic arrangement. Thus
   zinc, which oxidates when in contact with common water
   alone, oxidates much more rapidly when forming a galvanic
   circle with it by means of gold, or other difficultly oxidable
   metals       Ana tin appears to dissolve faster in diluted nitric

    C. But increase of primary chemical action is not the onlv
 inorganic effect of galvanism ; for it changes the nature of
 this action in a very peculiar manner.        In the oxidating
 circle with common water, no perceptible quantity of hy
 drogen is evolved, as in common processes; but an alkaline
substance appears to be formed at the point of contact of the
 least oxidable perfedt conductor with the fluid. Thus, if zinc
 and stiver he made to form a circle with distilled water, hold
ing in solution air, for many weeks, a considerable oxidation
of the zinc is perceived, without the perceptible evolution of
        and the water, at its point of contact with the silver,

juice, and of rendering turbid, solution of muriate of mag

    In the oxidating circles with acids, gas not only evolved       is
from the parts of the conductors undergoing chemical change,
but likewise from other parts in which no primary action
apparently exists.   Thus, when zinc and silver form circle                     a
with diluted muriatic acid, gas        not only given out at the
                                                      is
points of contact of the acid with the zinc, but likewise at
the place where          connected with the silvers.
                        it    is                           And in
the circle with tin, gold, and diluted nitric acid, nitrous gas
is evolved from the gold as well as from the tin *.
   D. Indeed in all the single galvanic circles, whenever an
oxidating influence      exerted at one of the places of contact
                              is
of the perfect and imperfect conductors, deoxidating action     a
appears to be produced at the other place.      Thus, when iron,
which oxidates rapidly when forming        circle with stiver and
                                                           a
common water,        arranged with zinc and common water,
                         is
it remains perfectly unaltered, whilst the zinc      rapidly acted       is
upon.

                                            the simple galvanic
circles cannot well be theorized upon, except in the laws of
their connection with the more complicated and more
striking galvanic facts.    And        from the discovery made
                                                 it   is
by   Volta, of the accumulation of galvanism only, that the
instruments of investigation are derived,        means of which  by
the nature of this influence     known,   and
                                            is its most important
agencies and relations ascertained.
III. Of Compound              Galvanic Circles,            or   Galvanic Batteries.
 §   1. The instruments for accumulating galvanic power,
or the compound galvanic circles, are composed of the same
elements as the simple circles; but those elements are dis
posed     different form os aggregation.

   To compose a galvanic batterv, series of the conductors
capable of forming simple circles arc required. And they
must be arranged in such a manner, that the conductors of
the fame class in every series may be in contact with each
other, in one or more points, at the fame time that they are
respectively connected with different conductors of the other
class, and one of them belonging to the fame series, a re
gular alternation being observed.
   Thus, the order of a compound galvanic circle        conductor     is,
of the one class, conductor of the one class, conductor of the
other class; conductor of the one class, and          on, in uni   so
form arrangement.
  §   2. The compound galvanic circles, like the simple cir
cles, may be divided into two general orders.
   The first order       composed of series, containing, at least,
                                  is
two perfect conductors, and one imperfect conductor.          The
second      formed
           is           arrangements, consisting of not less than
                                  by
two imperfect conductors, and one perfect conductor*.
   Thus,      plates of zinc, and of silver, and pieces of cloth,
                if
of the size of the plates, moistened in water or diluted mu
riatic acid, be arranged in the order of zinc, silver, cloth;
zinc, silver, cloth and so on, till twenty series are perfectly
                              ;
connected,       galvanic battery
                     a              formed of the first class
                                              is                             f.
   And      ifplates of copper, and pieces of cloth, moistened,
some in water and some in solution of sulphuret os potash,
be connected in          circle,  a the order of copper, cloth
                                             in
moistened in water, cloth moistened          solution of sulphuret
                                                         in
of potash, and       on,  so compound circle will be funned of
                                       a
the second class          J.
   The most elesrant mode, however, of arranging the metals
of compound circles with fluids,   bv means of vessels com
                                                    is
posed of electrical nonconductors, such as glasses, or boxes
formed of baked wood.
   Thus, plates of copper and of zinc, paired, and soldered
together   their edges, may be cemented into
                at                            trough com          a
posed    baked wood, in regular alternation, and in such a.
           of
manner as to leave      number of water-tight cells corre
                                       a
sponding to the number of series.    And this arrangement
will become active when the cells are silled with water or
salinesolutions, and                   when the extreme metals are properly
connected            §.
  Or, instead of the double plates, single plates of copper
and of horn, or glass, may be used in uniform alternation                          ;
when the cells must be filled with different fluid chemical
agents in the regular order,                   so
                               as to be connected   together

  plates*.
     § 3. The substances most active in the single circles are
  likewise most active in the compound circles.       And in all
  cafes, the relative quantities of galvanic power, exhibited by
  equal numbers of different series, are, in some measure, pro
  portional to the intensity of the peculiar primary chemical
  agencies,       exerted by the different conductors composing
    them, on each others.
      Thus, in the battery with zinc and silver, there is little
   or no action produced, when the connecting fluid is pure
    water, or water holding in solution hydrogen gas, which is
   incapable of acting on the metals f. The action is greater
    with water saturated with oxygen % than with water saturated
   with atmospheric air ; and it is most intense when solution
   of red sulphate of iron, or of nitric acid, is employed.
      The tables of the single circles will indicate, with the ne
   cessary change of arrangement, the relative                powers of the
  series forming compound circles.
      § 4. Provided those places of contact in the compound
   circle, in which the peculiar chemical changes are produced,
   remain permanent, the parts of the series which do not im
   mediately act chemically on each other, may be connected
   together in the fame manner as in single circles, by means
  of conductors of their own class, without any alteration of
   the nature of the agencies.
      Thus, in the circle with copper, iron, and water, the
  copper and iron may be connected by means of a wire of
  brass §.      And even the continuity of the portions of water
  may     be broken    by moist muscular fibre, and other imperfect
  conductors, without any other change in the effect than a
  diminution of its intensity        ||.
   §     5. The galvanic influence, when highly accumulated,
  produces very extraordinary chemical and physical effects,
              many of its appearances, assumes the precise form
  and,  in
  of common electricity.
      A. When      in   a  powerful battery (one, for instance, con
  taining    two    hundred   series) the communication,          after being
  broken,     is   again  rendered     complete     by  the   contact  of two
  perfect    conductors,    a    flash   or  spark   of  lightis    perceived
  analogous to that produced               by
                                            electricity  §.   This spark, or
  flasti, when the battery      is  most powerful,   is   capable of pasting

  will  be exactly analogous to those produced in the series with
  plates ; silver, and all the more oxidable metals, oxidating
  in water, in the usual place ; and gold and platina evolving
  oxygen gas.
     Thus, when into two small glass tubes, connected by moist
  animal substance, and silled with distilled water, two gold
 wires are introduced from a large battery, in the proper
 order, oxygen is produced in one quantity of water, and
 hydrogen in the other, nearly in the proportions in which
 they are required to form water by combustion *.                  And if
 the process be continued for some time, the apparatus being
 exposed to the atmosphere,         the water in the oxygen-giving
 tube will become impregnated with an acid (apparently the
 nitrous) ; whilst that in the hvdrogen-giving tube will be
 found to hold in solution an alkali, which, in certain cases,
 has appeared to be fixed \.
     From some experiments it would appear probable that
 the quantities of hydrogen produced in series are small, and
 the quantities of alkali great, in proportion as the surfaces of
 contact of the least oxidable metals with the water are more
 extended    *.
     All  the oxygenated solutions of bodies possessing less affinity
 for oxygen than nascent hydrogen, are decomposed when
 exposed to the action of the metal occupying the place of the
least oxidable part     of a series in the compound circle.
    Thus, sulphur may be produced from sulphuric acid ; and
copper and other metals precipitated in the metallic form
from their solvents J.
    But little knowledge has yet been obtained concerning the
chemical changes taking place in the second class of galvanic
batteries. But from several experiments it would appear that
they are materially different in the laws of their production
from those taking place in the first class.
    Thus, when single metallic wires with water are placed
as series in powerful batteries of the second order, the in
fluence producing oxygen seems to be transmitted by the
point, in the place of that part of the plate, which was ap
parently incapable of undergoing oxidation; whilst the hy
drogen is evolved from that point, where the oxidating part
of the primary series appeared to exist §.

production of fixed alkali in the experiment detailed in the text.

   § 6. The agency of the galvanic influence, which occa
sions chemical changes, and communicates electrical charges,
is probably, in some measure, distinct from that agency
which produces sparks, and the combustion of bodies.
   The one appears (all other circumstances being similar)
to have little relation to surface in compound circles, but to
be great, in some unknown proportion, as the number of
series are numerous.     The intensity of the other seems to be
as much connected with the extension of the surfaces of the
series, as with their number.
   Thus, though eight series, composed of plates of zinc and
copper, about ten inches square, and of cloths of the fame
size, moistened in diluted muriatic acid, give sparks so vivid
as to burn iron wire; yet the shocks they produce are hardly
sensible, and the chemical changes indistinct *.        Whilst
twenty-four series of similar plates and cloths, about two
inches square, which occasion shocks and chemical agencies
more than three limes as intense, produce no light whatever.
   § 7. A measure" of the'intensity of the power in galvanic
batteries, producing chemical changes, may be derived from
the quantity of gas it is capable of evolving from water in a
given time; or from the length of the fluid chain through
which it can be transmitted.      For the lame law of diminu
tion of activity that was applied to single circles in § 4.
p. 330, may be likewise applied to compound circles.
   The general relative forces of different batteries may be
ascertained by connecting them in opposite orders, so as to
produce a certain annihilation of power.        For in all cafes
when the most oxidable part of one series is placed opposite
to the fame part of another equal series, and connected with
it by means of a fluid, the galvanic agencies of both are de
stroyed.
                  IV.      General Observations.
   § 1. From a valuable experiment lately madef, it appears,
that, when common electricity is pasted through water, by
means of two very sine metallic points, chemical changes
                it,                                  by  the trans
are effected by      analogous to those occasioned
mission of the galvanic influence.
   This fact, singly, presents   a
                                    very "strong analogy between
galvanism   and  the   common    electrical influence; and, when
compared    with   the  other  facts, it amounts    almost to
                                                            a   de
monstration of their identity.

tions in the surfaces and conducting powers of bodies.
   The circulation of electricity in galvanic circles, from its
different points of excitation, appears to depend, in a great
measure, upon certain specific attractions for            in the dif
                                                                   it,

   This fact will, perhaps, in some measure, lead to an ex
planation of the cause of the accumulation of galvanism in
compound circles.       For, in those circles, all the series are so
constituted   as   to produce          a   perfect correspondence         between
the electricity excited          by
                            chemical action, and that produced
by  compensation.
 §   3. The general chemical agency of galvanism            at pre       is
sent involved in obscurity.     The facts relating to the separate
production of oxygen and hydrogen, acid and alkali, in
water, are totally incommensurable with the usually received
theory of chemistry.     And, even supposing that the appear
ance of th'e two last of these bodies         connected with the
                                                        is
presence of atmospheric air,           still extremely difficult to
                                           it   is
conceive, that either oxygen or hydrogen can pass in an in
visible form through fluids or organic bodies.          Common
physical ficts present us with no analogies sufficiently distinct
to enable us to reason on this subject; and the elucidation of
it will probably be connected with perfectly new views of
corpuscular action.
   §4. The appearance of galvanic action in living matter,
particularly in the torpedinal organ, leads to curious inqui
ries. Chemical changes are perpetually going on in different
parts of the living body, which must be connected with altera
tions in their states of electricity; and organized beings con
tain all the tubstances requisite for forming species of galvanic
                  These circumstances, combined with the facts

                                                                                    of

                 Outlines       of   a   View of Galvanism.       339
of the production of muscular contraction by common gal
vanism, and the dependance of irritability, and even life,
upon the oxvgenation of the blood, afford analogies which
render it probable that some phænomena similar to the gal-
vanic phænomena may be connected with muscular action
and other processes of life. These analogies, however, at
present are very indistinct ; and they ought to be considered
of importance only so far as, they are likely to lead to the dis
covery of new instruments of experimental investigation.
                                     Conclusion.
   The relations of galvanism to the different branches of
physical science are too numerous and too extensive to be
connected with the preceding details ; and, although in their
infancy, they will probably long constitute favourite subjects
of investigation amongst philosophers, becoming the sources
of   useful discoveries.
     The new galvanic      facts have given an importance to the
science    sufficient to render it interesting, and to ensure its
progression.      The spirit of inquiry is awaltened in the public
mind, and it is difficult to imagine the existence of causes
capable of destroying it.
    Galvanism may be pursued with greater facility than most
of the other sciences; it requires less time and attention ; it
is less connected with manual labour, and the most delicate
organs are the best fitted for performing and observing its
operations.
    The instruments required for galvanic experiments are few,
and but little expensive.       A battery composed of fifty plates,
when arranged with chemical agents, forms a combination
sufficiently powerful for common experiments.             With such
a combination, a few glass tubes having gold wires attached
to them, and a gold leaf electrometer, mav investigations be
pursued, and principles discovered, extending not alone to
the laws of dead matter, but even to those of animated nature.

it  might be stated, that its agencies are likely, at some period,
to become useful           in
                           the arts.     When our galvanic instru
ments are rendered more perfect and more powerful, we may
be readily enabled,          means of them, to procure the pure
                            by

   J}y   Mr. Davy
!•   IF   a piece of well burned charcoal be brought in contact
at one of its surfaces with a portion of water, and at another
surface with a portion of nitric acid, a simple galvanic com
bination will be formed when the two fluids are connected
together : and the powers of it are demonstrated by its agen
cies upon the limbs of frogs, and by its effects upon the organs
of   fense.
    2. A compound galvanic combination or a galvanic bat
tery may be formed from a number of series composed of the
same substances:              but in this cafe the fluid elements of each
scries, not being immediately in contact, must be connected
with similar elements in other series in an order of regular
alternation, such as water, charcoal, acid j water, charcoal,
acid   ; and     so    on.
    3. The      best mode that has yet occurred of constructing
galvanic batteries with charcoal, is by means of a number of
glasses, which are made to contain, alternately, nitrous acid
and water, and which are connected in pairs by means of
moistened cloth. The pieces of charcoal used are made from
very dense wood, such as box or lignum vitæ ; and in this
 case, the fluids will not penetrate into them by capillary at
traction much beyond the places of their primary contact.
Their forms arc those of arcs, so that each piece connects
together two glasses; but in instances where single pieces of
 charcoal cannot be obtained of the proper shape, two long
 and thin slips may be fastened together by silk, so as to form
the angle neceflary             to their insertion into the glasses.

  but feeble mocks, and when a single metallic series with a
  gold wire and two glasses of water is substituted for one of the
  primary series, hydrogen is given out by the metallic point
  in the glass of water in the place of the acid, whilst oxygen
  is evolved from the point in the other glass.
      5. In the galvanic batteries with charcoal, sulphuric acid
  may be substituted for nitric acid ; and solution of sulphuret
  of potash for the water, without any material alteration in
  the nature of the agency ; the solution of the sulphuret in
  deed, seems, in some measure, to increase its intensity, and
  combinations containing this substance, dense charcoal, and
  concentrated nitric acid, appear to be superior in activity to
  similar combinations containing copper, and the fame fluid
  elements, and to be nearly equal to those composed of zinc,
  frlver, and water.

      other.   JByDARRACa, Pupil of Vauciuelin, and his
      Affi/lant In the School of Mines*,
    JL H E     analysis  of stones has long engaged the attention of
 chemists.     The   moderns,    assisted by more correct instruments,
 have     carried   this  branch   'of chemistry to such a degree of.
 perfection, as seems to leave nothing more to be desired ; but
 C. Guyton, in a memoir, in which he treats with minuteness
 on the different affinities which the earths exercise on each
 other, relates several observations, printed in the 27th number
 of the Annales de Cbimie, which excite great doubt in regard to
 the exactness of the analyses hitherto made, and which invite
 all chemists to be on their guard, left they should take a simple
 earth for a mixture of several.             The embarrassment which
 these affinities daily gave rife to, determined me to examine,
 with great care, the different circumstances under which they
 may take place; for, if it is of importance to point out these
 new combinations, it is no less so to reduce them to their
just value.
     Exp. I. C. Guyton having mixed ten centilitres of lime
 water with two centilitres ot barytes water, there were soon
 formed white clouds, which united, and deposited themselves
 at the bottom of the vessel containing the mixture.           In con- ¦

342             On the Affinity os Earths for   eaob other.
sequence of this experiment he admitted an affinity between
lime and barytes.
     I  repeated the fame experiment with great care ; but ob
tained no change in the liquors mixed, nor any sign of pre
cipitation, even after five months.         It is to be presumed that
the precipitate formed in the experiment of C. Guyton arose
 from the impurity of the substances employed.              In my opi
 nion, it was owing to the presence of some atoms of sulphuric
 acid contained in the lime.         It is almost always found in
 common lime.
      Exp. II. Bv combining a solution os aluminaled potash
 and filiciated potash, I obtained, as Guyton did, a very thick
 white precipitate, which soon after formed a gelly. This pre
 cipitate, dispersed in water, and filtered, gave, by the tests
 proper for alumine and silex, evident proofs of the affinity of
 these two earths dissolved in potash.
      Exp. III. Lime water, mixed with a solution of filiciated
             gave also proofs of a real affinity between these earths
  Eotash,
    y   the   precipitation, which was instantly effected.         This
  was confirmed also by an analysis of the precipitate.
      Exp. IV. Strontian water with filiciated potash produced
  the same phænomenon as the preceding mixture.
      Exp. V. Strontian water and lime water mixed together
  formed no precipitate, as was observed by Guyton.
       Exp. VI. Strontian water and barytes water, when com
  bined, formed no precipitate.
       Exp. VII. Carbonates of lime and barytes, dissolved in an
  excess of their acid, gave no sign of a new combination.
       Exp. VIII. This experiment, which begins the series of
  those made by Guyton on the solution of earths in acids, did
  not afford me the results announced by that chemist. Having
  made a mixture of equal parts of a solution os muriate of lime
   and a solution of muriate of alumine, he observed, ist, That
   the liquor immediately became turbid, without the acid of
   agitation : ad, That soon after it was opakc, and almost ge
   latinous: 3d, and in the last place, that this precipitate did
   not disappear by the addition of an acid.
       I repeated this experiment, with all the care possible, to
   obtain the same phænomena.            Very pure muriate of lime,
   mixed with muriate of alumine equally pure, gave no sign of
    precipitation : the mixed liquors constantly remained clear.
        It is probable, according to some essays which are pe
    culiar to myself, that the precipitate obtained by C. Guyton
    was occasioned by the sulphuric acid contained in the mu
    riate of alumine, and which at the time of the mixture must
    have re-acted on the lime; for when alumine has been ex-
                   4                                             traded

tracted from alum, it is difficult to free          it. entirely from      sul
phuric acid.
   By extracting alumine from those natural stones which
contain    it,
             either        by
                       the nitric acid or the muriatic acid,                 it
will be easy to discover the error into which the author was
led   bymuriate of lime prepared with the earth of alum.
    Exp. IX. By combining muriate of lime, in solution, with
muriate of barytes, Guyton observed an abundant precipitate,
which was not dissolved bv excess of muriatic acid. The                     so
lutions of these two muriates, whether concentrated, or diluted
with distilled water, gave no sign of precipitation      mixing   by
together, nor      long time after their combination.
                      a                                   In my
opinion, the muriate of lime employed              by
                                              Guyton contained
some atoms of sulphuric acid, which, with the barytes, must
have formed sulphate of barytes.
    Exp. X. Muriate of lime mixed with that of magnesia
gave, as Guyton observed, no sign of precipitation.
   Exp. XI. When solutions of muriates of lime and of stron-
tian were mixed, no change was produced. This was ob
served also      by
                Guyton.
    Exp. XII. Guyton announces, that the mixture of solutions
of muriate of magnesia and muriate of alumine assumed, al
the end of some minutes,        flight milky appearance.
                                    a                       This
experiment, being carefully repeated, exhibited nothing of
the kind: my liquors retained their clearness and trans
parency.                                                                         /
   Exp. XIII. The thirteenth experiment, made with mix                 a
ture of solutions of muriate of magnesia and muriate of ba
rytes, formed no precipitate, either at the moment or long
after; yet Guyton fays he obtained an abundant precipitate.
It    probable thai sulphuric acid was still concealed in the
     is
muriate of magnesia.
    Exp. XIV. This experiment, which was made with mu
riate of magnesia and muriate of strontian, gave no sign of
any new combination.      The fame was remarked         Guyton.  by
    Exp. XV. Muriate of barytes and muriate of alumine,
both dissolved and even diluted in water, gave to Guyton an
abundant precipitate. The fame experiment, repeated with
the solutions concentrated or diluted with water, did not yield
me the fame result the mixture always remained clear, with
                           :
out forming any precipitate.
    Exp. XVI. 'Die sixteenth experiment, made                by
                                                       the com
bination of muriate of strontian with that of barytes, exhi
bited no change.
    Exp. XVI        The seventeenth and last experiment of
                      T.
Guyton, on the affinity of earths in the humid way, was
                                    V   4                  made

  344                On the Analysts and Syntbejis
  made by mixing a solution of muriate of strontian with a so
  lution of muriate of alumine. According to his account, the
  liquor assumed a milky colour, and gave a precipitate which
  the acid did not redifsclve.      This experiment, repeated, like
  all the rest, with a great deal of care, still confirmed the pre
  sence of the sulphuric acid in the solution of muriate of am
  monia he employed ; for I had no precipitate when I repeated
  the experiment, and the liquor, for five months, lost nothing
  of its transparency.
        By admitting between earthy substances an affinity of
   which nature affords a thousand examples, I do not however
   think that the force which attracts them is sufficiently great
   to make them abandon their solvent, without evaporation,
   especially    if it be acid. There is none indeed but silex dis
   solved in alkali that has the property of precipitating the
   other alkaline earths from their aqueous solutions: the other
   earths produce nothing of the kind; for, if alumine dissolved
   in an alkali be mixed with solutions of barytes, strontian,
   lime, &c. no precipitate will be formed ; nothing more will
   take place between the strontian, lime, barytes, &c.
        If the experiments of Guyton had really eitabliflied the
   facts he announces, we should have had no longer any cer
   tain means for analysing earths and stones, ana even' thing
   hitherto done on this subject could only have been considered
    as so many incorrect results.
        I therefore think myself authorized to conclude, from the
    facts announced in this memoir, that the phæno'mena ob
    served by Guyton       were occasioned in many cafes by foreign
v   bodies contained in the matters he employed.
    LVI.     Experiments concerning the Analysis and Synthesis of
        Alkalies gnd Earths, announced by C' .Guyton and
        DksorMes. By C. Daruacq., Pupil of and Ajjijlant
        to C. VAuauELiN, at the School of Mines *.
     T,HE        third volume of the Memoirs of the Institute of
     France contains some experiments by C. Guyton and Des-
     ormes on the composition and decomposition of the two
     fixed alkalies, and ionic of the earths supposed to be simple.
     The importance os such discoveries, the period of their being
     made, and their utility lo the arts, invite all chemists to re
     peat them ; and such were the motives by which I was guided
     in my researches.       To announce that my experiments were
                     • From the Annalcs dc Cbimie, No, 119.
                                                               made

                        tf Alkalies and Earths.                  345
 made in the laboratory of the School of Mines, is to inform
,the public that I was assisted by the advice of C. Vauquelin.
      I must request those chemists whose opinions I am about
 to oppose, to consider my labour as arising only from atlesire
 to discover truth, and not as the result of a vain pretension to
 alter in any manner the esteem which they deserve, and the
 gratitude due to them for their numerous and useful disco
 veries.     I shall therefore content myself with describing the
 manner in which I repeated their experiments.          I shall show
 the results of them, and I sliall leave to chemists to deduce
 from them such conclusions as they may think proper.
      Exp. I. The first experiment, which consists in the re
 duction of a metallic oxide by potash, presents nothing that
  can support the observation of the above authors. The conse
  quence which they themselves deduce from it is merely ac
  cessory.     Besides, it is known that several saline substances
  destitute of potash possess this property.     It' is known also,
  that fire alone is sufficient to reduce the oxide of Jead em
  ployed in this operation.
      Exp. II. Guyton and Desormes decomposed in a platina
  crucible sulphurct of potaih ; and with the help of a strong
  heat they obtained lime.
       I repeated this experiment with common sulphuret of pot
  ash; that is to fay, the substance commonly sold in the shops
  under the name of liver of sulphur; and having exposed it to
  a strong heat, I obtained a residuum which, when treated
  with water, was not entirely dissolved.      The insoluble part,
  treated by nitric acid, was attacked; the nitric solution, tried
  bv the oxalate of ammonia, gave a great quantity of lime.
       Suspecting that the limeTound by this experiment might
  arise from The potash employed        to make the sulphuret, I
  made a second experiment with pure sulphurct of potash,
  prepared from potaih purified by alcohol and sublimated suU
  phur.      I employed 16 grammes of alkali and 8 of sulphur.
    1 he mixture, made in a mortar, and poured by portions into
  a platina crucible strongly heated, left a matter of a reddish
  brown colour, which, treated by water, was almost entirely
  dissolved. The small residuum, which weighed only 4 centi
   grammes, being carefully examined, was found to be filex
  coloured by charcoal ; it arose no doubt from the potash,
  which, as is well known, easily dissolves that earth.
       Exp. III. To perform this third experiment, they took
   oxalate of potash with sulphur. After the mixture was moist
   ened and pulverised, it was treated with heat in a sand-bath,
   and oxalate of lime was obtained.
       As the above authors do not describe this experiment, and
                                                                 give

   346              On the Analyjts and Sjrnthejls
  give no proportions, I shall make known those which I em
  ployed, and the result I obtained.
     To get pure oxalate of potash, I saturated potash purified
 by alcohol with oxalic acid. I took 18 grammes of this salt,
 evaporated almost to dryness, and, having mixed it with 9
 grammes of sublimated sulphur, moistened the mixture with
 naif a decilitre of water. I then placed the capsule contain
 ing it on a sand-bath, and evaporated it at a gentle heat. The
 residuum taken up by distilled water being filtered, there re
 mained on the sifter a blackish yellow residuum, and the li
quor had assumed a flight yellow colour.       The residuum was
 treated with nitric acid ; but notwithstanding the care em
ployed in this operation, no oxalate of lime was found. The
 acid liquor absolutely contained none of it. The sulphur
 which remained was burnt in a platina crucible, and left no
residuum whatever.
    Hoping that this experiment would succeed better with a
stronger heat, the same quantities of oxalate of potash and
sulphur were employed, and the mixture was placed in a
         crucible over a naked fire. Half an hour after, being
Elatina
   rought to a red heat, it was taken off, and the mass obtained
was treated with distilled water, which assumed a dark yel
low colour, and the real smell of an hydrogenated sulphuret.
The liquor was filtered, but no lime was found in the residu
um. This residuum, which weighed only two centigrammes,
was found to be charcoal, furnished in all probability by the
potash employed, which had been purified with alcohol.         I
assured myself that all the oxalate of potash had been decom
posed, and that there had resutted from it a sulphate of
potash.
    Exp. IV. They put oxalate of ammonia into very pure
oxygenated    muriate of potash, and caused it to evaporate at
several times, taking care ,to maintain an excess of nitric
acid to dissolve the oxalate of lime which was formed.        In
this manner a very large quantity was obtained.
    This fourth experiment, which appears to be that which
has hitherto given to the above authors the most lime, by the
decomposition of the hyper-oxygenated muriate of potash,
was made with great care, but always without success.         A»
these authors do not speak of the quantities employed, I shall
give an account of my experiment.
    I took 16 grammes of hyper-oxygenated muriate of
potash, pure and crystallized, and 8 grammes of oxalate of
ammonia, also pure and crystallized, and put them into a
porcelain capsule, with two decilitres and a half of distilled
water. The capsule being placed on a sand-bath, the mix
                                                            ture

                              cs Alkalies and Earths.               347
Utre was evaporated to dryness ; and towards the end of the
evaporation care was taken to add a gramme of nitric acid to
dissolve the oxalate of lime which might be produced.   The
evaporation was repeated four tunes successively, adding wa
ter at each operation, and a gramme of nitric acid.                  The
residuum      was   then  taken  up By   a new   quantity    of  distilled
water, which completely dissolved the whole of the matter.
As there were some atoms disseminated throughout the li
quor, it was filtered, but it was not possible to appreciate the
residuum, as the liquor was verv clear. The nitric acid was
saturated with ammonia, to precipitate the oxalate of lime ;
but in vain was an excess added, for the liquor still remained
clear.
    The fame experiment performed cold did not exhibit more
 successful results, though the mixture remained fifteen days
in contact, as recommended by the authors above mentioned.
     Exp. V. The fifth experiment, which seems to have con
 firmed C. Guyton and Delbrmes in the opinion they had
 formed of the conversion of potassi into lime, is that which
 they performed with hyper-oxygenated muriate of potassi and
 the phosphoric acid. .After treating a mixture of 30 grammes
 of this salt with 10 grammes of acid till reduced to glass,
 they dissolved it in water ; and, having saturated the excess of
 acid by ammonia, filtered the liquor, exposed it to evapora
 tion, and made it again pass to the state of glass. By six dif
 ferent evaporations,       they obtained two or three grammes of
 phosphate of lime, as they believed.
      1ft, The hyper-oxveenated muriate of potassi, decomposed
  by the phosphoric acid", observing the proportions above an
  nounced, produces,             by
                             evaporation to dryness,     vitriform mat
                                                              a
  ter,a   part of which remains insoluble in the water under the
  form of granulated white powder brilliant like salt.
                a
      ad, The liquor separated from the insoluble part being
  again calcined, still leaves         certain quantity of insoluble
                                             a
  powder similar to the former             third calcination produces
                                             ;   a
  the fame effect; and           succession, till the matter is almost
                                  so   in
  entirely converted into this insoluble powder.
      3d,    Ifthe calcination      performed in
                                        is            strong heat, and
                                                          a
  continued       long time, the quantity of the insoluble powder
                    a
 is   more considerable, and fewer calcinations are required to
   convert the matter into this powder.
      It   is
            seen        by
                      the three preceding paragraphs,       that we ob
   tained    a great deal of this fait; it      indeed not difficult to
                                                     is
   procure it. We shall now describe the experiments to which
   we subjected         it,
                       and which evidently proves that this salt          is
   not phosphate of lime.
                                                                     4th,

 34'              On the Analysts and Syntbefit
    4th, This insoluble powder has no favour; it is insoluble
 in cold water, but it is soluble in boiling water in notable
 proportions.
    5th, Though this matter be little soluble in water, lime-
 water however produces in the liquor a very sensible precipi
 tate. Nitrate of silver furnisties one also, which is soluble in
 nitric acid.
    6th, Ammonia occasions no change in the solution of the
 matter in question. As little effect is produced by the fixed
 alkalies.
    7th, The oxalate of ammonia made no alteration in the
 above liquor, which it would certainly have done, had there
 been a suitable quantity of lime,
    8th, This salt is exceedingly fusible.   By the blow-pipe it
 fuses into a pearl, transparent while in a state of fusion, but
 which on cooling becomes opake.
    9th, This powder is fallible in the nitric, muriatic, and
 even phosphoric acids.      These solutions are thick, viscous,
 and tenacious, like clear starch.     When these solutions are
 sufficiently diluted with water, they give no precipitates by
alkalies ; but, if concentrated, tbey give one, which redissolves
in a large quantity of water.
    From all these experiments we are authorized to conclude
the citizens Guyton and Desormes took an alkaline phosphate
for phosphate of lime. This phosphate, which is scarcely so
luble, as above seen, is not a simple phosphate; for it is
known that the alkaline phosphates are very soluble, especially
that of potash ; but it was not before known that in the ex
periment of which we have given an account there is formed
a new phosphate,      which ought to be distinguished by the
name of neutral phosphate. The following experiment serves
also to confirm this reasoning, and confirms in an irrevoca
ble manner all those described,
    [ mixed a certain quantity of phosphate of potash with
pure potash, placed the mixture in a platina crucible, and
exposed it to a strong heat. I obtained for result a white sub
stance, almost insoluble, which possessed all the properties of
the salt obtained in the last experiment, and which was again
ascertained to be a real phosphate of potash with an excels of
base.    This kind of synthesis still proves that the phosphate
of lime described by the above authors is only this new salt,
which, on account of its apparent properties and insolubility,
has been top little examined.
   Exp. VI. By treating hyper-oxygenated muriate of soda
in the fame manner as that of potash, these authors announce
                                                            that

 the whole mass became liquid.         After cooling there was
 sound a vitreous matter, brittle, slightly deliquescent, and
 wholly soluble in water.    When the liquor lud become very
clear, an attempt was made to precipitate froia it the mag
 nesia, by the help of potash ; but having obtained not a single
atom of precipitate, the experiment was repeated several times,
but always without success. From what has been said, it is
evident that the magnesia obtained by the above authors can
not have arisen but from the soda which they employed ; for
it is known that soda is very often accompanied with mag
nesia.    In this experiment, as in the fifth, the platina is
strongly attacked. In two trials I had a residuum of eight
centigrammes of this metal.
   Exp.   VII.  Nitrate of  soda treated by the phosphoric acid
gave to the above authors magnesia.       I repeated this experi
ment four times without obtaining the fame result. I varied,
but in vain, the doses of the salt and the acid, as well as the
mode of operation ; but by employing as much as 20
grammes at a time of nitrate of soda, ana 10 of acid, I ob
tained only a blackish residuum weighing four centigrammes,
which was sound to be silex coloured by charcoal.          Thole
who recollect: the existence of this earth in the phosphoric
acid discovered by C. Vauquelin, will be able to account for
the silex found in this experiment.
   I must inform those who may wish to repeat this experi
ment, that they mult not employ phosphorous acid for phos
phoric acid ; for when the former is employed, and poured
over the red and fused nitrate, a very strong deflagration is
produced, the matter is thrown frem the crucible, and speed
ily burns every thing that it meets with. This observation
ought to be recollected in regard to the Experiments 5 and 6.
   Exp.   VIIL   In this eighth  experiment, when potash was
heated   with charcoal,   and when the capsule containing the
                                                         mixture

35°               On tie Analysts and Synthesis
mixture was brought to a red heat, they obtained, for re
siduum, carbonate of potasli, lime, magnesia, and even some
alumine.
    Without describing all the fruitless trials made to find the
three earths producedin this experiment, I shall relate some
of them, which prove that these pretended conversions arise
only from the impurity of the charcoal employed.
    Having made choice of light charcoal from white wood, it
was pulverized and strongly calcined.        Sixteen grammes of
pure potash     and  eight grammes    of  this  calcined charcoal
were then exactly mixed, by moistening it with a little wa
ter; after which it was put into a platina capsule, and
brought to a red heat. The residuum, after being edulco
rated with water, to separate from it all the potash, was
treated with nitric acid. The solution, when filtered, gave by
evaporation a glutinous matter, found to be lilex.        The ni
trates separatea from this silex gave lime and magnesia.
    Presuming that the charcoal might be the cause of the
presence of the lime and magnesia found in this experiment,
I  thought it my duty to assure myself of it by analysing that
employed.
    I burnt ai6 parts of the fame charcoal to reduce it to
ashes, taking care to employ a platina crucibk ; the ashes
obtained weighed only 91 parts. This residuum was treated
with the nitric acid. By proper evaporations, the presence of a
       deal of carbonate and sulphate of lime was ascertained,
  'he products obtained separately by the common processes
freat
gave (ilex 41, magnesia 16, lime ia, alumine 3.
    For the fake of greater precision, and to be more fully con
vinced in regard to the existence of lime in the charcoal, as
well as to prove that the lime sound by C. Desormes arose
only from the charcoal employed, I made the following ex
periment :
    I took four grammes of pure charcoal obtained from the
decomposition of the carbonic acid by phosphorus, and, hav
ing mixed it with 18 grammes of pure potasli, put it into a
platina capsule, and brought it to a red heat, having pre
viously taken care to moisten it. The matter which thence
resulted being treated with water, there remained a black re
siduum, which was treated with nitric acid, and the solution
diluted with water was filtered. This nitric solution was
mixed with oxalate of ammonia; but this fait produced no
alteration in the above liquor, even when the excess of acid
was saturated by ammonia ; which it could not have failed to
do had there been ever so little lime, or even magnesia and
alumine.     This would be the place for calling the reader's
                                                         attention

added, a great deal of sulphurated hydrogen gas is produced ;
and by saturating the potash a large quantity of sulphur is
precipitated. This again explains the state in which the lime
is found, and perhaps the magnesia, in the charcoal ; for there
is no need to fay that the sulphur obtained in this operation
must arise from the sulphuric acid decomposed.        There is no
doubt that the sulphates of lime and magnesia contributed to
this circumstance, since the quantities or these earths in the
charcoal were considerable.      This still serves to explain the
observation made by C. Desormes, who several times found
lime, magnesia, and alumine in the fame residuum.          By re
collecting that these three earths exist in charcoal, it will be
 readily seen whence they arose.
     Exp. IX. By treating soda with charcoal in the same man
 ner as the potash was treated, the above authors obtained
 magnesia, alumine, and lime.        It is here seen that this re
 sult is the fame as ought to be given by common charcoai.         I
 shall therefore say nothing further respecting this experiment,
 than merely to announce that in treating pure soda with
 pure charcoal (that in particular arising from the decompo
 sition of the carbonic acid), none of the above earths are ob
 tained.
     Exp. X. Muriate of potash      treated by charcoal gave to
 Desormes lime.      It is needless to observe, in this tenth ex
 periment, that the litno arose from the charcoal; since, when
 pure matters are employed, none of that substance is found.
     Exp. XI. The eleventh experiment, which, besides lime,
 gave magnesia and alumine, will not give any of these earths
 when pure charcoal is employed. This experiment was made
 with muriate of soda and charcoal.                              ,
     Exp.  XII.  The twelfth experiment, which       ga\'e exactly
 the fame results as the eleventh, was made by treating mu

   riate of soda with sulphur. As charcoal had not been hera
   employed, I took great care to repeat this experiment several
   times ; but always without success.          I cannot presume to
   say   what  may  have   been   the cause  of the result obtained by
  the above authors : it can be ascribed only to the matters
  they employed, since, with pure muriate or soda and subli
  mated sulphur, I could discover, in the two experiments               I
 'made, no traces either of lime, magnesia, or alumine.
       Exp. XIII. As the thirteenth experiment is of no use in
  regard to the theory of Guyton and Desormes, it is needless
  to give any account of it.
       Exp. XIV. By mixing sulphate of soda with lime, these
  authors thought thev perceived a disengagement of ammonia :
  I   also thought I observed the same disengagement         in the va
  pours produced     by  the  muriatic  acid when   Drought into con
  tact; with the mixture.       Lime alone, though extracted from
  marble, gave by the fame acid, when moistened, white va
  pours.     1 am not convinced that this disengagement,        sensible
  only    on the approach    of  the  muriatic  acid, arose  from  am
  monia ; for, though I employed a large mass of matter, I
  never could distinguish that alkali by the smell. The vapours
  occasioned by the muriatic acid were perhaps owing only to
  the heat produced at the time of the mixtures, and also to
 the great affinity which the acid employed has for water.
 How, indeed, can we explain the formation of this substance
 by the combination of lime with pure water? or how can
 we conceive, if it is not formed, that it can co-exist with
 lime, which, as is well known, possesses the property of ex
 pelling ammonia wherever it is found ?
      Exp. XV. In the fifteenth experiment, these authors
 thought also that they remarked a disengagement               of am
 monia, by combining intimately together lime, sulphur, and
 water.
      Exp. XVI. The sixteenth experiment makes mention of
 an analogous trial as simple as the preceding.            In my opi
 nion, the explanation of these experiments will be sufficiently
developed in the eighteenth experiment, since it is that which,
 according to these authors, gave a great deal of ammonia.
      Exp. XVIl. By this experiment the above authors, instead
 of decomposing the lime, attempted to compose it. Th» pro
cesses which they employed for this purpose were as follow :
      They formed nitrate of alumine, which they decomposed,
 at several times, by heat : by this simple means they obtained
lime.
    '
      Nitrate of magnesia was employed with the fame success.
      After having carefully prepared the two nitrates, which
                                                                  they

a natural stone at the time  of my experiments on the affinity
of earths. The acid employed was also very pure.
   The nitrate of magnesia, notwithstanding all my care, did
not give a more satisfactory result : the lime found by Des-
ormes was, no doubt, accidental.
    E\p. XVIII. This experiment, which calls to mind the
 14th, 15th, and 16th, on account of the fame phænomenon
by which they are connected, is that which increased the
opinion of the above authors on the recompofition of simple
earths.' Having instantaneously made fulphuret of potasli,
and added oxalic acid, they obtained, as they announce, a
sensible disengagement of ammonia instead of sulphurated
hydrogen, and the residuum was magnesia.
   After making two trials in      a porcelain mortar  without
discovering ammonia, but a     product extremely fetid, which
I  suspected might conceal the alkali I sought for, to assure
myself of it I made the following experiments:
   1st, I mixed 30 grammes of pure potasli with 15 grammes
of sublimated sulphur, and the mixture exactly made was put
into a tubulated retort with two decilitres of water.   To the
beak of the retort I adapted a bent tube, which was immersed
in a solution os sulphate of iron at its maximum of oxidation.
By the disposition of my experiment it is seen that I must
have perceived the smallest portion of ammonia ; for it is
known, that if the sulphurated hydrogen does not precipitate
the sulphate of iron green, an atom of this gas combined
with ammonia will immediately manifest itself. My appa
ratus being thus arranged, I poured into the retort fix gram
mes of pure and crystallized oxalic acid. A strong disen
gagement of sulphurated hydrogen was immediately pro
duced ; the flask containing the sulphate of iron was agi
tated a long time by this gaseous fluid ; but when the opera •

tion was finished there was not a single atom of precipitate
produced in the liquor.     This experiment, which I think
one of the mod exact for ascertaining the ammonia that
might have existed or been produced in this operation, evi
dently proves, that if the above authors obtained any, this
alkali must have arisen from some other cause than that of a
decomposition of the substances employed, if they were pure.
   The residuum examined in three operations gave no mag
nesia.  I must here observe that I employed sulphur, which
I sublimated myself.
   To remove all doubt respecting this experiment, and to be
more certain of my results, I made a second, but still without
success.
    The apparatus being arranged as in the preceding experi
ment, I put in the place ot the sulphate of iron muriatic
acid, and began my operation.         After all disengagement had
ceased, I took the muriatic acid, which I evaporated at a
gentle heat ; but, not being able to obtain an atom of saline
residuum, I poured lime into the small quantity of liquor
which remained.         I added more than was necessary, but
notwithstanding all my precautions I had no disengagement
of ammonia.       It is now seen, bv these two experiments, that
no disengagement       of ammonia is produced ; for, I must re-
      it, muriate of ammonia would have been formed in the
  aft, and in the first iron would have been precipitated
Iicat                                                            :no
thing  is disengaged but sulphurated hydrogen gas in very large
quantity, and the residuum contains no magnesia.
    Exp. XIX. This last experiment the above authors made
by taking the charcoal of sugar, which they mixed with lime
extracted from marble         :this mixture being exposed to a
strong heat
                in  pktina crucible well stopped, they obtained
                     a
alumine and magnesia.
    As they do not give the proportions of the matters em
ployed in this experiment, nor the quantities of the products
 obtained,   I presume that they considered          only as
                                                        it       new

 proof  in favour  of the theory they have established.
  I    repeated this experiment, and employed             charcoal of
 sugar  and  pure charcoal.     With   the charcoal   produced from
 40 grammes of crystallized sugar,       obtained
                                                I     little alumine:

 the product collected weighed only fix centigrammes             ;per
 haps it  contained magnesia.      In my second operation, when
I   employed pure charcoal,        had not

    If the experiments I have described in the course of this
memoir are exact, and if I have properly observed the phæ-
nomena they exhibited, the result will be, that the facts an
nounced by C. Guyton and Desormes, though for the most
part true, cannot lead to the conclusions which they have
deduced from them, on account of the nature of the sub
stances which they employed : we must therefore conclude,
till otherwise shown, that the alkalies and earths must be
retained in the class of simple or indecom posed bodies; that
the experiments of these chemists du not prove that potash
is formed of lime and hydrogen ; that magnesia and azote
produce lime; that azoted alumine constitutes magnesia;
and, in the last place, that magnesia and hydrogen give birth
to soda.    I do not, however, pretend that these iubstances
are simple, but only that the facts adduced as a proof are not
proper to prove it.

                                                       Dec. 14, 1799.
         FEW     weeks   after    my arrival in South America, I
 transmitted to Delambre          an extract from my astronomical
 observations,   because I hoped that some of them might be
 interesting to the Board of Longitude : as I have, however,
 learned that the brig by which I lent my letters was wrecked
 near Guadaloupe during the storm which lately prevailed in
 these regions, 1 think it necessary to transmit to you a copy
 of them.
     After a passage of about fix weeks, in the frigate Pizarro,
 I  arrived at the coast of Paria.      My plan was to proceed first
 to the Havannah, and thence to Mexico ; but 1 could not
 withstand the strong desire I had of feeing the wonders of the
 Oronoko. and the lofty Cordilleras, which extend from the
 high land of Quito to the rivers of Guarapeche and Arco.
 As I have now returned from a very interesting journey to
 the interior of Paria, through the Cordilleras ot Cocolar, Tu-
  meri, and Guiri, and to the settlement thereof the Capuchins,
  never before visited bv any naturalist, during which I carried
 with me, on three mules, my astronomical instruments, viz.
 a quadrant by Bird, and sextants, telescopes, and microme
  ters, by Ramsden and Troughton, you will perhaps expect
  that I have done a great deal for astronomy ; but you know
  that this science is too remote from my principal objects-
  philosophy in general, geology, eudiometry, and the physi-

it is impossible to labour so incessantly as under 490. I chose
rather to make a few observations with accuracy, than a great
many imperfect ones ; and to insert them with great minute
ness in my journals, that, in case I mould die in the course
of my travels, no doubt might remain in regard to their
exactness.
   In the two papers which I transmitted to Dclambre, you
will find my observations made in Europe with Borda's new
inclinatorium.    I found by     that local circumstances have     it,
a greater  influence on the inclination of the magnetic needle
than on its declination       and that no connection seems to
                                                     ;
exist between the situation of the place of observation and the
inclination. This find confirmed in the new world in the
                                     I
interior of New Andalusia, and therefore the observations
made        by
           Nonet in Egypt seem to be established.       The de
clination, however,     affected     local causes, but much less
                                           is                             by                                             :
at sea they are much more regular, and the variations arc-
much more uniform.
 I    have here given you my observations      of the inclination
only, which are true to 15'.     During calms obtained them                                 I

considered as correct.     Though calms are not uncommon
between the tropics, during the course of forty days           was                                                I

   In the year 1776, according to Cavallo, the inclination of
the needle in the undcrnieniionod latitudes and longitudes
was as follows :

   Since Coulomb and Cafsini no longer employ themselves
with observing the declination, I know no place in the earth
where the declination has been determined with certainty to
10", and not ten where it has been determined to i'. What
uncertainty still prevails respecting the real declination of the
needle at Paris !        The ten observations which I made at sea,
will serve hereafter to determine whether the inclination
speedily changes.          The longitude and latitude of the places
of observation were always accurately determined at the time
by means of a Kamsden's sextant, divided from 15 to 15 se
conds; and a Bcrthoud's chronometer.                         You will fee by
them that the inclination decreases very rapidly from the
latitude of 370, and that it increases less towards the east
than to the west from the latitude of 37° to 48^.
    It appears to me, that in the higher chain of the calca
reous mountains of this province, not far from the equator,
small elevations above the level of the sea derange the in
clination much more strongly than the higher mountains in
the Pyrenees and Old Castile.                   As a proof, I (hall here
give  observations      made    at  four   places    which lie pretty nearly

   Borda is of opinion, as appears by the memorandum drawn
up for the men of science who accompanied La Perouse, that
the intensity of the magnetic power is the fame all over the
earth ; as he ascribes tnc small variation which he found in
it at Cadiz, Tcnerifs, and Brest, to the imperfection of the
compass.       He requested me to verify this circumstance. You

  here see that the magnetic power is so different, that between
  Paris and Cumana it decreased from 245 to 229 vibrations in
  ten minutes, though it does not decrease with the inclina
  tion.    This decrease cannot certainly be ascribed to any
  change in the goodness of the needle, or lo other accidental
  causes : for the fame needle made in the fame time at Paris
                        Girona, 232; at Barcelona, 245; at Va
  345 vibrations; at
  lentia, 235 ; and, after a journey of several months, gave at
  the fame places exactly the fame number of vibrations as
  before my departure.       These are always the fame, in the
  open fields, in the house, or in a cavern, so that the mag
  netic power in any place is always the fame, and remains a
  long time without change ; and seems to be a general power,
 like that of gravity.
     I had the mortification of not being able at sea to make
  any good observations of the declination.        Notwithstanding
  all the trouble 1 took, I could not find an azimuth compass
  on which I could depend within 40'. This is the true reason
 why I have made no mention to you of the declination at
 sea.    The point, however, where the inclination vanishes,
  certainly lies further to the west than marked in Lambert's
 chart, in the Berlin astronomical almanac for 1779. A good
 observation, made in the year 1775 aboard an English '"ship
 from Liverpool, places this vanishing point in latitude 290
 north, long. 66° 40' west.       I observed, with great care, the
 declination   at  two  places  on    the coast of America with a
 compass by    Lenoir,   in which    the  needle is suspended by a
 thread, according to the. method of Prony and Von Zach.
 At noon, October 1799, it was at Cumana, and twenty
 leagues further east, 40 13' 45" east: at Caripe, the chief
 plai;e of the Capuchin million among the Chaimas and
 Caribs, 30 i."/ east.
     During the earthquake at Cumana, on the 4th of No
 vember 1799, the inclination of the magnetic needle was
 altered, but not the declination.         The former, before the
 shock, was 44 'SO of the new division; after the sliock it
 remained at 43' -35.      The number of the vibrations of the
 dipping   needle,  however,   was the fame as before, viz.
                                                             229 in
 ten minutes. This, united to other observations, seems in mv
 opinion to prove, that during the earthquake this small part
of the ball of the earth was changed, and not the needle;
 for, in districts where no signs of an earthquake ever appeared
in the primitive chain of accumulated masses of granite, the
inclination was as    great after as before.
     On account of    the interest which you take    in every thing

 that relates to navigation, the following        observations    will not
  be unacceptable.
     I have carefully    proved    what Dr. Franklin and Captain
 Jonathan Williams      assert  in the Transactions of the American
 Society* respecting the use of the thermometer for disco
 vering shallows at lea; and am able to confirm, in the fulled
 manner, what they have said.           I was altonislied to fee how
 the water became evidently colder as its depth decreased, and
 how the neighbourhood os shallows, and of the coasts, could
thereby be announced.            The worst spirit of wine thermo
meter, if only sensible, will therefore, in the hands of the
 most ignorant mariner, be a very useful instrument in the
night-time, and during storms, or when it is difficult or
impossible to heave the lead.          This observation I cannot too
strongly recommend to the attention of the Board of Longi
tude. Our whole crew were asionistied to see how speedily
the thermometer fell, when we approached                the large bank
 which extends from Tobago to Grenada, and east from Mar
garita. These observations may be made with more ease, as
 the water of the sea, in an extent of 12000 square miles, has
 always the fame temperature day and night ; so that the most
sensible thermometer, during from four to (ix days fail, does
 not rife or fall above o^".          In the neighbourhood of shal
 lows it was from 2 to 3 degrees, and more, colder. This
 observation of Franklin, hitherto forgotten, may at some
 period be of great use to navigation; not that seamen fliould
throw aside the lead entirely, and trust to the thermometer,
 for this would be folly; but because the observations may he
so easily repealed,     and because the thermometer will an
 nounce the danger much sooner than the lead, as the colder
 water above the (hallows lessens the temperature in the water
In the neighbourhood., I can assert that this new mean is
not more uncertain than the log, and the helps already cm-
ployed in navigation.        If the thermometer does not fall, na
vigators ought not to depend that they are entirely secure
from shallows; but if it falls, they must be on their guard.
This warning is certainly more valuable than our sea charts,
where the mallows are in general laid down in a very in
correct manner; and to immerse a thermometer in a bucket
filled with sea water is certainly much easier.                I have also
measured     several times the specific gravity and temperature of
 the  sea water, at the surface and at certain depths, by means
of Dollond's balance and thermometers, which are placed in
cafes furnished with a valve.        As mv instruments were com
 pared with the best Parisian ones, and as 1 could be more

chart in which I intend to make known the result of these
experiments will be interesting.                 In the latitude of 17° and

West Indies, where, without an extraordinary current pre
vailing, the water is denser than under a less latitude. The

    This letter   was written at Cumana, but for want of a
          opportunity 1 was obliged to bring it with me to this
firoper
  arge capital of the province of Caraccas, which is situated
in a fertile valley abounding with cacao, cotton, and coffee,
 2400 feet above ,ihe level of the sea, and in a climate per
fectly similar to that of Europe.                  The thermometer in the
night-time falls       to  1 1°,  and in the day never rises above 17*
or 18".
    The cloudy    weather,        which here daily follows the fun's
passage over     the     meridian, makes the observation of corre
sponding altitudes very difficult and uncertain, as the after
noon observation is often lost.              The cloudy weather after the
earthquake of Cumana deprived me of an opportunity of ob
serving the immersions of the second satellite of Jupiter on
 the 2(1 and 9th of November. I shall here give you the prin
                                                                          cipal

  cording to C. Richard,    this daily variation amounts     at Su
  rinam to two lines.
     These observations are the more interesting, as all the charts
  of this part of the world are very incorrect ; and the agree
  ment of my longitude of TenerifF and Tobago, with the ob
  servations of Borda and Chabert, within from 2" to 5" of
  time, is a proof of the excellence of my chronometers.
     The serenity of the nights between the tropics gave me an
  opportunity of comparing with each other the strength of the
  light of the austral stars ; which in some of them, such as
  the Crane, Altar, Toucan, and the Foot of the Centaur, seems
  to have changed since the time of La Caille.         I employed
  the method proposed by Dr. Herschel, and diaphragms of
  the fame kind as those used for the satellites.   If the light of
 iSirius be supposed equal to 100 parts, and that of Procyon 88,

Nc        O  philosophical instruments are so varied         their con                in
 struction as barometers, and especially the portable ones. But
if   the latter leave no room for improvement             regard to ex           in
 actness, they are exceedingly complex, and liable to be de
 ranged;         that travellers are often obliged to renounce the
                 so
 observations     they depended on making during the course of,
their journeys.
     It   is very rare that the best barometers are not either de
ranged or broken in the course of              long journey. Nothing

            with the cup uppermost. Naturalists who travel stood
in need of this simple instrument, the only barometer really
portable being that of Deluc, the construction of which                                             is
more difficult; and which,                           in

avoid.
 I     sliall fay nothing of      great number of other barometers
                                            a
more or less complex, as well as defective, and             general in

convenient for transportation. They all have faints, which
it  would be too tedious to enumerate.            It has been proposed
to use for this purpose iron tubes with glass lubes cemented ¦
to them; hut          has not been remarked that the mercury at
                            it
length     oxidates,   loses its brilliancy, and adheres partially to
the tube.
    My barometer, the simplest possible, will be attended with
this advantage, that           can be procured at
                                       it               moderate price.      a

suffering it to escape when it does not dilate. Ivory stop-cocks
are attended with the fame advantage.             E is a cylindric cup,
the diameter of which must be            known;     about an inch ap
peals   to  me  to be the most convenient       dimension     for a baro
meter of this kind.
   F is a piece of stiamoy leather with which the cup is co
vered.     It permits the air to exercise an action on the mer
cury,    and   prevents it from escaping when the instrument is
carried.
    After having boiled the mercury7 in the tube, the cock and
cup must be cemented at the interior bending. A little mer
cury is then to be added, that it may float above the stop-
cock, when it is (hut after the instrument has been inclined.
    It may readily be conceived that the interior diameter of
the long tube, and that of the cup, being known, the greatest
precision may be obtained when they are perfedtly cylindric ;
for, the diameter of the two cylinders being known, the ratio
of their solidity may be known *.
    Those who wish to avoid the trouble of this short calcula
tion may cement to the stop-cock a very large cup; and
then the error occasioned by the elevation of the level of the
mercury will be a very small fraction of a line, even if the
 barometer should descend several inches.
    In cafe it may not be thought proper to adapt to the stop-
cock a large cup, which would render the barometer much
heavier, nothing will be necessary but to measure the height
cf the mercury above the line os the level, and to subtract it
from that of the mercury in the long tube. Let us suppose,,
for example, that the barometer marks 23 in. 6 lin. and that
the mercury in the tube is elevated only ^ne line; the re
mainder will be 23 in. 5 lin. for the height of the mercury.
    By taking a view of the height of the barometer, without
making the least calculation, it will be easy to devise how the
scale may be graduated so as to make this correction needless.
    A nonius, lo indicate the ,\ih or even TJjth of a line may
be adapted to this instrument ; but the variations in the up
per strata of the atmosphere are too well known to admit of
our having recourse to so exact a graduation in the measuring
of heights. Ought we not to consider as very correct a baro
meter that indicates ,'0th of a line ? The errors in the meafure-
   • Let us
             suppose that the diameter of the barometric tube is two lines,
and that of the cup twelve, the ascension of the mercury in the cup will be
to the depression of that in the tube as the square of the surfaces; vhicn
in this cafe is as 4 to 144, or 1 to 36.   When the barometer indicates
i;  inches, we must then subtract from that height i-36th, that is 10 lay, a
Lint, and we shall have the real height, 24 inches 11 lines.

 merit of great heights arise rather from the unequal densities
of   the strata of the atmosphere, and the attraction of the mer
 cury in the tube, than from defects in the subdivision. A ba
 rometer will always be pretty good, if the mercury it contains
 is well purified and dry; and if it has been boiled in the
 tube ; if the tube is at least ^ths of a line in diameter ;                  -

it   is much simpler in the construction, and less expensive.

tions with portable and comparative instruments, and with
which the level of the whole surface of France might be taken
without any sensible error, and without having recourse to
long and tedious operations. The society of Manheim sent
meteorological instruments to various distant observers; but
the construction of them rendered this excellent plan fruit
 less ; as the barometers, when they arrived, were all broken
 or deranged.
     Would it not be of advantage to science, if the French go
 vernment would send to all the schools, learned societies, and
other establishments,      barometers, by means of which com
 parative    meteorological tables might be constructed ; by
  which the height of the mountains and different positions
 might be ascertained, and valuable observations made, which
 have been omitted in most topographical surveys, or have
  been made soliadly, in consequence of the inaccuracy of the
  barometers, that no dependance can be placed on them ?
     The advancement of philosophy and natural history is the
 object I proposed in publistiing these reflections. Compara
 tive observations might render the study of meteorology less
 dry and more agreeable. The want of correct observations is
  the cause of our being as yet so little acquainted with the
  extent of the variations in the atmosphere, the point of their
  maximum or minimum, £cc. &c. There is reason to think
  that such data would increase the probability of meteorologi
  cal prognostication, and render more interesting a branch of
  natural philosophy yet little known.         The corresponding
  heights of mountains and plains might be of great service to
  the geologist,  and enable him to resolve the molt curious
  problems.
     P. S. I have learnt, from C. Dolomieu, that professor Pic-
  tet employed    a barometer     nearlv similar to that here de
  scribed. But as I am unacquainted with that instrument, and
  have used mine in journeys for four years without its being
  deranged, 1 publish this description of it with confidence,
  being persuaded that it may be of use to philosophers and na
  turalists.

     tboryncbus Paradoxus.           By   J. F. Blumekbach, Pro
    fessor of   Medicine     at  Gdttingen, and Member of the Me
     dical Society of Paris *.
        HE specimen of this animal in my possession is about
  19  inches   in length; the head is 4 inches ; the tail nearly
  the fame; and the neck and trunk 10 inches f.
     It is covered with two kinds of hair. The interior gray,
  short, and very soft, like down; that on the outside, mixed
 with others longer and differ, brownish on the back, and yel
 lowish on the belly.
     The limbs are short. The fore feet are about 2 J- inches
 in length; the hind feet are somewhat longer. The feet
 have five toes, palmated (natatorii).               The natatory mem
 branes of the fore feet are very broad, not inserted between
 the toes, but attached below them, so as to be better calcu
 lated for diving.
     The tail flat, and covered with stiff hair like bristles.
     But what appears most singular and anomalous is the con
 formation of the head, being furnislied with a broad beak
 resembling that of a duck.           The mandibles, spatula- formed,
 are flat.    The upper one, about 2 inches in length, and
 i|d in breadth.
     These mandibles are covered with a coriaceous membrane,
 which extends to the corners of their aperture.
    The under mandible, which is narrower than the upper,
is serrated (a, fig. 1. Plate IX.) on the edges, as is the cafe in
 a duck's bill.     The palate is furrowed across.
     My specimen is destitute of teeth, like that described by
Dr. Shaw ; but I have lately been informed, in a letter from
 Sir Joseph Banks, that in another specimen two small denies
molares have been found on each fide of each mandible.
     The whole beak at the root is edged with an undulated
membranaceous border running across it (b).

    \  Dr. Bobba, a very respectable physician now resident at Gottingen,
 had before sent us a very interesting note on the, ornitborjncbus paradoxhi,
in which he fays that there are three specimens in Great Britain similar to
that in the posse-diem of professor Blumenbach ; viz. one in the British
Museeum j one in the posscliion of Mr. Dobson.an amateur of natural his'
tory at London; and a third in the university of Edinburgh.           But the
information he sent us hiving been already published in the Bulletin da
Sciences, we did not think it necessary to insert it in this work. We have
confined ourselves therefore to these new observations of professor Blumen
bach. — Note of the French Editor.
                                                                        The

    The conformation          of the. cranium, taken from the occi
pital condyli       {ed),   and    the intermaxillary bones (ef), has,
on the first view, a great resemblance to that of the duck.
The bones of the skull are divided by no sutures ; but the in
terior chamber of the brain is divided by an osseous hook (g)
Cunning lengthwise, which is found in no other quadruped *,
and similar to that of the tetrao urogallus.
     What seems to be highly worthy of notice, however, is
the remarkable apparatus of the nerves of the second branch
of the fifth pair, and the distribution of it in three regions of
the coriaceous membrane which surrounds the beak.                            The
nerve (b) which proceeds from the lower orbital foramen
goes to the transverse edge : the other (i), which issues be
 hind the intermaxillary bones, is distributed on the labial
edges: the third (i), which issues from the synchondrosis,
 that divides the anterior hooked legs of the intermaxillary
 bones, proceeds to the integument of the beak.
      Comparing this large apparatus of maxillary nerves, with
 which nature has provided this coriaceous integument, and
 the like structure of the duck's bill, there can scarcely be a
 doubt that this highly sensible membrane, which surrounds
 the beak, serves, in a very particular manner, in the ornitbo-
 rynebus, as in aquatic birds, for the purposes of feeling, by
 means of which these animals can search for their food in
 muddy places, where neither fight nor smell can be of any
  use to them in that respect.             Hence the eyes of the omilbo-
  rynebus are very small, but the nostrils (Im) exceedingly
  broad.
      This wonderful animal, therefore, affords an exception to
  the order of the internal fenses assigned to quadrupeds by
  Bussonf, who fays : •' In quadrupeds, smell is the first of
  fenses ; taste is the second ; or rather, these two form only
  one : fight is the third j, hearing the fourth ; and feeling the

    -LX OW that           we are acquainted with the faults in the con
    struction of the distilling    apparatus, let us try to make an ap
    plication of it in order       to improve the knowledge we have
    acquired in regard to distillation, and the art of managing
    the fire.
       It appears to me that the whole art of distilling may be
    reduced to the three following principles :
       1st, To heat at once, and in an uniform manner, all the
    points of the mass of the liquid.
       2d, To remove all those obstacles which may confine the
    ascent of the vapours.
      3d, To effect the condensation as speedily as possible.
      To fu'sil the first condition, it will be necessary that the
    mass of the liquid should have little depth ; and this requires
    that the bottom of the boiler should present a very large sur
    face,    that the fire may be applied in a great many points.
      The bottom of the still ought to be a little bent inwards.
    This form is attended with two advantages : the first   that                          is,
     by these means the fuel     at an equal distance from every
                                     is
    point of        it,
                  and that the heat      uniform throughout
                                                        is   the                              ;
    second     that
              is,      this construction the bottom 01 the boiler
                          by
.   has more strength, and the matters which may be deposited at
    the bottom of the liquor are thrown to the angles which rest
    on the mason work, and where, consequently,        less dan
                                                                               it
                                                                               is
    gerous.   When this deposit falls upon parts immediately
    exposed  to the direct action of the heat,      forms   crust,        it              a
    which prevents the liquor from being in contact with the
    part of the boiler covered                    it,
                                    and the sire then burns the
                                             by
    metal. This inconvenience     not to be feared,
                                              is       the deposit             if
     by   the curved form of the bottom      thrown into the angles,
                                                             is
    where    it  withdrawn from the direct action of the heat.
                  is
       The fire must be made to circulate around the boiler                                       by
    means of spiral chimney; in which case none of the heat
                  a
    will be lost, as the whole liquid     surroundedis      and ex             by   it,
    posed to its action in an uniform manner.
       That the column of steam which rises may experience no
    obstacle in its ascent, the sides of the boiler ought to rife in
a     perpendicular direction     and the steam must be maintained
                                     ;
    at the fame degree         of expansion till         it       has reached the refrige
    ratory.   But the steam rising freely, and being condensed dy
    coming into contact with the cool sides of the capital, would
    fall back into the boiler or body of the still,  the sides were       if
                  6                                             not

becomes very wide; it is consequently necessary to give it
a considerable height, that its sides may have the inclination
of 75 degrees. This construction is attended with two great
inconveniences : the first       that  is,
                                        renders the capital heavy,
                                              it
clumsy, and expensive; the second, that         makes  it  difficult it
to give to the upper edges of the boiler that strength necessary
to withstand the effort of the capital.      These considerations
induced me to make some changes in the above construction.
These changes all relate to the form of the boiler            make   :I
the sides to project    little as they rife, and then bring them
                          a
nearer to each other towards the top, in such         manner th^ta
the diameter of the aperture may correspond to that of the
bottom. This form removes the two effects above mentioned,
and has the advantage of presenting       border at the upper part,
                                                   a
against which the bubbles arising from too strong an ebullition
may be broken, and thrown back to the centre of the boiler.
    Besides this change in the form of the boiler,       thought I                 it
proper to take away the refrigeratory with which the capital
was covered, and which was attended with the inconvenience
of cooling the steam, and forming: cloud of vapour in the
                                                   a
inside, which opposes its further ascension.
  It  may be observed, that in distilling       means of
                                                       by     retort      a
in   asand-bath,'    will be sufficient to apply
                     it                               cool body to
                                                                 a

                                             :
 formed on the sides, and the liquor stills to the bottom of the
retort.
                     '
     If  at first proposed to preserve the refrigeratory,
         I                                                     was            it
because    ascribed to
             I                part of the effects which depended
                              it   a
on   aproper construction of the furnace.          however, after
                                                            I,

pressing the refrigeratory.       Besides, this change was more
economical, and occasioned less embarrassment.
  After this conceived that the great art of condensing the
                 I
vapours was confined to enlarging the beak of the capital,

  and carefully cooling the worm.        By these means the va
  pours escape from the still with greater facility, as they are
  admitted into the worm by the speedy condensation of those
  which preceded them.
      These different improvements began to be introduced into
  Languedoc about fifteen years ago.         The brothers Argand
 .greatly contributed to make them be adopted.             They first
  elabbfhed (tills according to these principles, and found them
  attended with so much saving, in regard to time and fuel,
  that from the results of comparative experiments it has been
  estimated at four-fifths.
       I have myself superintended several establishments of this
  kind, where the fame principles were adopted.         In my opi
  nion, it is hardly possible to carry improvement any further;
  and it is to be wished that this method of distillation should
„ become general.
      But it is not so much to the form of the apparatus as to
  the construction of the fire-place, and the proper manage
  ment of the sire, that these extraordinary effects are to be
  ascribed. The posterior edge of the grate ought to corre
  spond to the middle of the bottom ot the boiler, that the
  flame may fall upon and heat the whole bottom in an uni
  form manner.         The distance between the boiler and the
  grate ought to be from 16 to 18 inches when coals are em
  ployed ; and the chimney ought to be spiral.
      Betides saving in regard to time, fuel, labour, &c. this
  form of apparatus has an influence on the quality of the
  spirit. It is far sweeter than any other, and has no empyreu-
  liutic taste; which is a fault almost inseparable from the com
  mon spirits used in commerce: this quality, which renders
  spirits of this kind so superior to others, had almost become
  cause of their being rejected, because the inhabitants of the
  north, whose principal beverage this liquor       is,
                                                      found    it too
  sweet.     It was therefore neceslary to mix with burnt spirit,
                                               it
   in order to give it   a  good name. This fiery taste may be
  easily communicated to     it   by
                                   maintaining the distillation be
  yond the usual lime.      The liquor which pastes over towards
   the end of the operation has evidently  a  burnt taste.
       In the art3,
                 it
                 is      neceslary to humour the taste and even
   the caprice of the consumer and what among us
                                  ;                       isrejected
   in consequence of its bad taste, may appear exquisite and de
   licious to an inhabitant of the north.        Burning liquors,
   which in    the north might be accounted weak, are too pow
   erful for the sensible nerves of the inhabitants of the south.
   Montesquieu has observed with great ingenuity, that to give
a     Muscovite sensibility you must flay him.
                                                                    By

     By   the       comparative                 experiments               I    have         been       able    to
snake     I
         am convinced that a little more spirit is obtained by
this method than by the old one ; the cause of which                                                           is,
that the spirit issues cool from the apparatus, and sustains no
loss  byevaporation.     The distilleries therefore in which this
improved apparatus             employed have no sensible smell of the
                                       is
spirit.
    When wines are distilled, the operation                   carried on till
the moment when the liquor which passes                        no longer in         is is
flammable.
   Wines furnish more or less spirit, according to their de
gree of strength.         Very generous wine furnishes               third of                    a
its weight.       The mean term of the product of our wines in
the south       is fourth of the whole
                     a                            there are some which
                                                                     :
furnish   a third.
   Old wines give better spirit than the new but they fur                           ;
nish  a less quantity, especially          when the decomposition of
the saccharine body has been terminated before the distil
lation.

which the liquor leaves is then sufficient to moisten the gun
powder, and to secure it from inflammation.
    liecourse has been had to salt of tartar (carbonate of pot-,
ash) for trying the strength of spirits. This alkali dissolves in
water, but not in alcohol, so that the Tatter floats on the solu
tion which is formed.
    These methods, more or less defective, have rendered it
 necessary to try other means capable of determining th«
 strength of spirit, by ascertaining the specific gravity.
    A drop of oil poured upon alcohol fixes itself on the sur
 face, or is precipitated to the bottom, according to the de
 gree of the strength of the liquor.     This method was pro
 posed, and adopted by the Spanish government in 1770 :
 it formed the object of a regulation ; but it is liable to error,
 since the effect depends on the height of the fall, the gravity
 of the oil, the size of the drop, the temperature of the atmo
 sphere, the dimensions of the vessels, &c.
     In 1772 this important object was resumed by two able
 philosophers, Borie and Poujet, of Cette, who made known
  to the distillers of Languedoc a new areometer, which they
  adopted.      They applied to it a thermometer, the different
  degrees   of  which indicate at every instant the corrections'
  that ought to be made in the graduation of the areometer, in
  consequence     of the very variable temperature of the atmo
 sphere.   »
   By the help of this areometer, not only may the degree
 of strength be ascertained, but the spirit may be carried to
 any point required; for this purpose different weights are
 provided. The heaviest is marked Dutch proof, the lightest
 three -sevenths : if the weight marked Dutch proof be there
 fore screwed to the lower extremity of the shank, and if the
 instrument be immersed in liquor of three-sevenths, it will
 sink a great deal too much ; but it may be brought back to
 Dutch proof by adding four-sevenths of water.
      On the other hand, if the weight three-sevenths be screwed
 to the shank, and if the areometer be then immersed in
  liquor Dutch proof, it will rise above the last term, and may
 be easily brought back to that degree by adding stronger al
 cohol.

must  : it concurs to facilitate the formation of alcohol, as we
have already observed from the experiments of Bullion.           It
deposits itself on the sides of the casks in consequence of rest,
and forms there a crust of greater or less thickness, rough,
with crystals very badly determined. Some time before the
vintage, when the vessels are getting ready for receiving                                            it,

   4th, Extractive       matter.     The extractive principle abounds
in  must.     It  appears    to be dissolved       in it by the help of the
sugar;     but when the fermentation changes the- nature of
the saccharine principle, the extractive matter sensibly de
creases.     A portion brought back then almost to the»state of
fibrine matter is precipitated : the deposit is the more sen
sible as the fermentation slackens, and as the alcohol is more
abundant.        This is what constitutes in particular the lees.
These lees are always mixed with a pretty considerable quan
tity of tartar, which it envelops.
    There always exists in wine a portion of extractive matter
which is in perfect solution, and from which it may be freed
by evaporation.         It is more abundant in new wines than in
old.    The older they grow, they seem to be the more com
pletely freed from it.
    These lees, after being dried in the sun or in a stove, are
well pressed, and then burnt, to extract that sort of alkali
called in commerce luood ajhes.                The combustion is effected
in a furnace, the sides of which             are raised in proportion as it
takes place    :  the residuum      is a  porous mass, of a greenish gray
colour,   which    forms   about    the   thirtieth part of the lees burnt.
    Wines are       freed   from    these   lees by drawing them off, in
order   to  preserve   them    from    acid   degeneration.
    5th, Aroma. All natural wines have an odour more or less
agreeable.       There are some, even, which are indebted for a
great part     of   their reputation to the agreeable odour they
exhale. This is the cafe with Burgundy wine.                      This per
fume is lost by too tumultuous a fermentation : it becomes
stronger by age.         It rarely exists in very generous wines;
either because it is concealed by the strong odour of alcohol,
or because the strong fermentation which has been necessary
to develop the spirit has extinguished or dissipated it. This
aroma does not appear susceptible of being extracted, to be
communicated at pleasure to other substances.                     Heat even
seems to destroy it ; for, except the first liquid which pastes
over by distillation, and which retains a little of the odour
peculiar to wine, the spirit which comes after has no longer
the characters that essentially belong to it.
    6th, The colouring principle. The colouring principle of
wine exists in the pellicle of the grapes.                When the must is
 fermented without the skins, the wine is white.                    This co
 louring principle does          not   dissolve   in  the vintage  but when
 the alcojiol is developed in it ; and it is only then that the
 wine becomes coloured. The colour is stronger according
 as the fermentation has been more tumultuous, or as it has
been left longer in the vat.            Mete pressure of the grapes by
                                                                    treading

   treacling them, isdonc with care, may mix with must a quan
   tity of colouring matter sufficient 10 make the mass a flu me a
   very intense colour.         When it is required to obtain wine free
   from colour, the grapes arc collected while the dew is upon
   them, and they are trod as little as poslible.
,     The colouring principle is in part precipitated in the casks
  along with the tartar and the lees; and when the wine is
  old, it is not uncommon to fee it entirely tree from colour.
  The colour then depoiits itself in pellicles on the (ides of the
  vessels, or at the bottom : it is seen floating in the liquid like
  films, which render it turbid.
      If bottles rilled with wine be exposed to the sun, a few-
  days will be sufficient to precipitate the colouring matter in
  large pellicles ; and the wine loses neither its perfume nor
  its qualities.     I have often made this experiment on the old
  highly    coloured    wines of the south.
      To precipitate the principle of the colour, nothing is ne
  cessary but to pour lime water into the wine.              In this cafe,
  the lime combines with the malic acid and forms a salt,
  which appears in the liquor under the form of light flakes.
  These flakes gradually deposit themselves, and carry with
   them all the colouring principle.           The deposit i^ black or
  white, according        to  tht colour of the  wine employed for the
  operation.      It  otten   happens that  wine  is susceptible of form
  ing precipitate, though
        a                          it has  been   completely freed from
  its colour by a     first  deposit; which   proves that the principle
  of the colour has strong affinity to uialate of lime. The co
  loured precipitate is insoluble both in cold and in warm
  water.     This liquid even produces no change in the colour.
  Alcohol has scarcely any effect upon       it,   only
                                                      it   acquires from
it   a  (light tint of brown.
      The nitric acid dissolves the colouring principle of this
precipitate'.
     When wine     has      been reduced to the state of extract, the
alcohol poured     over     it becomes strongly coloured, as well as
the water, though in       less degree.

 cupied hours he has left for his daily lectures and chemical
  experiments.     The principal places which he occupies are
  the following : he is a member of the Council of Elders and
  of the National Institute ; of the Society for promoting the
  Arts and Sciences ; of the Council of Health ; professor of
  chemistry in the Republican Lyceum, at theNalional Museum
  of Natural History, and the General School of Arts. His in
  defatigable, assistant Vauquelin, whose head and hands are
  entirely employed with experiments, supplies him with
  abundance of chemical discoveries, which he either confirms
   or has made himself.
      " Sometimes I paid an early visit to Fourcroy at his own
   house; for this was the only time I could have an opportunity
   of conversing with him on chemical subjects. I always met
   with the politest reception, and always found him ready to
   enter on a discussion of topics relating to our favourite study.
      " I saw C. Fourcroy's own chemical laboratory, and the
   hall in which he gives lectures on natural history.      It is not
   very large, but well fitted for his purpose, and furnished with
   apparatus and every other thing that can, serve for illustrating
                                                                  his

                      Royal Society of London.                    377
his lectures.      I found him much employed at his own house
on that part of chemistry which he has engaged to write for
the new Encyclopedic,           and which, as I saw by his manu
script,   is  nearly  finished,    and will no doubt meet with the
approbation      of  the   public.     He informed me, that as soon
as this work was completed he intended to begin another, viz.
A History of the Revolution effected in France in regard to
Chemistry, and the Foundation of the Theory respecting the
different Kinds of Gases. Fourcroy was one of those who
chiefly contributed to the establishment of those learned in
stitutions and schools which at present exist at Paris, and he
still labours for their improvement.           His principal works are:
An Essay on the Diseases of Artists, by Pamazzini, 1777,
 iamo. The Principles of Chemistry, 2 vols. 8vo. of which
there have been several editions : the last consists of eight
volumes. The Principles of Chemistry, for the Use of the
  Veterinary School, 2 parts, i6mo.            A Treatise on the aci
 dulous Springs of Engheim.             A Collection of Memoirs in

 The Philosophy of Chemistry.              And many single papers in
the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences and the Annals cf
 the Society of Medicine ; some public orations on the sci
 ences, and a few dissertations on saltpetre.
     " Fourcroy is a man about 40 years of age*, ofan agreeable
 aspect, and great activity. At present he is so much engaged
  with public business, that he has little time left for domestic
  enjoyment ; he has therefore sent his wife to a country re
  treat, and placed his eldest son under the care of his friend
 Vauquelin, at whose house he enjoys the instruction ofStany.
,    " Fourcroy in the course of his conversation seemed to have
  a great attachment to England, on account of the great pro
  gress which the sciences have made in that country, and he
  often expressed a desire of paying a visit to it on the restoration
  of peace."

    the results as fully confirming Mr. Vince's principles, that
    friction is a uniformly retarding force ; although the resist
    ance of the air and olhcr accidental circumstances introduced
   great irregularities into the experiments. He found this force
   equal to about i-4.oth of the weight : the steel spindles run
   ning on brass, with the interposition of an unctuous substance.
        The Society adjourned to Thursday the 14th of January,
   when an algebraical paper was read, of which we can give no
   idea in a short notice.
       A paper, by Smith Gibbs, Esq. on galvanism, has also
   been read before the Society ; but we have occupied so large
   a portion of our present Number with that subject, that we
   cannot at present enter upon it.
      ACADEMY OF THE USEFUL SCIENCES AT ERFURT.
       The Academy of the Useful Sciences at Erfurt, in conse
  quence of a prize of thirty ducats, offered by an anonymous
  friend of chemistry, have proposed the following question :
  What       useful application can be made in chemistry and the
  arts    of  the temperatures    below zero of Reaumur; and how
  far is it possible to lower the temperature by artificial means ?
  The Society wishes that those who undertake to answer this
  question will repeat the experiments of Lowitz, Fourcroy, &c.
  and examine whether a much greater degree of cold than any
  yet found may be produced by changing the proportions of
 the mixtures, employing them in greater quantity, by new
 mixtures, or by placing more refrigeratory vessels within
 each other, and, where it can be done, by making experiments
 in a rarefied atmosphere : also to examine the influence of
 low temperatures on the different gases shut up with spirit of
 wine; and to observe their mixture, where possible, in a
  compressed state ; and their influence also on liquids, on'
 solid bodies, and on the galvanic phœnomena : and, in the
 last place, to sliow what employment may be made of the
 low temperatures in the aris and manufactures.
      The papers on this subject mull be transmitted to professor
 Bellerman, the secretary of the academy, before the end of
 April i8ca; three months alter which the prize will be ad
judged.

astronomers. Similar, in regard to the splendour of its light,
                                                                 to.

 to a star of the seventh or eighth magnitude, it exhibited
  none of those appearances that serve to distinguish comets.
  In colour it resembled Jupiter; and, from observations made
  in the meridian by M. Piazzi and his assistant M. Caccia-
  tore, it would seem that this star is a planet, the orbit of
 which gives reason to suppose that its revolution is performed
 in four years and a half, or five years. Towards the end of
  Tluviose, as this star pasted the meridian too early, it ceased to
 be visible ; and M. Piazzi, assisted by Cacciatore and Cariotti,
 both endowed with excellent fight, and well acquainted with
  the heavens, endeavoured to find          it,
                                              but    in vain, both with
a   night-glass and an achromatic telescope of             a large aper
 ture. It   needs therefore excite no surprise that, nine months
 after, all the astronomers of Europe should have failed in their
 researches, since to the difficulty of the thing itself there was
 added an uncertaintyof some degrees respecting the exact place
 where  it    was necessary to search for this star, as the ele
 ments of its orbit, calculated on too small an arc, cannot,
 after so  long an interval, give, in       asufficiently correct man
 ner, the geocentric places. Besides, the heavens have been
 almost always cloudv    ;   and to be able to hope for success,           it
 would be necessary, considering the small size of this star, to
 make  a   correct enumeration of all the stars from the seventh
 to the ninth magnitude in the neighbourhood of which                      it
 may appear, and to repeat the examination of them every dav
 until the small planet should discover itself        by its motion.       It
will soon be under the fame circumstances in which               itwas at
 the time of its discovery    ;  aud   if the heavens should become
more serene, we may still retain some hope.

                                                collecting those made
on the preceding and following days, C. Delamore was able
to form nine series of zenith distances, observed               byBorda's
circle, which gave him tor mean result an apparent obliquity
of 230 28'   3''.    This quantity holds nearly mean place be

occasion     the observation     made at the winter solstice ap
proached very       near  that  made   at the summer solstice.        It   is

have employed themselves in determining the obliquity of the
ecliptic have always found several seconds less in winter

made at the winter solstice approached very near to that made
at the lummer solstice.         We (hall not attempt to explain the
cause.      We shall content ourselves with mentioning the fact ;
but we must add, that, according as the thermometer by
which the refraction is corrected is posited within or without
the observatory,      or near the telescope, there will be a second
less or more in the above determination for which the mean
 of these thermometers was taken.

                                 MINING.
              prospect of peace has made considerable alteration
 in the views of the miners of Cornwall and Devon. The ex
 pected reduction in the prices of the articles of which such
 vast quantities are consumed in their works, as timber, gun
 powder, iron, &c. and the probable increase in the value of
 tin at least, and perhaps of copper, have given peculiar energy
 to the carrying on the present mines, and to exertions for
  new discoveries.      Perhaps the spirit of adventure in these un
 dertakings     was  never  much higher.
     Among     the   new   discoveries is that of a course of copper
 ore,    in  the  eastern    part  of  Wheal   Fortune mine, in the
  parish   of  Gwennap,      Cornwall.      And  the same has been
  found to extend into the infant concern of Wheal Friend
  ship, a mine adjoining on the fame lode. Penandrea, un
  der the town of Redruth, is throwing up a good deal both of
  tin and copper, and the extensive mines of North Downs are
  said to be rich in the upper levels, though the bottoms have
  been stopped now for some time..
     A new copper mine is going on south of Wheal For
  tune, called Wheal Girl, and the old and great mine Wheal
  Busy, which formerly has produced so much tin and copper
  in intimate mixture, it is repoTted will speedily be put in
  course of working.
     On the eastern borders of Cornwall, and in the part of
  Devon adjoining, mining has within a (liort time been con
  siderably    extended.      Wheal Crowndale, in the parish of
                                   6                       Tavistock,

   382                          Antiques.
   Tavistock,   lately discovered,   is already producing a con
   siderable  quantity of copper ore, as also are some other
  mines of not long standing in the neighbourhood.              A new
  mine is going on, on Wheal Crowndale lode, to the west of
  that concern.
       Among minerals found of late, may be mentioned flvale
  of lime, crystallized in cubes, produced in fine pieces from
  Gunnis-Lake mine (copper lode running in granite) on the
  Cornwall banks of the Tamar, and some specimens of scaly
  iron ore incumbent on crystals of quartz from Wheal Crown-
  dale. Some quantity of the rare species of fluors crystallized
  in tetrahedral prisms has of late been collected from the waste
  3t the old lead and silver mines, not now at work, atBeerfuritf
  in Devon.
                             ANTIQUES.
      Mr. Holland,    the architect,   is in possession of a fine col
 lection of antique fragments purchased for him at Rome by
 Mr. Tatham previous to the revolution. It consists of some
 of the best specimens of ornamental sculpture, and may
 therefore be considered as an acquisition to the country, as
 the study of such models serves in an eminent degree to form
 a corredt taste in students of architecture.
      Dr. Garnett's Lectures on Zoonomia, or the laws of animal
 life, which commenced on Wednesday, the 30th of January,
have excited considerable attention, on account of the novelty
 of the subjcdr.. In the first lecture, Dr. Gamett gave a ge
 neral description of the human body, considered as a machine
consisting of bones and muscles, for the purposes of motion,
at the inltance of its intelligent principle.        He likewise con
sidered the various theories of sensation and muscular motion,
and concluded the lecture with some galvanic experiments,
which seemed to show that electricity has a considerable sliare
in producing these phænomena.
      In the second lecture, which was delivered on Saturday
last, he proceeded to consider the nature of respiration, and
the cause os animal heat.        At the request of several friends
in the City, he intends to deliver this course in Cornhill every
Wednesday evening.
     A. and C. R. Aikin will begin a, course of evening lectures
on various chemical manufactures, and the outlines of general
chemistry, on Monday the first of March next.
     The lectures will be twenty-eight in number, and will be
given every Monday and Friday, at the Aldersgate Street
General Dispensary.
     Further particulars may be learned at Mr. Aikin's, No. 4,

TArseniates
       HE   natural combination of the arsenic acid with copper,
and the different aspects under which this combination ap
pears, according to the proportions in which these two sub
stances are united, were among those objects of mineralogy
respecting which our imperfect knowledge required the aia
of  study and observation. A new copper mine, latelv worked,
called Huel Gotland, in the paristi of Gwennap, in the county
of Cornwall, having, within the last two years, enriched the
cabinets of London with some very sine specimens of these
arseniate*, I have been induced to pay particular attention to
them ; and I osftr the result of mv observations to the Royal
Society as an acknowledgment of that gratitude which I and
all Frenchmen, faithful to their king, ought to feel and pro
fess to a country which has distinguished               itself as the protector
of honour and loyally.
   Although there appears, according to some German au
thors, reason to think that arseniate of copper has been found
in Sili sia, its much greater abundance, as well as the various
aspects under which it exists, in the county of Cornwall, may
entitle it to be considered as one of the many mineral sub
stances which arc peculiar, or nearly so, to England.
   Of the various- works on mineralogy lately publislicd, there
are few which have not mentioned arseniate of copper among
the ores of this metal.            It seems, however, that some of their
authors had no knowledge of this ore, except from the very-
imperfect account communicated by the celebrated Klaproth,
jn 1787, in the Schriflen dcr GefeUschaft Katursorschender
freunde, vol. vii. in which he has given an interesting sketch
       ' From Ji.'-.' h.1;',-; 1 of ih Royal So, :tiy os latutim for |8oi.

    4                    Description       of the Arscniatti
    of   the mineralogy      of   the   county of Cornwall,
                                                     as far as it was
    then known.     Others         to have
                                    seem   possessed only imperfect
'
    specimens of arseniate of copper, as none of the forms which
    they attribute to its crystals can belong; to it. Besides, they,
      all confound with this ore those cubic crystals, of a very
      beautiful green colour, which are found in Muttrell mine,
      contiguous to Huel Gorland mine; and which, according to
    . the analysis,    made with the greatest care and ability, by
      Mr. Chenevix, are of a nature totally different, and cannot
      properly be classed among copper ores, as they contain but a
      very inconsiderable quantity of that metal.
          The existence of arseniate of copper seems, however, even
      at this day, to be an object of doubt among the French mi
      neralogists; for the abbe Haiiy does not mention it in the
       a8th and following numbers of the Journal des Mines, al
      though they contain an interesting extract of a system of
      mineralogy, which he was then preparing for the press ; nor
      has M. lourcroy even hinted at            in his Syjleme des Con-
                                                   it,
      noijsances Cbimiqites, lately published.
         It   isnow above twenty years since arseniate of copper was
       discovered in the county of Cornwall          was first found either
                                                         :   it
       in Carrach mine, in the parish of Gwennap, or in Tincroft
       mine, in the parish of Allogan.          Its matrix, like that of
       almost all th.; copper ores of this country, was siliceous, and
       consisted ofa   decomposed granite, of which the greatest part
       of the feld-spar had passed into the state known           the name  by
       off kaolin. It   was accompanied with gray vitreous copper
       ore, frequently in considerable masses       also with much black
                                                         ;
       oxide of copper; and with various oxides of iron.
           The arseniate here spoken of, which had never been found
       in large quantity, had ceased to exist in the above-mentioned
       mines, when Huel Gorland mine," lately wrought, began to
        enrich mineralogy with this uncommon substance. The ma
        trix of thisis  likewise siliceous; sometimes crystalline; and
        sometimes in an amorphous mass.           Here and there we find
        mixed with     it, in greater or less profusion, all the known
        oxides of copper     many of the argillaceous oxides of iron;
                             ;

when a piece is fresh broken, is a deep yellow ; and this
yellow coldtir is more deep in proportion as the quantity of
copper is more abundant.       In its richest state, it assumes a
niort or less greenish tint. The surface of a fresh fracture is
very brilliant, and appears rather uneven, as if composed of
small laminae crossing one another in an irregular manner.
When it begins to decompose, its surface is covered with the
molt beautiful colours; among which the most predominant
are, violet, blue, and green : this has caused it to be com
pared to a pigeon's breast.     When these colours are very
deep, and occupy the whole surface of a piece, we commonly
perceive, here and there, some little points in the state of red
oxide of iron; and others of a green colour, in the state of
green carbonate        of copper.
   This kind of        copper ore is sometimes of a deep yellow
colour, which inclines the more to green, as it is destitute of
brilliancy,      ft is very compact, and, when broken, the frac
ture appears smooth, sometimes a little conchoidal ; its fur-
face, however, has a very fine grain, which, when viewed
with a powerful lens, resembles the aggregation of a very
close compact mass of the finest sand.                Its most usual texture
is that of thin layers or plates, Iving one upon another, and
being very closely united, so as to be scarcely perceptible to
the naked eye ; but they are very readily distinguished with
the lens. These layers, however, do not adhere very strongly,
as they may always be separated by the stroke of a hammer.
   This ore frequentlv assumes a mamillated form ; the ma-
milhe being of different dimensions, from the size of a man's
head, and even larger, to that of a small pea.                  In the latter
case, the mamillæ are very              often   united,   as in that kind of
iron ore  which     is called   cluster, botryoid, or.kidney hematites.
Sometimes      the   surface   of   the mamillæ is covered with small
points ; but     more    frequently it is smooth, so as very much to
resemble    a  piece   of  polished metal ; and, as the surface of the
mamillæ      inclines     rather    to a brown colour, they have the
appearance     of  antique     bronze.      The green oxide of copper,
which   sometimes       is  observed    onit,    completes the illusion,  by
assuming     the   aspect    of   that   fine   patina which often covers
pieces  of  antique     bronze.

although these colours are frequently very deep, they never
are so brilliant as in that kind.
     It is very uncommon to find pieces of this ore that are not
mixed, and frequently even penetrated, with gray vitreous
copper ore.      That which accompanies the arseniate of Huel
Gorland mine, offers, in this respect, an uncommon and
very particular appearance.       The yellow ore is mechanically
mixed with the vitreous ore, so as to form a compound, in
which, by the assistance of a lens, the small particles belong
ing to each of those two ores may be very clearly distinguished.'
The specific gravity, as well as the quantity of copper, in this
ore, varies considerably, according to the proportions in which
the yellow copper ore and gray vitreous copper ore are mixed
together j sometimes they teem to be mixed in equal propor
tions, or nearly so.
     Nature has established very remarkable differences between
the arseniates of copper; and these take place not only in
their forms, but likewise in their hardness and specific gra
vity.      These differences arise, either from the manner in
which the arsenic acid is combined with the copper, or from
the different proportions in which these two substances are
 combined.       I have been naturally led to follow the fame
order, and to divide the arseniates of copper into four different
 species: and the very interesting analysis of this substance,
 made by Mr. Chenevix, has afforded me the most satisfac
 tory sanction to this division.      It is thus that the chemist
 and the naturalist, by freely uniting their labours, without
jealousy or prejudice, ought in all cases to proceed, in order
 to attain that certainty which is the desirable recompense of
 their endeavours.
 First Species.  —Arseniate of Copper    in the Form   of an obtuse
                              Oitdedron.
      The most simple form under which this species appears, is
 a very obtuse octaedron, formed by the united bales of two
 tetraedral    pyramids, with isosceles triangular planes ; and
 this appears to be its original form.       This octaedron has, in
 each of its pyramids, two opposite planes more inclined than
 the other two; which gives a parallelogrammic form to their
 common base. (Fig. i. Plate I.) . The two planes more in
 clined than the others, meet at the apex of each of the py
  ramids, in an angle of 130°; and at the common base, in one
 of 50 \ The two planes which are less inclined, meet at the
  i:>ex, in an ingle of j 15°] and at the base, in one of 650.

                            of   Copper and os    Iron.            7
   These planes are commonly smooth and bright; some
times, however, they are striated in a direction parallel to
their edges.
   The four planes seldom terminate in one and the same
point : more commonly the apex is formed into a ridge, the
octaedron being lengthened, parallel to its less inclined planes;
the base is then a square, or at least approaches very nearly
to that form. (Fig. a.)
   These two varieties are the only ones I have observed in the
form of the crystals of this species, although I have had the
opportunity of examining a great number of specimens.
   This arseni.ite is very light; its average specific gravity,
taken on six pieces perfectly pure, was 3,081.           Its hardness
is likewise very inconsiderable ; it easily scratches calcareous
spar, but makes no impression on fluor spar.
   It is seldom perfectly transparent, but has generally a
cloudy alpect.
   The usual colour of this species (for this character is as es
sential in metallic substances as it is immaterial in stones) is
a beautiful deep fley-blue; sometimes, but very rarely, it
inclines more or less to Prussian blue.         It is frequently of a
very   fine grafs green ; the crystals  have   then   a much more
beautiful transparency. I have seen some which were of a
fine apple green; others white, having a slight blue cast.
In one piece, the crystals of which were of a green colour,
and less transparent than they commonly are, I discovered,
on breaking them, that the colour of their central part, for
about half their thickness, was blue.       From the observations
made by Mr. Chenevix in his analysis of these arseniates,
it appears that the variation in their colour principally de
pends on the quantity of water which enters as a constituent
part into their formation.
   This species is found mixed with all the other kinds of
arsenical copper ore ; but that which most commonly accom
panies  it,    the prismatic tricdral species.

  This    species  commonly found in very fine hexaedral
                     is

8                    Description of the Arsemaies
it. (Fig. 3.) A? far as the   small size, and more particularly the
thinness of these crystals,    has enabled me to judge, two of
these three inclined sides form an angle of abo'it 135° with
the broad planes on which they incline ; and the third, one
of  1 15°.
    The two broad planes are smooth, and have a very bril
liant lustre.     The six narrow sides are rendered very dull by
the great nurnber of striæ with which they are covered ; most
of which are very prominent, and all are parallel to the
edges of the broad planes.          In consequence of this, these
crystals may be divided, parallel to the planes, almost as
easily as crystals of mica.
    This structure prevents the crystal from being considered
 as a modification of the octaedron : that which would be
 produced by an increase of the inclined sides, would only be
 a secondary crystal ; and none of the specimens I have seen
 give me reason to suppose the existence of such a variety.
    The colour of this species is a fine deep emerald green ;
 sometimes,     though rarely, it is found of a lighter colour.
 The lustre     of its broad planes, which are the only parts of
 the crystal    that forcibly strike the eve, give it pretty much
 the appearance of those coloured metal plates which are
 known by the name of foil.
    This species is still less heavy than the preceding, its spe
 cific gravity being only 2,548.
     It is also lei's hard; it easily scratches gypsum, but not
 calcareous (par.
     When its crystals arc very thin, they. are very transparent;
 but their transparency is diminislied when they have any
 degree of thickness.
     When exposed to sire, this species decrepitates very strongly.
    This arfeniate, the matrix of which is generally quartzous
 is occasionally found mixed with some other alternates of
 copper, and particularly with the acute octaedron in the car
 pillary or fibrous state. (Spec. 3. Var. 1 aud 2.)         But the
 ore most commonly found with it is the red copper ore,
 which is frequently very abundant.
     I have never observed in this species any appearance of
 decomposition.
 Third    Species. —Arfeniate of Copper     in the Form  of an   acute
                               Octaedron.
    The most simple form in which this third species is found,
 is likewise an octaedron ; but this octaedron, instead of being
 obtuse, like that of the first species, is slightly acute.    It has,
 like that, in each of iU pyramids, two opposite planes more
                                                             inclined

     Theaverage specific gravity of this arfeniate                                        of copper,

are grouped in the fame manner as in that.
   Substances in a crystallized state, in passing from a deter

form of this variety, of a light green colour, and also of a
very delicate white.
                      Variety 5. Hematitiform.
    This variety  is  in layers, either flat or mamillated ; and i9
of a fibrous texture; but is rendered compact by the close
manner in which the fibres are united to each other, in the
fame way as is observed in many martial hematites, and
more particularly in that kind of tin ore which is known by
                                                                  the

the name of -wood tin, to which some pieces of this arseniate
of   copper have   a very great resemblance.      Yet it  sometimes
happens, a? in many aggregate pyrites of a globular form,
that the surface of the small mamillæ is covered with little
rough points: these arc the dicdral apices, which terminate
the little crystals supposed to contribute to their formation.
    This hematitic variety is found with the fame diversity of
colours as the preceding, or amianthilbrm variety.
Fourth    Species. — Arsenide of Copper, in   the Form  of a triedral
                               Prism.
    The primitive form of this species is a triedral prism, the
bases of which are equilateral triangles,           (fig. 9.): this
prism is often considerably lengthened in a direction pa
 rallel to one of its bases. (Fig. to.)     This form is one of the
most: rare in crystallography.     The crystals have all their fides
smooth and brilliant; yet there are observable in some of
them, when examined with a magnifying glass, transverse
 siriæ on the sides of the prism, all of which are parallel to
 the edges of the bases.      It is therefore chiefly on the planes
of the oases that the crystalline laminæ appear laid upon one
 another, to produce either the increase or the modification
 of the primitive crystal.
     As the crystals of this species are seldom sufficiently de
 tached to be easily perceived, and indeed are very frequently
 so small as to escape the observation of the naked eye, I think
 it necessary to describe here all the various forms in which I
 have seen them, with the progress observed in their passage
 from one form to the other, however small the difference
 between these forms may appear.            Such a description will
 lead to a better knowledge, not only of the primitive crystal
 itself, but also of those forms of it which seem to be the most
 distant from its original one.
     Very frequently the triedral prism passes to a tetraedral
 modification by the simple replacing of one of its edges by a
 plane equally inclined on the adjacent ones.          This plane is
either very narrow, (fig. n.) or of a more considerable width.
 (Fig. 1 a.) Sometimes the width of the plane is such, that it
 reduces the primitive adjacent planes to extreme narrowness.
 (Fig. 13.) In this last cafe, the crystal appears under the
 form of a rectangular plate or lamina, having two of its nar
 row opposite sides or planes inclined, in one and the fame
 direction, on one of the two broad planes. It sometimes
 happens, in this variety, that the two broad opposite planes
 approach more or less to a square form. (Fig. 14.)            I have
 also seen some crystals in which the two other edges of the
                                                                prism

  12               On preserving Fresh Water sweet.
   rism seemed      to have  likewise very slight secondary planes /
  Eut, when that happens,       they are always very narrow, espe
 cially when compared with the secondary plane of the third
 edge.     This modification, in its various forms, is the most;
 common one of this species.
      Sometimes one of the solid angles of the triedral prism is
 replaced, on one side only, by a plane that is much inclined
 to the edge of the prism on which it is situated ; but the crys
 tals are always too small to admit of being measured with
 precision. (Fig. 15.) This plane, assuming a more consi
 derable extent, replaces the fame edge of the prism by an
 other plane, much broader at one extremity than the other,
 as is shown by the lines of large dots in the fame figure.
 Sometimes it has a very considerable extent, as is represented
 in fig. 16. It then reduces one of the bases of the triedral
 prism to the form of a very narrow trapezium, while that of
 the opposite base remains very broad.          By a. still more consi
 derable increase, the plane of this base totally disappears, and
 the crystal is terminated at that extremity by a ridge. (Fig. 17.)
 In this variety, the crystal is often seen placed upon one of
its scalene triangular sides, and then presents the other at its
 upper extremity ; an appearance which is apt to puzzle the
observer, particularly when he perceives, among the trian
 gular sides which most generally terminate the crystals, no
thing but equilateral triangles.          This modification, in all its
forms, is much less common than the preceding one ; it is,
 however, occasionally met with.

II.    On preserving Fre/b Water         sued during long        Voyages.
                  By   Samuel Bentham, Esq.*
  1 HE       Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. having
thought proper to offer a premium in order to ascertain, for
the use of the public, the bust mode of preserving fresh water
sweet at sea, I request you to lay before the Society an ac
count of the method which I have employed for this purpose
on board two (hips, and which has bten attended whh all
the success that can be reasonably expected.
    The mode in which T conceived fresh water might be pre
served sweet, was merely by keeping it in vessels of which
the interior lining at least sliould be of such a substance as

should    not   be acted  upon by the water,     so as to become   a
cause   of contamination.        Accordingly, on board the two
ships  here   alluded to, the  greater part of the water was kept,
not in casks, but in cafes or tanks, which, though they were
made of wood, on account of strength, were lined with me
tallic plates, of the kind manufactured bv Mr. Charles
Wyatt, of Bridge-street, under the denomination of tinned
copper- sheets ; and the junctures of the plates or stiects were
soldered together, so that the tightness of the cafes depended
entirely on the lining, the water having no where access to
the wood. The stiape of these cases was adapted to that of
the hold of the ship, some of them being made to fit close
under the platform, by which means the quantity of water
stowed was considerably greater than could have been stowed,
in the fame space, by means of casks ; and thereby the stow
age room on board ship was very much increased.
    The quantity of water      kept in this manner on. board each
fliip  was about forty     tons, divided into sixteen tanks ; and
there was likewise on      board each of the sliips about thirty
tons stowed in casks as     usual.
    As the stowing the     water in tanks was considered as an
experiment, the water in the casks was used in preference;
that in the tanks being reserved for occasions of necessity,
excepting that a small quantity of it was used occasionally for
the purpose of ascertaining its purity, or when the water in
the casks was deemed, when compared with that in the
tanks, too bad for use.
    The water in thirteen of the tanks on board one fliip, and
in all the tanks on board the other, was always as sweet as
when first taken from the source ; but in the other three of
the tanks, on board one sliip, the water was found to be
more or less tainted as in the casks.        This difference, how
ever, is easily accounted for, by supposing that the water of
these tanks was contaminated before it was put into them;
for in fact the whole of the water was brought on board in
casks for the purpose of filling the tanks, and no particular
care was taken to taste the water at the time of taking it on
board.
    After the water, kept in this manner, had remained on
board a length of time which was deemed sufficient for expe
riment, it was used out, and the tanks were replenislied as
occasion required : but in fome of the tanks, on board one
sliip at least, the original water had remained three vcais aud
a half, as appears by the certificates herewith inclosed. About
twenty-five gallons of the water, which had remained this
length of time in the {hip, are lent to the Society, in two ves

    A certificate from captain William Boston, commander of
the said vessel, dated Shcerness, 28th of June 1800, accom
 panied this letter, stating, that the water delivered to the
 Society was taken from a tank holding about seven hundred
 gallons, and which his predecessor, captain Portlock, had
informed him had been poured into this tank in December
 1796, except about thirty gallons added in 1798, and had
remained good during the whole time.
    The signatures to the above accounts were certified on the
 28th of June 1800, by the Rev. C. Thee, minister of Sheer-
ness.
    In a letter dated January 27, general Bentham also states,
that the water which had been preserved sweet on board his
majesty's sloops Arrow and Dart, and of which he had sent
specimens to the Society, was taken from the well at the
king's brewhouse at Weevil, from whence (hips of war lying
at or near Portsmouth are usually supplied with water for their
sea store, as well as for present use.
III.    Description of a Machine for raising Water.                 By Mr.
        H. Sarjeant, of Wbitebaveriy in Cumber/and".
Isih, AM    sensible that the little engine, a drawing of which
accompanies this letter, can lay no great claim to novelty in
its principle ; nevertheless it is respectfully submitted to the
consideration of the Society, how far iis simplicity, and cheap
ness of construction, may render it worthy of their attention,
with a view to its being more generally known, and used in
similar cases.
    Irton hall, the feat of £. L. Irton, esq. is situated on an
ascent of fixtv or sixty-one feet perpendicular height ; at the
foot of which, at the distance of about 140 yards from ihe
offices, runs a small stream of water.                The object was to
raise this to the house for domestic purposes.
    To this end a dam was made at a sliort distance above, so
as to civile a fall of about four feet ; and the water was
brought bv a wooden trough, into which was inserted a piece
ot two-inch leaden pipe, a part of which is seen at A. (fig. 1.

 been since removed.          But the above supplv being more than
 sufficient, the machine is occasionally stopped to prevent
 wear, which is done by merely casting off the string of the

 a manner that one is sometimes tempted to believe that they
 are in contact. I have presented to these plants metals, stones,
 and the branches of trees, sometimes green and sometimes
 dry, the figures of which were infinitely varied, and always
 observed that the spirals they form adhere, by immediate
 contact, to the whole length of these bodies.           I tried to
 change the direction of these spirals, to make them ascend
 or descend from left to right, if they inclined before from
 right to left; and they always yielded to these changes with
facility in a very little time.
    Til. When they are abandoned to themselves, and find no
bodies near them to which they can attach themselves so
as to climb around them, they creep along the ground, fall
back on themselves, become interwoven in a thousand dif
ferent ways, and force themselves into the ground : they ex
tend to a great distance son every fide, and form a net of
spirals closely united.
    IV. After having long studied the character of these
plants, I must confess that I am acquainted with no mecha
nical principle by which the movements and singular pro
perties which they exhibit can be explained. This kind of
instinct, which makes them search for neighbouring bodies
to assist them to rife; those spirals, which they constantly form
as they grow up ; those angles and those folds, which are
sound always proportioned to the figure of the bodies they
meet with; the facility with which their stems, even when
exceedingly hard and robust, can fall back upon themselves,
and form angles so much the smaller as the bodies to which
they attach themselves arc slenderer : all these jphænomena,
absolutely contrary to the rectilineal progress affected by the
fibres of plants, as well as by their vessels and the liquors
they contain, make me suspect, in those which we examine,
a new principle of sensation and life.
    V. It must not be believed that the ipom&a bifpida thus
twists round upon itself merely because it is formed of spiral
fibres, and that all its movements are only a necessary effect
of its interior organization. Such an opinion is entirely void
of foundation.    It would indeed be fruitless labour to search
for these pretended spiral fibres by the help of the microscope,
for that instrument exhibits only rectilineal fibres and canals.
Besides, I have always found by experience that the direction
of these plants may be changed at pleasure; that, if the spirals
they describe around any body are formed on the right, they
may be immediately turned to the left, and vice versa. Their
movements, therefore, can be ascribed neither to any peculiar

   VI. Ivy is the only plant, and perhaps the only body, with
which they do not sympathize : they are not fond of uniting
with      it,
           or twisting themselves around it.                If anv external
power    unites   them     to  that  plant,   and  forces  them    to describe
around      it  certain number of circumvolutions, they endea
                 a
vour to avoid              it,
                       to disembarrass themselves from               and they   it,

twisted itself several times around different neighbouring bo
dies, abandons the spirals              had begun to form, and recedes

towards thole bodies which                   embraced, searches for them

           natural instinct, and again twists itself around them,
following the spirals              described before.
                                     it                    These spirals are
situated in         direction from the top to the bottom, or from
                      a
the bottom to the top, according to the position of the point
which terminates them. Indifferent to every kind of direc
tion, they constantly follow that given to them, without
obeying either the laws of gravity, or those                               by
                                                                 which other
plants   Teem    to  be  regulated.
    IX. All these phenomena cannot be explained                          simple       by
mechanism: they seem to be the effect of principle of sensa       a
tion and life;          principle which
                           a                      discovered several years
                                                        I
ago   in  the  tremellæ      of Dillon,    and  some   other smaller plants,
as yet little known, of the family of lijirons, and of which                               I
have demonstrated           the existence                   by
                                                   evident proofs, as may
be seen in my different works.                These proofs have never yet
been contested            any observer or philosopher.
                               by
   X. Life and sensation are sound to be obscured among
certain animals which have very little analogy with man and
with common animals, and to become the less apparent as
their organization differs from ours.               Sometimes, even,
                                                                                           it
                                                                                           is
difficult to believe that they enjoy real life; and this disco
very can be made onlv                the laborious researches of the phi
                                         by
losophic    observer.       Several    of these animals are destitute of
                                                                            the

                 Observations        on the   Ipomaa Hifpida.            19
the organs of hearing, fight, taste, and smell. There are
whose families which have not the organ of voice, that pow
erful mean for discovering sensation ; and the sense of touch
itself is sometimes so obscure by the absence of those sensible
movements and violent agitations manifested by other ani
mals in consequence of any stroke, that it cannot be known
whether it is produced by sensation, or by any other^principle
unknown, and merely mechanical.              Even the organs of di
gestion, which in other animals are internal, can Be supplied
in the family of the polypes by the external organs, and even
by the skin itself.      It is well known that these animals form
a kind of elongated bag, if they are turned, like the finger of
a glove ; the stomach becomes skin, and performs the func
tions of   it,  while the skin becomes stomach, and digestion
continues.
   XI.  It   was formerly thought that, to ascertain whether an
organized being; belonged to the animal or vegetable king-
dom;  it   was sufficient to divide        into several parts
                                              it                but at
                                                                ;
present   we   are  acquainted   with    multitude
                                              a     of animals  which
may be divided without destroying them, and which even
multiply, like some plants, in proportion as they are divided.
   XII. The little analogy, therefore, which exists between
our organs and those of plants, and even the absolute priva
tion of certain organs, will not permit us to obtain certain
and evident proofs df the life and sensation of vegetables. For,
if we suppose that all plants are endowed with sensation, and
that it
     is     even much more exquilite than our own, how can
we ascertain whether their mode of living and feeling be dif
ferent from ours,        their organs have no relation to oiir or
                         if
gans,    and    ifthey are  entirely deprived of those which could
act upon ours        ?But though we cannot prove directly, and in
an evident manner, that plants feel,                    by
                                                    no means thence
                                                   it
follows that plants arc incapable of feeling as well as animals,
and even in a much more exquisite manner.                 We cannot
without temerity, and without exposing ourselves to the danger
of falling into error, refuse to nature power which stie ex
                                                   a
ercises, perhaps, over all organized beings.
   XIII. Motion, perhaps, is the most certain character by
which animals are distinguished, and that which rarely aban
dons them    :   without      we should be obliged to consider as
                              it
inanimate an infinite number of beings in whom life               mais
nifested in the most evident manner                by
                                                the rapid movements
of their different parts movements which can in no manner
                               ;
be ascribed to mere mechanism, but which are necessarily
                by
                 sensation    and yet these movements sometimes
Eroduced
  ecome    so flow, and       so ;
                              obscure, that they are capable of ex-
                                      B   2                   hausting

hausting the patience, the sagacity, and the talents of the
most indefatigable philosophic observer.
    XIV. But if the vital movements are obscure in a very
great number of animals, they become almost imperceptible
in plants. I do not here speak of those movements, so well
known, of the sensitive plant, the bedysarum gyrans, and the
stamina M several others, which, as soon as touched, move
and contfect themselves.        It would be difficult to prove that
these movements are really vital, and that they arise from
sensation : they appear to me to be purely mechanical, though
we may be ignorant of the real mechanism which produces
them; and they have a great analogy to those which depend
on the elasticity or spring of certain machines which, when
once wound up, unbend themselves, and continue to move
as long as the force and principle by which they were put in
action exists.
    XV. The indefatigable botanist Dillon studied with great care
the small tremella, tmt he did not discover those movements
which it constantly manifests to the eye of an attentive philo
sophic observer.      Adanson went (till further, but without ob
serving   in it any thing that depends on a real principle of life
and sensation. Having become the object of my researches, it
exhibited to me a great number of movements still unknown,
and of the greatest importance.         After having carefully exa
mined,     and,  as I may fay, analysed them, it appeared to me,
as may be seen in my works, that they might conduct to a
real principle of life altogether different from mere mecha
nism.      But I must confess there are only two plants the life
and sensation of which I was able to demonstrate in an evi
dent manner, and so as to leave no doubt; and these two
plants are very small, and even microscopic.            They have
little if any analogy with other plants ; and though they ex
hibit all the properties by which vegetables are characterized,
some even may class them in the animal kingdom.                  But
whatever may be the case, and however important the ques
tion may appear, it cannot destroy truths founded on facts
and observations-      It is much to be wished, for the progress
of science, that the life and sensation of common plants could
be proved, and that it were possible to show that these quali
ties, so wonderful, and at the fame time so obscure, do not
exclusively belong to animals, but that they are extended to
all organized beings.
    XVI. I opened the entrance into this laborious and diffi
cult path by some observations, which were indeed very im-
            on the convolvuli ; a kind of plants which are very
fierfect,
  arge,  and  well known to every body. Animated solely by
                                                             a desire

entirely deprived of it ; and from my own observations I am
induced to believe that no animal can live without air, and
without a quantity, more or less considerable, of oxygen ;
though we are but imperfectly acquainted with the manner
in which it acts, how it is respired by the different animals,
and by what means they are able to separate it from the dif
ferent substances with which it is united, 3nd which can
more or less alter its purity.
     XIX. What    is certain       that small eels, susceptible of
                                          is,
 being recalled to life, die    deprived of air, or
                                     if                 care be not    if
 taken to renew        and
                         it
                          ;   would be lost labour to attempt to
                                    it
 reanimate them,       the water in which they are immersed
                          if                                                       is
 not in contact with rcfpirable air. They live only            very          a
 short time in eVery kind of water deprived of that air. They
 die  in hydrogen and nitrogen         though these gases are not
                                                ;
 prejudicial to them of themselves; and do not occasion to
 them sudden death, like the greater part of the other gases,
 without even excepting carbonic acid gas.           appears, then,
                                                                  It
that oxygen contains the vital principle; and the principle                        it
has of maintaining and preserving life, induces us to believe
that  if    does not communicate           directly,   can at least
                                                        it         it
awaken     it, it
             and put       in action. The small animals above
                               it
mentioned are an irrefragable proof of this assertion.        They
remain dead as long as they are deprived of oxygen, but its
presence immediately restores them to life and motion.                             It
may therefore be said that       contains the direct principle of
                                         it
life, which     infuses into them
                    it                  or that their vital organs,
                                                    ;
in order to be reanimated, stood in need only of this aliment,
of which thev were deprived.
    XX. The absolute need which plants have of air order                    in
to vegetate and be preserved, renders         highly probable that
                                                             it
   serves for the fame purposes among animals           and that
                                                                                   a it
it                                                                     ;
ought to be considered in these two classes of beings as
principle from which life flows, in the fame manner as an
effect from its cause.      Besides, vegetables are organized as
                                         B      3                                well

well as animals ; they increase also by nutrition ; and though
this function in both follows laws different in their details
and application, we may however assert, that plants have in
general more resemblance to our small eels, than the latter
nave to common animals.            A plant, indeed, may be dried to
a certain degree, some even may be reduced to a state of
perfect desiccation, without losing the property of vegetating
as before; whereas the slightest desiccation or animals            is, in
general,  sufficient  to deprive    them   of life for ever.     The di
versity of these phenomena             is,
                                       no doubt, owing to the sim
plicity  of  the  organs   of   plants and of our microscopic eels,
and, above all, to the facility with which the latter can be
dried, which prevents the corruption and dissolution of their
organs while this dissolution
       ;                                unavoidable among common
                                            is
animals which have        very complex organization, and whose
                          a
humours naturally tend to corruption,            This, however, in no
manner destroys the great analogy which exists between these
two species of beings an analogy founded in particular on
                              ;
the circumstance of both having equal need of oxygen for
their existence.
   XXI. Generation, that mystery,                so
                                                 obscure    inits princi
ples, which belongs no less to plants than to animals, forms
the second kind of analogy between the two classes of organ
ized beings, and induces us to believe, that where the organs
are the fame, and have the fame uses, we ought to find also
an identity of wants.      Vegetables and animals have distinct
genital  parts   of  separate    sexes, male and female organs in
different individuals, and exhibit efforts in these different
sexual parts to consummate the act of fecundation.                  Since
the sexual organs, and the manner of reproducing themselves,
are common to the two grand families of organized beings,
do they differ in sensation"? And this difference, so impro
bable between beings          like in other respects, and the only
                              so
one of the kind, perhaps, that can be found in nature, on
what  is    founded
           it         ?   Is     on our organs and mode of sensa
                                  it
tion not being in harmony or unison with that of plants? Was
there ever any reason weaker, or less philosophical          ?
   XXII. The movements of the male organs of plants
which perpetuate their species, and the manner in which
they prepare for thaf grand work, seem to me to deserve par
ticular consideration, and further research.          I  propose to un
dertake this labour, or rather to continue it; for          I    haveal
ready been employed on this object under various circum
stances, and    am of opinion that the sum of my observations
                I                                                        is
sufficiently decisive to enable me to assert, with some founda
tion, that the movements              which, different beings repro
                                       by
                                                                     duce

                   Observations        on the Ipom^ca           li'ifpida.               23
 duce themselves, are not the result of mere mechanism, but
 that the grand act of generation is executed by a principle of
 sensation which regulates and directs it :  however, appears   it,
 that this sensation abandons plants as soon as the end of na
 ture    accomplished.
         is              Thus we fee different kinds of ani
 mals die when they have ensured                     the     reproduction of their
 species.
    XXIII.        It then highly probable that plants as well as
                       a is
 animals enjoy       principle of life and sensation, whatever be

be cut off, it continues to fly about, to walk, to leap, and to
climb as before; its regular and uniform motions, sometimes
slow and tranquil, sometimes quick and animated, exhibit
nothing convulsive, nothing that resembles those violent agi
tations which accompany pain.          In a word, the number and
rapidity of these movements, as well as the time that these
flies can live, are subject to no fixed rule.
     Let us stop for a moment to consider the movement of
their legs; they are equally various and wonderful as those
by which they can move the whole of their body.
     XXV. To appreciate properly the different movements per
formed by an animal in a state of health or of disease, it is
necessary to have an exac\ idea of the circumstances in which
it is placed, of the motives and impulses which in general
induce it to move; in a word, we must be acquainted with
its nature and character.        This being premised, it is easy to
observe, that of the nine kinds of movement to which those
executed by flies in a state of health may be reduced, eight
still subsist even aster they have been deprived of the head.
Scarcely has a           a fly
                         been decapitated when         seen to move
                                                                it
                                                                is
its hind legs for      long time, and at different periods to cross
 them, either standing up or flying, to rub them along its body,
 to hook jhe one into the other in the form of           wheel, and
                                                                 a
 to agitate them in         thousand ways with wonderful rapidity
                                 a
 and regularity.      All these movements, which constitute the
 first kind here treated of, are absolutely similar to those per
             by by
 formed       a. fly, when, possessing perfect  health, and being
 harassed      no fear or want,       appears to move only for its
                                            it
 own pleasure.       These movements, then, seem to be produced
 in these two states,            so
                           opposite,             by
                                        the fame principle, that is,
 sensation and volition.
     XXVI. The second kind of movement results from their
 hind legs, which they raise up towards the interior edge of their
 wings   ;   that
             so           by
                        these means they are elevated, and placed
 in different directions. The object o*f these movements, ex
 ceedingly varied, though constant, seems to be, to rub, beat,
 and poliih their wings.       Their hind legs can execute     third  a
 kind of movement, no less varied, when, conveying them
  above their wings, 'which they keep extended,            they rub
 them, beat them, and poliffi them, as           the preceding cafe.
                                                           in
 Their middle legs also are often observed to be twisted around
 those behind, and to rub each other mutually; which forms
  two new kinds of motion different from those we have exa
  mined.

sion animals, as to the elephant and whale.       Nothing    contemptible in

                                                                      XXVII.

conveying their legs and thighs around their head, which
they rub and polish in various directions.       It is evident that
this movement cannot take place after they have been de
capitated.
    XXVIII.     Flies certainly would not exhibit these phæno-
mena if they experienced as acute pain aswarm-blooded ani
mals when subjected to decapitation, which is constantly
followed by speedy death. Will it be said that these different
movements suppose, on their part, neither pleasure nor recrea
tion, but rather a need which they experience of rubbing and
polishing their legs, their wings, and different parts of their
bodies ? But if this be the cafe, we must be forced to confess
that decapitation does not prevent them from being sensible
to small privations and old habits, which are by no means
 necessary to their existence ; a manifest proof that it occasions
no pain to them, or at least that it is exceedingly flight;
 otherwise they would not attend to things of ib little import
 ance.
    XXIX.     Cold-blooded animals could supply me with many
 examples of a similar kind ; but I shall content myself with
 mentioning only one, furnished by the tortoise.        If the head
 of this animal be cut off, or, what is still better, if its brains
 be scooped out with dexterity, it seems to be scarcely sensible
 of the operation ; it continues to walk as before, it a/cends
 and descends, avoids those obstacles which it meets with,
 turns itself to different fides, stands up on its hind paws, and
 performs movements of every kind ; and though its paws are
 covered with a hard and scaly skin, if they are slightly touched
 even with a feather when it is walking, or has been a little
 irritated, it immediately draws them back, and remains some
 time at rest : in a word, its sensibility seems to be so little
 altered, that it feels the smallest impression made on its shell.
  Tortoises live in this manner five or fix months without any
  change being observed in their movements or habits : there
  are even certain movements which they execute with more
  readiness and surety than in their state of integrity.     Such is
                                                                that

     0.6           Observations   on the Ipomaa        Hifpida.
   that by which they turn themselves on their belly, and stano
   up on their hind paws. They at length die at the end of
   fix months ; but it appears that their death ought to be
   ascribed rather to hunger than to the operation to which
   they have been subjected, since those on whom it has not
   been performed die in the fame time if deprived of nourish
   ment.     If the tortoise in this state experiences real pain, were
  it even very slight, it would certainly not feel the weak im
  pressions made on the shell which covers it ; for it is well
  known that a very strong impression entirely effaces that
  which is very weak.
       XXX. The facts I have established will, no doubt, find
  many opposers. This must be the cafe. They are surprising;
  have even something of the marvellous; and tend, in parti
  cular, to destroy errors hitherto considered as incontestable
  truths.
      XXXI. We, however, know that sensibility is very weak
  in animals at the time of their birth ; that it is gradually
  expanded with their organs ; and, when come to its highest
  degree, it begins to decrease by insensible gradations until it
  is at length entirely extinguislied, when the animal dies.                 It
  is easy to observe these different degrees of sensibility in ani
  mals attacked by diseases, or subjected to experiments of this
 kind.
      XXXII. I might here add, that no naturalist is now igno
 rant that the small eels which have been the object of my
 observations, and which are found in different kinds of the
 gall-nut, can pass insensibly from the state of death to that
 of life; die again, to be afterwards revived, if circumstances
 admit ; and that the number of these different resurrections
 is still indetermined.      It is more than twenty-fix years since
 I publistied, in different journals, the observations which con
 firm these truths ; and I have demonstrated,              in the most evi
 dent manner, that these small animals may be revived at
 pleasure; that they enjoy this singular faculty as long as
 they are hermaphrodites, but (hat at the moment when they
 assume a sex they return to the common law, and, when
 once dead, can no longer be revived.               I have even found the
means of giving them a sex at pleasure, and these means are
those employed by nature for perpetuating their species*.

     making Cast Steel from Bar Iron by means of ibe Decom

 IN
 which
           the present extensive state of the iron trade in Britain,
             exceeds in that manufacture alone the collective exer
 tions of all Europe, every discovery which may lead to elu
 cidate the principles of this art, and place them upon a per
 manent foundation, or which may remove those local disad
 vantages, the inevitable consequence of the use of pit-coal,
 become highly interesting. To counteract the inferior effects
 produced by this otherwise invaluable combustible in the
 conversion of cast into malleable iron, and to produce British
 bar iron equal in quality for all purposes, steel-making in
 cluded, to the foreign fabrics, would be an attainment of
 much national importance.                Multiplied beybnd precedent
 have been the modes devised within the last fifty years ; but
 as they have been merely modifications of each other, with
 no essential change of principle in the operation, the results
 have been consequent           to the unvaried nature of the means.
Every new idea, therefore, ought to be seized with eagerness,
 accurately examined, and put to the test of experiment. Ul
timately great improvement may be drawn from a hint loosely
thrown out, or even derived from experiments, which, though
at first fight engaging, may neither carry with them convic
tion of principle, nor be productive of eventual utility.             Im
pressed with a full conviction of these truths, the process for
 converting iron into steel, communicated by the French che
mists in the Journal des Mines, No. 45, appeared to me de
serving of a fair examination.            To this process I alluded in
my last communication, and to it I shall now particularly
attend.
     The report of citizens Guyton and D'Arcet to the French
National Institute, announcing this discovery, sets forth,
that C. Clouet, among other inventions, had devised a
method of converting iron into steel by means of the de
composition of the carbonic acid in lime.                To prove this,
lumes in quarto.      I have need only of a few moments of philosophic Ici-
iure to put the last hand to it ; but, can I hope for it after having been

                                                                   several

 »8                    New      Process   for making
 several experiments are          detailed with a degree of minutenef
 bordering upon        demonstration.
     The report slates, that a y^d part of carbon is sufficient to
  convert iron into steel : a quantity of          it,equal to ^th of the
 weight    of the   iron,   gives
                                a    quality   of steel   more fusible but
 still malleable ;     but beyond that term         it  approaches to cast
 iron, and has no longer sufficient tenacity. By increasing
 the dose of carbon you increase the fusibility, and              passes at
                                                                    it
 length   into   the  state  of gray  cast iron.
     In pursuance of the proportions here laid down, we find
 the report prescribes, that     a    mixture of carbonate of lime and
 argil, comprising a-3ds         the  weight of the iron, must be em
 ployed,    viz.   i-3d   the  weight of the iron of carbonate, and
 the fame proportion of argil. These are to be introduced into
a  crucible along with fragments of iron, exposed to heat for
a time sufficient 10 effect fusion, and that the result will be
found steel.
    That C. Clouet applied the proportion of 1.3d of carbonate
of lime, from calculation of the quantity of carbonic acid
                                                                              by it
                 a
contained, and thence the quantity of carbon disengaged
its probable decomposition, will appear very evident from an
analysis of the experiments performed                    by
                                                         citizens Guyton,
D'Arcet, and Vauquelin.
    The quantity of iron operated upon in this experiment
was 6914 grains.           Admitting, according to Clouet, that T'sd
part   of  carbon     was    sufficient to convert this quantity into
steel,  then   2i6r6T grains of carbon are requisite tor this pur
pose.     We   find that one-half of the flux used amounted to
3304 grains of carbonate of lime.              If we suppose this united
with 36 per cent, of carbonic acid, then the resulting quantity
of acid will be 829/44 grains. Granting, according to La
voisier, that the component parts of carbonic acid are 72 of
oxygen and 28 of carboy, then             by  the following formula we
have   —- —  ¦         =   232*5 grains        of carbon, nearly.        Grains.

This  small difference  easily accounted for

acid contained in the lime used           by
                                     Clouet.

The pieces of iron were imbedded in, and completely
covered by, the mixture of earths.      The crucible was
exposed for 35 minutes to a high heat, when the mix
ture was supposed to be reduced.         The result was a
fine dark green glass, transparent towards the edges,
covering a perfect regulus of metal. Upon close exa
mination, a few traces of imperfect crystallization were
visible upon the upper surface. The under surface wa9
marked with deep pits or honey- combs, but nothing
which betokened any great degree of division having
taken place while the metal was fluid. — This product

equal to T*Td part the weight of the iron introduced.       From
the dark colour of the glass I inferred that a quantity of iron
equal to the deficient weight might easily be diffused through
out the mass.
   The quality of this metallic button was minutely examined,
and the following characteristics rigidly ascertained :
   The mass was partially cut acrois with a chisel, and with
difficulty broken cold over an anvil. The fracture displayed
a considerable quantity of fibre ; a few imperfect granulations,
of no determinate form, were also visible, but possessed of a
small degree of comparative lustre.       One-half of the button
was forged at a cherry heat. It drew into a square shape with
facility; but the action of the hammer, even at this low
heat, expressed a considerable number of sparks. The solidity
of the bar, notwithstanding the fusion, was far from being
complete.     At a high red heat, a (light hammering dissipated
the particles of metal like cast iron.
   One end of the bar was plunged into water at the ordinary
heal for steel. This produced no alteration, and the bar bent
several times without breaking.       When again hammered, it
was plunged at a bright red : the surface then shalsd a little,
           4                                                  and,

 and, upon being touched by the file, felt perceptibly harder*
 The fracture ot the piece thus hardened was of au open re
gular grain, approaching somewhat, in point of colour, to
malleable iron.      A fracture from the unhardcned part of the
bar was precisely that of bar iron made in the puddling pro
cess ; a dark blueisti fibre breaking short across, without tear
ing out in groups. But before I allowed myself to draw any
conclusion from this experiment,       I  deemed it necessary to
repeat it as follows :
   Exp. II. The quantity of iron now operated upon Grains,
was              -                                          1331
To which were added i-3d of the fame carbonate of
lime, or 443 grains j i~3d of Stourbridge clay (old
pot), 443 grams.
This mixture was arranged as in No. 1. The cru
cible was introduced into the furnace, and in 30 mi
nutes I judged the fusion entire. A metallic button,
as in No. 1, was found, beneath a dark green glass,          . '   *
which weighed               -          -           -         13 \%
                                            Lost in fusion       19
equal to T'6th part of the original quantity of iron introduced.
   The glass obtained in this experiment, upon comparing
fragments of equal thickness, was found one shade lighter
than in No. I,. The upper surface of the metallic button
exhibited a more perfect approach to crystallization than in
No. t. This supposes a more perfect fusion had been ef
fected. The under surface contained one large pit, the in
terior surface of which was strongly marked with a streaky
crystallization.   The fracture was also brighter, and the grain
more distinctly formed than in No. 1.
   A bar forged from one-half of the button drew into a
shape at a low red heat.        At a white heat it stood a few
blows ; but, in returning through the intermediate heats,
dissipated like hot sand.      A fragment well hammered, and
plunged    into   water at a  low red heat, exhibited no sliale,
and bent easily orer the anvil.     When plunged at a bright
red heat, a fair proportion of sliale turned up.        The piece
then felt similarly hard, under the file, with No. 1. The
hardened fracture was open, distinctly granulated, and bright.
A fracture of the unhardened part of the bar was blueisti,
tough, without grain ; nearly two (hades lighter in the colour
than No. 1. This circumstance, along with others formerly
mentioned, was most probably derived from the superior
degree of fusion which the product underwent.
   The same experiment was several times repeated with
                                                           nearly

                       Cast Steel from  Bar Iron.                   31
nearly similar results as to loss of iron.        The quality of the
metal was found invariably the fame. I therefore deemed
myself warranted to draw the following conclusion, that with
the quantities of mixture prescribed by the French chemists
for converting iron into steel, I had not been able to obtain a
product which, under the various tests, exhibited the proper
ties of cast steel.     But, from the result of the foregoing expe
riments, I did not think myself at liberty to infer, that al
though the usual marks of steel had not been perceptible,
steel could not be formed in this way. Aware that carbonates
of lime differ much in their respective quantities of carbonic
acid, and proceeding upon the supposition that the carbonate
used by C. Clouet might afford a greater quantity of carbon
aceous matter, I resolved to make up in quantity of earth
what probable deficiency might have arisen from an inferior
quantity of carbonic acid. — To ascertain this point, I made
 the following experiment :                                     Grain*.
     Exp. III. I used of small pieces of iron           -
                             i
 To which were added of carbonate of lime, or 671I
                                                                1342!
 grains ; 4 °f Stourbridge clay pot, 671- grains.
 The quantity of carbonate here used exceeded that em
 ployed bv Ciouet in the proportion of 9 to 6, and ought
 to have given out to theiron, every thing else being alike,
 a portion    of carbonaceous matter     equal to
                                                  — -ths    the
 weight     of the iron employed.         This mixture was
 fused   in 38 minutes, and, as usual, a metallic button
 found under the fused earths which weighed               -     13^5\:
 Loss equal to 7'-th part of the weight of the iron fused          17
 The glass appeared to be a minute shade lighter than No. 2.
 The upper surface possessed a few imperfect radii, a com
 mencement of the usual crystallization.             The under sur
 face was similarly pitted with No. 1 and 2 ; and no altera
 tion of quality could be inferred from the external cha
 racter of this button.        The fracture of it when broken was
 entirely   fibrous, and   tore asunder somewhat like lead. Under
 the hammer it cracked less than did the former two.            It was
 next double-welded, and drawn a second time ; cracking a
  little, and throwing off a few sparks.       In hardening, and in
  every stage   of the  subsequent   examination,   I could detect no
  circumstance that would warrant the supposition of one addi
  tional atom of carbon being in combination with this iron
  beyond that possessed by Nos. 1 and 2. The property of its
  standing a higher heat, and exhibiting a tougher fracture, are
  circumstances rather the reverse, but which a more attenu
                                                                   ated

 j»                    New  Process for   making
 ated or less perfect fusion  will, I conceive, satisfactorily ac*
 count for.
     In order further to elucidate this subject, now pregnant
 with doubts as to the efficacy of the carbonic acid,
     Exp. IV. was performed as follows :                      Grains.
          Iron introduced                     •¦
                                                                1468
             Carbonate of lime         -       930 grains,
             Stourbridge clay pot      -       930 grains :
this proportion being     of each of the mixtures 5-8ths
 the weight of the iron, and to C. Clouet's proportion
 as 6*35 to 3-33 ; nearly double.       From this mixture,
 still following his calculation, should have been ob
tained steel, approaching to cast iron in point of sa
 turation of carbon.
    The fusion was completed in 3a minutes, and a
very perfect crystallized button of metal was produced,
which weighed                                          ~
                                                                *434
                                               Lost in fusion     34
equal to ^th part of the original weight of iron introduced.
    The glass now obtained was darker by a marked (hade than
that obtained in experiment No. 1. This circumstance, and
the increased quantity of glass, may in some measure account
for this experiment losing more iron than any of the former.
The external figure and density of this metallic button was
in noway altered from the former results.          It underwent the
fame minute examination as did buttons Nos. 1 and a, and
in no instance afforded the least perceptive difference in point
of quality.
    Exp* V. was performed as follows :                        Grains.
          Iron introduced         -                            I3°7
             Carbonate of lime       -     .1960 grains,
             Stourbridge clay pot *          1960 grains.
This quantity exceeded that of C. Clouet's in the pro
portion of 3 to *666, and of course contained nearly
five times the quantity of carbonic acid.        This ought
to have afforded a result in gray cast iron.
    The fusion was completed in 30 minutes, and a
metallic button, as usual, obtained decumbent to a
very ponderous mass of glass, and weighed               -      I275
Lost in fusion, equal to ^th part of the weight of the iron, 3a
    The glass obtained in this experiment, upon comparison,
was found to be exactly the fame with No. 1. The great
deficiency of weight, in the proportions of 40 to 73, may be
                                                          accounted

                    Cast Steel    from Bar Iron.                   33
accounted for by taking into consideration the extra quantity
of  earths introduced, and fused in contact with the iron. The
vitrid mass had imbibed as large a {hare of the colouring
principle, from whatever source derived, as that in the first
experiment, where not above i-5th part the weight of the
earths were used to a nearly similar portion of iron.               The
metallic button now produced was subjected to the fame tells
with the former, aud results exactly similar in every stage of
the examination were obtained.
   The results of the foregoing experiments, I conceive, will
with safety admit of the following deductions:
   That in treating malleable iron with anv of the foregoing
proportions, of an equal mixture of carbonate of lime and
some vitrified Stourhridge clav-pot, results in fusion are ob
tained the qualities of which differ so little from each other,
that no change seems to he. derived from altering the propor
tions of the earths prescribed : That in no shape nor form
docs iron in this (late approach to what is commonly under
stood to be (tcel ; nor can           anv cafe where elasticity, edge,
                                 it,
                                 in
and polish, are requisite, be used as     a  substitute for it.
     Itmight, however, prove      a  curious subject of inquiry, and
in the end be productive of considerable utility, to inves
tigate the principle of alteration that takes place in this
process.    The iron loses in weight from T'0th to 7',th part,
depending most probably,         in some measure, upon the quan
tity of earths used.     If the deficiency consists of iron alone,
there can be no reason assigned why the resulting button
of metal should be          so completely altered in its properties.
This becomes deprived of its malleability when heated be
yond      bright red, and particularly of the property of weld
          a
ing.       acquires additional softness when cold
          It                                             ;  and in that
state will flatten astonishingly, without rending, or exhibiting
the smallest crack.
    C. Clouet, in fusing iron and glass, attributes to the latter
the property of combining with the former. Were               a    com
bination of earths with iron supposed in the present case, this
would naturally add to the weight of the product, unless             a
greater quantity of iron united to the glass than left the glass
to unite with the iron.         Again, this supposition involves the
exertion of    a double affinity, wherein     a   preference of predis
posing   cause  cannot   be   attributed  to  the   one more than to
 the other.    It will therefore remain for experiment to decide
 whether the alteration in quality of the iron      is    occasionedby
 an assumption or   a  loss of principle.
    Exp. VI. Before     I  finished this part of the examination of

34      Process   Jar   making Cast Steel from   Bur Iron.
C. Clouet's    process, I deemed it of importance to make the
experiment    that  follows :                             Grains.
            Iron introduced         -        -             1399
Carbonate of lime, the fame as formerly used, 1399 grs.
From this mixture, by fusion, was obtained a very
dense mass of iron, possessed of a smooth radiated sur
face, different in every external feature from the reguli
obtained in the former experiments.       It weighed       1317
   Lost in fusion, equal to T',th part the orisrinal weight,       82
This  extra loss of metal, however great, appeared (till more
so upon breaking the button, and detecting in its interior a
considerable portion of incorporated glass.         From the appa
rent quantity found in this state it may be fairly presumed
that T'ith part the weight of the iron employed had disappeared
in the fusion.     The glass, in point of colour, was green, ap
proaching     to black ; its fracture, in point of lustre, resembled
the polisli of sine black marble.
    Upon subjecting part of the metal now obtained to the
hammer, it was found soft in the extreme when cold, but
in no state would stand the effect of slight hammering beyond
a low red heat.      A piece beat out, heated pretty high, and
plunged into water, turned up a rich and uniform shale, so
as to make its surface resemble tin ; but the same, when at
tempted to be broken, bent seven times before it parted. The
grain then, far from resembling the close uniform grain of
cast steel, presented a silky fibrous appearance.          In this re
spect it differed materially from the results obtained in the five
former experiments.         A bar, T\ths square, plunged hot into
water, and suffered to cool slowly, had assumed a partially
crystallized fracture, resembling some varieties of American
red-short bar iron.      In seeking for a solution of the phæno-
mena which appeared in this experiment beyond those in
the former, it may be supposed, upon the principles of the
theory advanced by C. Clouet, that the superior density of
 the button was in consequence of a greater degree of division
in the fluid: that this, in part, might be occasioned by the
oxvgen set free by the decomposition of the carbonic acid :
 that part of this oxygen might seize upon the iron, and, while
these conveyed an unusual degree of colouring principle to the
glass, might at the fame time account for the great deficiency
of metal.
   This subject, of the greatest importance to a just theory
of the component parts of the various modifications of iron,
will meet a copious investigation hereafter. Suffice  for theit,
                                                               present

                      On the Strength of Acid i.                   35
 present    to draw the following conclusion, warranted bv the
 foregoing experiment : That when equal portions of iron
 and carbonate of lime are fused together, a metallic button
 is the result, even less allied to steel than the products of
 experiments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    The iron used in these experiments was drawn down from
 a bar of excellent Swedish iron, a fragment of which was al
 ways put in competition with the products obtained bv fusion.
 In these, the only appearances that indicated ileel were,
 (haling, and slightly hardening when plunged hot into water.
Both of these properties were, however, much more con
 spicuous when a piece of the misused bar, was subjected to
 the same tests. In short, all good foreign bar iron, when simi
 larly treated, is susceptible of the same display of properties.
    It may be here proper to observe, that the carbonate of lime
 used in these experiments was the fame throughout; that,
after being dried in a temperature of 180^ of F. it yielded in
distillation 39 per cent, of carbonic acid.

       S  I do not remember to have seen anv table showing the
correspondence     between the specific gravities of acids and the
degrees     of the pefe-liqueur (areometer) of Baume, and as I
 am possessed of a good instrument of BaumeAs, and have exa
mined the nitric acid of different specific gravities, and made
a  comparison with the above instrument, 1 am enabled to give
a sufficiently accurate idea of what strength of acid is meant
when Baume's areometer is quoted.             1 remember, a few
years ago, being     much    at a loss to understand   the power ot
acids expressed by the French chemists according to Baume,
and made many inquiries amongst our chemists without ob
taining the information wished for; and as the experiments
made on the continent are generally described according to
the areometre de Baume, and much read in this country, I
have annexed a table of those various degrees of nitric acid
which have been examined and compared with the French
instrument ; and if you think them worthy a place in your
Philosophical Magazine, you are welcome to insert them.             It
is not pretended that this scale is accuracy itself, though I am
confident it will be found sufficiently so for most purpoles ; and

it is surely very essential to have a clear idea of the power and
strength of an acid used in various metallic solutions.
   This comparison         was made in September last, and the
temperature     about   60.     Having a stock of acid of the specific
gravity 1435,      a little   distilled  water was daily added, and
the gravity taken the day after each addition of* the water ;
then the areometre de Baume was immersed with the follow

culate the degrees of Baume both above and below those al
ready compared and examined.                 I had no acid of higher
gravity   than   1435,   nor  did  I  descend    lower than 1150; which
is a weaker acid than used in most metallurgic operations.

unfortunate Indians and negroes, who traverse the woods
almost always barefooted, to search out the most efficacious
remedies for the disagreeable effects produced by the bite of
these animals.    Of the remedies hitherto discovered, none is
equal to the juice of a plant of the creeping kind called vejuco
Jit guaco ; for it not only cures the maladies arising from
the bite of serpents, but preserves from these effects those who
have drunk of it before they are bitten ; so that the negroes
and Indians acquainted with this plant, lay hold, with their
naked hands, of the most venomous serpents without sustain
ing any injury from them. This knowledge, of which they
formerly made a great mystery, gave them much importance
in the country ; and there is no doubt that they gained a
great deal of money, both from those who were bitten by
serpents, and from those who were desirous, through curiosity,
to fee them handle these dangerous animals.
    Being born in the kingdom of Santa-Fe, belonging to
South. America, I had often heard the inhabitants boasting
of the great ability of these negroes, whom my countrymen
 call empirics.  But as in the capital, where I was educated,,
which lies in a cold district, there are no venomous serpents,
 I had no opportunity of seeing any till the year 1788, when,
being at Margerita, I heard of a stave who had a great re
 putation as being invulnerable to serpents, and who belonged
 to a gentleman of that place.     As I was resolved to examine
 him myself, I begged his master to fend for him, with a suf
 ficient provision of serpents ; which he readily consented
to do.
   On the 30th of May, the same year, the negro came to
the house where I resided with, one of the most venomous
serpents of the country, which he had put into a calabash ;
a    kind of     vessel   employed by these people for the same pur-
    oses as bottles      are employed in Europe.    Having informed
i:  im that      I   was desirous of seeing a specimen of his talents,
he     replied       that he was ready to gratify my curiosity, and,
taking the serpent from the calabash, handled it with so
much confidence and composure, that I imagined he had
              deprived it of its teeth that contained the poison,
frevioufly
   therefore caused him to open its mouth : but I saw that it
still had its teeth ; and was convinced that the negro possessed
some secret for soothing          it,
                                for    appeared as tame and harm
                                        it
less as the most innocent animal could have been.          After a
Joni conversation with the negro, of whom asked severalI
questions, to which he gave the most pertinent answers,            I
informed him how much              siiould be gratified
                                    I                     could be

ing that he was not averse to procure me that satisfaction, I
ofiered him a recompense,          with which he seemed satisfied.
Next morning      he  returned   with   the leaves of the plant in
question,   which    he  moistened,    aud,   having hruifed them in
my presence,    made   me   drink  two   large spoonfuls of the juice.
    He then made three incisions between my singers in each
hand, in which he inoculated me with the fame juice: he
performed a similar operation on each foot, and on each fide
of my breast.     When these operations were sinistied he in
formed me that I might lay hold of the serpent.                I made
several observations to him in regard to the disagreeable con
sequences to be apprehended          in cafe I should De bit bv the
animal; but finding that be seemed confident in his skill,
 I resolved to take it into my hands without any fear; which
1 did several times, the animal never making the least attempt
to do me any injury-        One of the individuals, however, who
were in the house, being desirous to run the fame risk, was
bit by the serpent the second time he took it in his hand;
but without any further inconvenience than a slight inflam
mation in the part.
    Two of my domestics who had been also inoculated, en
couraged by this first attempt, went out into the fields and
soon brought with them another kind of serpent, equally ve
nomous, without sustaining any hurt from it.             In a word, I
have caught several since that time without any other pre
paration than that of having drunk a little juice of the vejuco
du guaco ; and after repeating these trials, either on my
self or my domestics, and always with the completest suc
cess, I resolved, in 1791,10 give a memoir on this remarkable
antidote in a periodical paper published every week at hanta-
Fe. I added a description of the plant, and every thing that
appeared to me necessary for rendering public and general
this discovery so useful to mankind.           An account of all my
experiments, and of the persons who were present, will he
found jn that paper, dated Sept. 30, 1791.
    I shall here only observe, that the tradition current among
the Indians and negroes of the vice-roystiip of Santa-Fe, re
specting the manner in which the virtue of this plant was
discovered, is as follows: — A bird of the kite kind, described
by Gates by under the name of the serpent-hawk, feeds cliieflv
upon snakes in the hot and temperate regions of that part of
America. This bird has a monotonous cry, sometimes very
disagreeable by its repetition, which imitates the articulated
word guaco, on which account the inhabitants have given it
that name; and these people say, that when it cries it is to
call forth the serpents, over which it exercises a certain kind
                                                                 .  of

classed  in any book of botany I have ever seen ; and for
that reason I shall venture to give a description of it as
well as I can, taking advantage of the memoir above men
tioned. The root is fibrous, and extends in every direc
tion.     The stum is straight, perfectly cylindric when the
plant is tender, but when old becomes pentagonal, that is to
fay, acquires salient angles.   The leaves which grow on the
stem stand opposite to each other ; are shaped like a heart ;
have a dark green colour intermixed with violet ; are smooth
on the lower fide, rough on the upper, and somewhat vel
vety : its corymbiferous flowers are yellow, flosculous, and
have four fleurons in each common calyx. The corolla is
monopetalous, infundibuliform, with five indentations; and
contains five stamina, united by antheræ in the form of cy
linders, which embrace the style.      The style has a stigma
deeply divided, and the calyx contains several broad seeds,
each with a silky aigrette.
   The plant is vivacious, and is found in the hot and tem
perate regions of the v ice- roy (hip of Santa- Fe ; it
                                                              in is,

places,  rather than  in the open plains. Nature has not pro
duced      in the elevated or cold districts of this continent;
           it
and for this reason, no doubt, that its virtue would be useless,
as there are no venomous serpents but in the countries where
it grows.

exceedingly well tasted, but they are not numerous.             The
other kind frequent the impenetrable bustles and marshes on
the sea coast, where they live on crabs and roots.          Thev are
not so large as the European swine, are of a graver colour,
and keep in large herds.        The latter, at certain periods of the
year,   in  herds  of  sometimes   a thousand, swim from the one
fide  of   the  river   Siak to  the  other, at its mouth, which is
three or sour miles in breadth, and return to the former at
stated periods.      This passage takes place also in the small
islands, by their swimming from the one to the other. On
such occasions, these swine are hunted by a tribe of the Ma
lays, who are not Mahometans but heathens, and who are
held in great contempt by the other Malays, who will neither
suffer them to inhabit among them nor to approach them.
On this account they were obliged formerly to live more at
sea than on land, in small boats covered with mats, until the
king of Siak lately permitted them to establish themselves in
the uninhabited districts on the sea coast. They are called
in the Malay language the Salettians, and by the Dutch the
Lard Malays.           They are better made and of a brighter
colour than the other Malays ; have only one wife each,
whereas it is well known that the other Malays admit of
polygamy.
    The women are said to be remarkably well made, and to
retain their charms much longer than those among the other
Malays and inhabitants of the sea coast ; so that at the age
of forty they look as well as the latter at twenty. They go
 half naked, and wear only a piece of cloth wrapped round
 their loins, which hangs down to their knee.               They are
much addicted to strong liquor, particularly arrac ; and when
 they fee an European vessel, their first inquiry is after that
 beverage, for which and tobacco they give every thing they
 have, and sometimes even their daughters and nearest con
 nections, to be kept for a certain time as servants, but not
 slaves.    They arc much more attached to the Dutch than to
 any other nation, and have the greatest intercourse with
 them.      Thev are much afraid of other nations, and particu
 larly the Malay pirates, because the latter carry them away
 and sell them as slaves.
     On such occasions thev defend themselves with great
 braverv by mean's of slings, with which thev hit a mark very
 accurately at a great distance.       Thev can use also, with great
 dexteritv, a fort ot javelins made of very hard wood, with
 which     they can strike fisli at a considerable distance at the
 surface   of the sea.    When these javelins arc to be used against
 robbers, they harden the points of them in the fire, and dip
                                                                tin in

them in lemon juice, by which means the wounds they in
flict prove highly dangerous, and often mortal.
    Some of the Salettians inhabit also several small islands,
not frequented by the other Malays, which lie in the straits
of Sinkapoor ;' but these are not so/civilized as those who live
near Siak, and often while out fishing, or hunting swine,
carry off many Portuguese and other fishermen, whom they
sell as slaves.
    They hunt the swine at sea at different periods, when these
animals, through natural inltinct, emigrate as above men
tioned.     The Salettians, on these occasions, smell the swine
long before they see them, and make ready their boats.
They then fend out their dogs, which are trained to this
kind of hunting, along the strand, where, by their bark
ing, they prevent the swine from getting on shore to
conceal themselves in the bushes.          During the passage, the
 boars go first, and are followed by the female swine and the
young ones, all in regular rows, each resting its snout on the
rump of the one before it. These animals, swimming in
 long rows close to each other, form a very singular spectacle.
    Ihe Salettians, men and women, meet these swine in
 their small fiat boats.      The former row, and throw large
mats, made of the long leaves of the pandamus odoratijjima
interwoven through each other, before the leader of each
 row of swine, which still continues to swim with great
 strength ; but, soon pushing his feet into the mat, gets so
 entangled that he can no longer move them, or moves them
 only in a very slow manner.        The rest of the row, however,
 are neither alarmed nor disconcerted, but keep close to each
 other; and none of them leave the row, or the position in
 which they are placed.         The Salettians then endeavour to
 row towards them in a lateral direction ; and the business of
 piercing the'swine is consigned chiefly to the women, each
 of whom is armed with a long large javelin, in the form of a
 spontoon, headed with iron, and with which they stab as
 many of the swine as they can reach, always drawing back
 the weapon.        Besides this instrument, they have also a
 number of smaller javelins, about fix feet in length, without
 iron points, which they carry in their arms, ancl which they
 throw to the distance of 30 or 40 paces, in such a manner
 as to kill those which they cannot reach with the long javelin.
 As it is impossible for them to throw mats before all the rows,
 or to kill all the swine in so sliort a time, the rest of these ani
 mals swim off in good order, and in regular rows, towards
 the place where they arc taught by instinct that they frail
 find better nourishment, and for this time escape the danger
                                                                  till

till  they return to their usual place of residence.        As the
swine which have been pierced float every where around,
they are picked up and put into larger boats, which follow
for that purpose.
    If these hunters fall in with any vessels belonging to the
Chinese, of whom a great many are settled at Malacca, and
who on such occasions become ready purchasers of their
booty, they fell to them their swine, and receive for those
that have an inch and a half thickness of lard on the breast
at the rate of a piaster a- piece.       It may readily be believed
that none of them are purchased by the Malays ; for, being
Mahometans, they abhor swine's flesh, and, consequently,
these pagan swine-hunters; to whom they do all the mischief
they can, by destroying their huts, robbing them of their pro
perty, and often assaslinating them, without ever being called
to an account by any one for their depredations.
    Of the swine which they cannot sell, they first cut off the
head; thev then skin them and cut them up, chiefly for the
sake of the lard, but save as much ot the flesh as may be ne
cessary to feed their dbgs, and throw the rest into the sea.
They then row their boats, laden with lard, to a solitary
place on the coast unfrequented by the Mahometan Malays,
where they melt the lard, and preserve the grease in large
earthen vessels, or bojans, which are manufactured in Siam.
This grease they sell to the Maki Chinese; and it is used not
only by the common people instead of butter, as long as it is
not rancid, which is seldom the case in Malacca, but also
for burning in their lamps instead of coco-nut oil.

                      Inquiries into Coloured Light.                      43
    The process of this theorem is founded on the experiments
actually made bv Sir Isaac Newton, and on some further
experiments and reasoning, which his quæries suggest.
    I wish this imperfect attempt may excite some real philo
sophers to take up this point of inquiry.
    IT appearing from Dr. HerfchePs observations,                 published
in the Philosophical Transactions 1796, that the                 solar light
does not proceed from the fun as an igneous body, but appa
rently from inflammable and inflamed vapours floating on
the surface os its atmosphere ; aud it having been long known
that this white lucid light could be decomposed into a num
ber of coloured rays,' each homogeneous, as has been sup
posed ; each
                  "  originally endued," as Sir Isaac Newton says,
"with     its respective    colour;" or, as he otherwise expresses the
fame     fact*,    "  with that which each is originally disposed to
exhibit ;" it occurred to my mind, on reading this in the year
 1707, that these observations of Dr. Hcrichel, if finally found
to be true in nature, and followed up by an induction of
combining facts, might lead to a discovery of that property of
light which hitherto appeared to me to be inexplicable, at
least unexplained, viz. that every the minutest ray of which,
it consists is a compound of seven, or three, principal primary
homogeneous coloured rays, each originally endued with
its respective colour, as constituent elements of this lucid
white light.
    It occurred to me, that if Jimilar coloured lights, arising
from the aerial inflamed vapours, or flames of bodies com-
bured in our terrestrial atmosphere, stiould be found to observe
the same refractions, and by these refractions, as they never
are purely homogeneous, should in their decomposition ob
serve and be affected by the same laws as operate on the solar
light ; the solar light may, by direct analogy, be supposed to
be only a compound of inflamed vapours taking the respec
tive colours of their flame, and being endued with their re
spective refractions, according lo such attractions as the re
spective substances from which they arise are liable to. Whilst
1 considered this, I recollected        that I had read in, and learned
from, Sir Isaac Newton, speaking of flame, according to an
expression which he used at that time,
                                                   " as smoke red hot,"
that,    "  according to the nature of the smoke, the flame is of

                                                                     various

 various colours, as that of sulphur, copper blue; that of
 opened with sublimate, green," &c.
     To investigate this analogy according as the various lights
 which come to our fenses present themselves to us, I here
 directed my inquiry, ist, To learn what colours the various
 inflamed vapours of terrestrial bodies combured in our atmo
 sphere throw out : 2dly, Whether these colours were homo
 geneous ; and if not, 3dlv, How far they observed such simi
 lar refractions in their decomposition as the solar light doth.
 From the ground of a speculative opinion, which I nave long
 entertained in my own mind, that, although the white lucid
 light of the sun is only a compound, yet light as light exists in
 a lucid, homogeneous, elementary, white and uncompound-
  ed state, and only becomes otherwise by mixing or passing
 through oxygenous and other airs, or such vapours as result
 from combustion, and, by being suffused with the colours fur
 nished by these, becomes less ana less pure, and, consequently,
 tainted with colours. I applied my observations first to the
 electric spark. From the instantaneous and transient nature
 of this light, the decomposition could not be examined : it is
 known, however, that electric light passed through an exhausted
 receiver exhibits tremulous rays of various colours somewhat
 similar to the aurora borealis; so that it comes out that this
 light is a compound. The next light which met my attention
•was that of the sparks of iron deflagrated in vital air. Although
 I could not examine this by experiment for the fame reason
  as before, yet I may venture to pronounce that, this being
  nothing but the white heat of fused iron, it must be a com
 pound light.     The next was the very brilliant light of phos
  phorus burnt in vital air, so blazingly bright, that no eye
  can stand the first stroke of it. The next was the lucid
 light of camphor inflamed by spirit of wine, whose blue
 may be supposed, in some degree, to tinge the brilliancy of
 the white: these decomposed into a faint spectrum of the
  principal colours.      The next was the light of spermaceti
  burnt in Argand's lamp, wherein the smoke is in great
 measure consumed.         This was said by Dr. Franklin to come
  the nearest to day-light of any other terrestrial light.     This
  decomposes    into   red  and  yellow, somewhat    greenish  as it
  runs into the blue. The flame of wax was the next light:
  this has a suffusion of yellow, and decomposes into a red and
  greenish yellow and blue.      The flame of tallow was the next,
  which Sir Isaac Newrton calls yellow : this decomposed into
  a red, a blueish green, and blue.
     From the ground of a reason which will be given below,
                                                            J began

mine red ; and I learn that nitrate of strontian gives to the
flame of spirit of wine a bright carmine red. Dr. Gibbesf
showed me another instance of muriate of strontian giving a
suffusion of red to the flame of spirit of wine.                    Nitrate of
lime, formed into the salt called Baldwin's phosphorus, does
the fame.
     I am taught that nitre, distilled with half its weight of sul
 phur, gives a. yellow % acid liquor yielding red fumes.
     Hydrogen and carbon, united with oxygen in the con
stituent parts of animals and with azote in vegetables,
 form oil and fat : the flame of these is yellow or yel
 lowish, as the flame of sulphuric and bituminous bodies is
 blue suffused with green; the yellow of the former runs into
 reddifli fumes, the blue of tho latter into greenisti fumes.
 The oleaginous parts of bitumens being yellow, explains the
  reason why their blue flame is disposed to green.                   Verdegris
  inflamed with (pirit of wine gives out a green flame ; but
  this decomposes into a red and blue, with an intermediate
  blue -green.
      Although these coloured flames and vapours are not ho
  mogeneous, yet they observe, according to various attractions
  which the aeriform substances, their respective bases, are lia
  ble to, the fame laws of refraction and decomposition as the
  solar light doth, the primary colours of which are not them
  selves homogeneous.

         It may be worth noticing, by the by, that as this yellow liquor give*,
   in its aeriform staic, a red fume ; so sulphur, yellow in its solid form, gives
   out, in its aeriform state, a blue flame.
                                                                               As

     As substances acidified by oxygen "differ from each other
  only according to the several natures of the oxygenated or
  acidified bases," why may not this be the cafe ot coloured
 flame or vapour ? Their colour differs only according to the
 nature of the bases thus illuminated by their combination
  with light.
     In examining       and observing upon these facts *, both by
  prisms and lenses, in this comparative view, it appeared these
 terrestrial coloured flames and aeriform vapours combured in
 our atmospheric air, observe the same laws of refraction and
  decomposition as the solar light in every instance which can
  be brought under experiment.               And that, as the solar light
  proceeds    from    inflamed     vapour   on    the surface of the fun's
 atmosphere,       as  Dr.   Hcrschel   states,  this  solar light must arise
 from vapours having similar bases as these terrestrial coloured
 lights have, allowing for an apparent different purity; and must,
 having the fame properties, be of the fame nature.                    So that,
 although     the  solar  light, coming     to  our  fight  in  its compound
 state, is a bright lucid light ; yet, being decomposed by the
 different refractions, which the several substances or bases
 from which it proceeds are liable to, it is resolved, exactly as
the terrestrial lights above examined are, into the constituent
 coloured lights which the several bases give out.
     I will not venture, on the ground of the observations stated,
 aud on the reasoning attached to them as above, to lay it
down as a proposition absolutely proved; but will hazard t
 it as a quære, open to further investigation.
     May not the fun, an unignited body, and similar to our
 terrestrial globe in all its external appearances,               (but possibly
of variety in its mineralogy,) produce an atmosphere of more
    * It is hardly worth while to describe the method I observed to do this,
yet it may not be amiss.      I had prepared a tall long box, painted black on
the inside, with a sliding door in the fiont, in which was bored a hole
about half an inch diameter : the use of this sliding door was to raise or
lower the hole to the height of the coloured light which I had occasion to
try.    There was also a door on the side by which to put in the lights, and
a valve at the top to let out the smoke when 1 mould observe that it as
sented the light.    By applying a prism to this hole, I obtained from all the
lights, except the blue, a prismatic spectrum : the light of the blue was so
Weak, that I could not obuin a spectrum from it coming through the hole ;
I therefore drew up the sliding-door entirely, and so turning the ptism as
to direct the refradted rays down upon the ground near under the table on
which the box stood, and into the dark, obtained, yet imperfectly, the spec
trum above noticed.      By lenses applied to the hole, the ditfereuces of the
different focuses were as the refractions inversely.
    t  This I stated to Dr. Hersehcl by letter, dated March 17, 1747 ; and
had afterward a conversation with him at Slough on ijais subject of the
coloured rays of the solar light.
                                                                     sublimed

                   Inquiries into Coloured Light.                           47
sublimed and purer vapours than our earth does; and so ex
hibit purer and more homogeneous coloured lights than the
terrestrial inflamed vapours do, although in every other re
spect of a similar nature?             May not this explain the reason
why   some    of  the   fixed   stars,  also suns, appear of a green or
red colour?     for, if their bodies consist of a different mine
ralogy, and the vapours of their atmospheres be thus disposed
to throw out different, as for instance green and red lights, in
a greater proportion than the other colours, they will thus,
ofcourfc, have this or that appearance of being green or red;
which is a known phænomenon. Nay, even the white lucid
light of the fun, apart all consideration of circumstances which
may affect it as it comes through our atmosphere, gives out at
times a somewhat differently suffused white, according as this
or that constituent of its compound light may be in a greater
or less proportion.          /
    May not the moon, producing an atmosphere visible where
no light of the sun can reach, and therefore not a reflected
light, possess, as a planet, an atmosphere very different from
what those suns produce, perhaps of a phosphorescent nature,
which exists with little heat ? And may not the visible
atmosphere of Venus, consisting of enlightened vapours, be of
the fame fort ?. I will strengthen the proposition of this quære
from the opinion o( Dr. Hcrfchel on this planet: " It cannot
shine (he fay*) by a borrowed light, so that this faint illu
mination must denote some phosphoric quality in the atmo
sphere   of Venus."
   Thus far I proceed         in mv researches on the ground of the
solar lisrht being a compound of various rays, supposed to be
originally disposed to exhibit seven or three primary colours;
which colours are also supposed to be homogeneous. A doubt,
however, has always occurred lo me, first, whether this opi
nion of the homogeneity of the seven primary colours be
founded in fact: and, in the course of examining this first
doubt, a further doubt arises, whether there ase. seven or only
three principal colours, as Sir Isaac Newton expresses it ; or
whether there be more than two, and perhaps not more than
one.    Stating then what follows as a doubt followed up by
investigation, it appears to me, that the space which each
prismatic primary colour (as it is called) takes in the prismatic
ipecirum, has not one only angle of refraction within its ex
tent, but a successive series of angles of refraction, and a fuc-
reflive series * of innumerable circular or orbicular images of
the fun (ts Sir Isaac Newton states the fact), so closely lnter-

 secting each oilier, that the point of intersection is hardly
 perceptible to a common eye unassisted, if at all. Although,
 therefore, the centres of these circles may approach to each
other at an infinitely small distance; yet they are placed under
different refractions, and must, of course, give a succeeding
 tint more refracted than the preceding : and as thus through
 out the space of the comujonly called homogeneous colour, so
 must the indiscriminate series of refractions, and of the inter
 secting images of the fun, proceed gradatim, and not per
faltum, into the next space ot the next primary colour; and
so through that into the next ; and in like manner throughou
 the whole.     The angle of refraction at the point where the
 space in the spectrum, which contains the red, is supposed to
 end, exceeds that which is on the outside of the fame space,
 where it commences, in a much greater degree than it doth the
next contiguous and continuous series of angles of refraction of
 the space which contains the orange. And the fame holds good
 of the last angle of refraction at the point where the orange
 ends, or is supposed to end, and where the yellow com
 mences, or is supposed to commence ; and so through all the
 gradations of colours.        Sir Isaac Newton, in the hypothesis
 of his theorem instituted son experiment, so states it. As
 therefore the angles of refraction at the centres of the innu
 merable * circles or orbicular images of the fun in the pris
matic; spectrum, as stated by Sir Isaac Newton, which form
 any one of the principal colours, homogeneous as they have
 been called, thus differ in their degrees, so must the tints in
 each such colour differ in a series of gradations ; and cannot
 therefore, however they may to a transient or undiferimi-
 nating view appear, be absolutely homogeneous :
                                                                  " for, the
 light which I here call homogeneous (fays Sir Isaac Newton)
 being not homogeneal, there ought to arise some little change
 of colours from its heterogeneity f." The red, by such a suc
 cessive series of tints, is heightened towards and expanded
 into the orange; the orange, by a like succession of tints, into
 the yellow ; and the yellow, in like manner, into the white.
    As these coloured lights on this end of the spectrum
 heighten by gradations of tints more and more illumined,
 as if purging themselves from the suffusion of colour into
 pure light : so the blues at the other end of the spectrum, by
 a like gradation of tints, or rather hues, deeper and deeper,
 weaker and weaker, go off into darkness, in " a continued
 series, according to their degree of refrangibility J."

give  an  account  of some   of  these   experiments,     and  also of
the properties ascribed to his cobaltic acid.
    Having suffered zaffer to remain some time with ammonia,
after    few days digestion in the fun, he obtained

obtained appeared to him to be composed of two distinct sub
stances; one of dark red, and the other of pale yellowish

colour.    The red part dissolved in water, and the yellowish
remained in the filter. This residuum he found to be pure
oxide of cobalt. The part soluble in water was evaporated,
and deposited, on cooling, some small crystals, which Bru-
guatelli found to be      combination of the new cobaltic acid
                           a

evident character of acidity.
    The author observes, that his acid could be obtained co

to obtain it.    When the evaporations are effected            means    by

 This crystallization was permanent until the fun had again

                           a

tion, became turbid.        then continued till there remained only
                             I
about     ahectogramme of the liquor.            By cooling    obtained  I
a   crystallization in needles.      Having filtered the mixtures,
 stirring them, the crystals remained on the filter, and the su
pernatant liquor pasted through, very transparent, of bright                 a
yellow colour.       Brugnatelli, in making this experiment, did
 not remark the crystallization          he only observed
                                               ;                  white      a

 with the air, and which he found to be oxide of cobalt. The
 needle-formed crystallization which            obtained produced, as

                                          it
 cobalt, and not pure oxide, as had been announced.         The
 fact    of little importance, no doubt, in regard to the dis
         is

                                 ;        it
 nion,    ifthe results of my experiments were not more than
 sufficient to prove that the cobaltic acid does not exist.
    The liquors of the first, second, and third experiments,
 found to be acid, and of the fame nature, were subjected to
 the following proofs, and comparatively with the arsenic acid:
    ist, This liquor was precipitated of yellow colour, likea
 that of orpiment or sulphuret of arsenic,     sulphurated      by                hy
 drogen and alkaline hydrosulphurets.      This precipitate was
 indeed sulphuret of arsenic, and not sulphur precipitated, as
 believed          by
              Brugnatelli.

5*             New      Combination   discovered hi Zaffer i
 . his property is that of the arsenic acid.      This combination
is known under the name of arseniate of copper.
    3d, Sulphate of copper mixed with this liquor gives a pre
cipitate of the fame colour as the ammoniure of that metal.
The arsenious acid possesses this property also, though not in
so high a degree as the pretended cobaltic acid ; but a similar
precipitate may be obtained by making use of artificial arseni
ate of cobalt.       The results then are the fame : no difference
can be perceived between them.
    4th, It precipitates nitrate of silver white.        The arsenic
acid possesses this property.
    5th, It precipitates nitrate of mercury of a straw colour.
 It is well known that the arsenic acid exhibits the fame phæ-
nomenori.
    6th, It precipitates lime water in a white coagulum in
soluble in water, but not insoluble in excess of acid, as Bru-
gnatclli fays; since      it,
                           indeed, redissolves with the fame facility
in the pretended cobaltic acid as in the arsenic acid. The
error of Brugnatelli, in my opinion, arose from his not having
employed       asufficient quantity of acid.
    7th,  It  precipitates acetite and muriate of barytes.        I as
sured myself that this precipitation arose from some atoms of
sulphuric acid contained in the acid called cobaltic.             The
arseniate of cobalt also disguises its solutions.
    8th, With tinclure of galls newly made           forms an abun
                                                         it

                                           is
acid produces the fame phænomenon.
    9th, This last experiment seems to have been considered
by    Brugnatelli as the most characteristic of his cobaltic acid:
he observed that alcohol separated his solution from its aque
ous solution, and the arsenic acid, dissolved in alcohol, pos
sessed the lame property        bv these processes he oblained his
                                :

astonished me       ;but, presuming that     might find an explana

     I.  When heated on charcoal at the flame of the blowpipe
it  emitted white vapours, which were evidently arsenic.
     II.  A  small portion, heated with borax, communicated to
it   a violet colour.
     III. This acid, being precipitated onlv             by

water.

   V. When mixed with some drops of arsenic acid, it dis
solved completely, and reappeared with its first properties.
   After these trials I concluded that the acid of Brugnatelli
could be only arseniateof cobalt dissolved in excess of acid.
   To   ascertain          this,   I dissolved pure oxide of cobalt in arsenic
acid.       I   evaporated         the solution to dryness, and added to tho
residuum   distilled water. After stirring the mixture, it was
filtered.  The liquid obtained had a light rose colour, and
possessed all the properties of the cobaltic acid.
   This liquor, mixed with alcohol, was abundantly precipi
tated : this precipitate, when collected, exhibited all the phæ-
nomena observed in concrete cobaltic acid.
   It appears then certain, from the results here given, that
no cobaltic acid exists : that the combination of the arsenic
acid and the oxide of cobalt led Brugnatelli into an error,
since it is this combination with excess of acid that is ex
tracted from zaffer by the means described in that memoir.

 X HE         crystallizable quality of lime was first discovered by
Schaub. Bucholz obtained also very beautiful crystals of this
earth by boiling it with its muriate.          I have verified this dis
covery,   and   have  found   that crystallized lime may be obtained
as  well   in winter   as in summer,     only that the salt prepared
during    the  former   season  is in larger and longer crystals.     To
obtain these crystals, boil any quantity, at pleasure, of muriate
of lime with a fourth part, or less, of caustic lime, and con
centrate        it,
                  in winter, till
                      if              drop of the ley, made to fall
                                           a
on  a   cold stone, assumes the consistence of syrup without
crystallizing or becoming fixed.             The matter         then to  is
be filtered through          piece a of  close  cloth  extended    above
an earthen or porcelain capsule, which must be covered aster
filtration       bysimilar capsule or wooden lid, in order that
                      a                         a
the matter may cool as slowly as possible.             In this manner
may     be   obtained    very long    but   very  sine crystals of lime,
which       it   necessary to wash in alcohol in order to free
                  is
them from the adhering muriate.             This operation cannot be
undertaken with less than some pounds of the muriate of
lime.       It   well known that, when muriate of ammonia
                 is                                                                  is

    As these elements, however, did not acfree with other ob
 servations, I    tried another parabola combining other observa
 tions, and experienced the fame difficulties. Reflecting after
 wards, that to make the two observations, that of the lit of
January and that of the nth of February, agree,                   was ne   it
 cessary to suppose 0*26 of difference between the radius vector
corresponding to the first, and the other corresponding to the

  56                  Result   of  the Observations
  second,   I described mechanically my first parabola ; and ap
  plying  to   it the longitudes and latitudes thus calculated and
  observed,   it was easy for me to ascertain that the motion of
 this star could not, indeed, be represented in the arc of a pa
 rabola such as is nearly described by comets.
     III. From parabolic hypotheses I proceeded to circular,
 and, having made a few suppositions, I found two radii, viz.
  27067 and 2-6862, with each of which tlie observations
 could be represented much better than with any parabola;
 for, as the planets describe ellipses more or less eccentric,
 and not circles, it is to be supposed that our planet will not
 deviate from this law.       I ought therefore to have continued
 my calculations on an ellipsis ; but as the observed arc was
 very small, the results would have been uncertain, and the
 labour tedious and painful.         On this account I preferred the
 circle, especially as the elements obtained from the ellipse to
 determine the place of this star do not appear to me to be
more certain than those afforded by the circle.
     IV. On the 10th of January the star, from being retro-
   rade, became direct.       Setting out, therefore, from the ob-
kervations of this day, I endeavoured to find its elongation
while stationary, which was 4' 40; whence we have for mean
radius of its orbit 2-9352.          But the difference between this
radius and the other, obtained by the motion of the star be
tween the 1st of January and the nth of February, seems to
indicate a great eccentricity, whereas the series of the ob
servations leems rather to indicate that the eccentricity ought
to be small : on the other hand, the diameter, deduced from
the elongation of a planet while stationary, can never be very
exact, and particularly in the present case.
    V. During the first observations, bringing the star under
the horizontal thread of the telescope, it remained, as it
were, entirely covered; and, as the thread subtends to the
eye an angle of about 6", I judged the diameter of the star
to be somewhat greater, that is to fay, 7".            During the last
observations I was not able to form any judgment of its dia
meter, on account of the darkened state of the atmosphere.

         IX.  The correspondence of the observed longitudes of this
     star with those calculated   according to the circular hypothesis;
     its motion in the zodiac, from which it deviates only a little
     in its greatest latitudes; and its position between Mars and
     Jupiter ; seem to leave no doubt that it is a real planet, and,
     in all probability, the very fame deduced from calculation in
     the year 1772 by professor Bode, and announced to the Aca
     demy of Sciences of Berlin. That it was not then observed,
     though the zodiac was diligently examined by the best astro
     nomers, ought to be ascribed chiefly, in my opinion, to its
     smallness compared with its distance from the earth and with
     its greatest latitudes ; though it is not improbable that it was
     seen by the abbe De la Caille or Tobias Meyer.                  In the ca
     talogues of the stars made by these two astronomers there
     are iome observed only once ; which I have not been able to
     find, though I searched for them repeatedly and at different
     times.     If the original observations of Meyer are preserved
     at Gottingen, and those of the abbe De la Caille at Paris,
      they may possibly be yet discovered.          In the end of my work
      on the position of the fixed (tars, the printing of which,
      through the munificence of our gracious sovereign, is already
      far advanced, there will be given a catalogue of the lost
      stars, by which this research will be greatly facilitated.

    X. Tt is the opinion of many astronomers, and I am in
clined to agree with them, that there are several other pla
nets of the like kind still undiscovered.             But as astronomers
either seldom observe stars beyond the 7th magnitude, or are
satisfied with observing them once, or at most twice, there
is reason to doubt whether theie planets will be easily disco
vered.    Had I not been accustomed to observe stars four,
five,  or  fix times, and even more, I should certainly not
have discovered the one in question.              Re-examining, as was
the cafe, after a long time, the observations of the 1st and
2d of January, and finding that they did not agree, I should
have searched in the same place of the heavens for this new-
star, and, not finding           it,should have classed      itamong the
number of the doubtful ones;                thing
                                            a        Ihave  been  loo often
obliged    to  do  with     others,   the   observations   of which   I was
prevented    from  continuing          by
                                        the  inclemency    of the  weather.
    XI. Oriani, Rode, and Von Zach, had scarcely seen the
observations of the 1st and 23d of January, which                 commu
                                                                  I
nicated to them on the 24th, adding at the fame time that
on the 10th the star from being retrograde had become direct,
when they were of opinion that                  itwas    new planet; and
                                                         a
they   next   concluded     that its  elements    were  the  fame as those
which  I    had conjectured. But as the star after the 23d began
 to decrease sensibly     in  magnitude and in light, being uncer
 tain whether this ought to be ascribed to its receding rapidly
from the earth, or rather to the state of the atmosphere,
 which after that period became more overcast and obscure                     ;
I  began to entertain some doubts respecting its nature, and
 to believe that,    in all probability,         was
                                                it      comet and not
                                                         a                    a
planet.    It  was only         by
                                 calculating all the observations that
 my doubts were at length dissipated but, on account of other
                                                ;
 avocations and the bad state of my health,                  Iwas not then
 able to pay proper attention to them.             Finding myself some
 what better in April,     I   resolved to calculate my observations;
 but having brought on          asecond indisposition while fixing the
 meridian of the metropolitan church, and being reduced to
a  weaker state than before            ;being uncertain at what time         I
 should be able to resume my studies, and anxious to com
 municate my observations to the above-mentioned meritorious
 astronomers,   I   transmitted them to Lalande at Paris, Oriani
 at Milan, and Bode at Berlin.              As yet, however,      I have re
 ceived no answer but from Bode, who, on seeing my further
 observations,  is  more and more confirmed in his first opinion,
 and only seems      a little surprised that, as was much inclined
                                                     I
in   my first letter to Oriani to consider my new star as planet,     a
                                                                  I       should

60                        Result   of      the Observations
I   should  afterwards have considered it rather to be a comet.
But    had    I
              communicated to him also the circumstance re
 specting  the  diminution of its light, he would, perhaps, have
entertained some doubts of the lame kind.
    XII. As this star has not been lately seen, some doubt will
remain in regard to its nature; and it may be difficult to
discover it again on account of the uncertainty of the ele
ments of the orbit which it describes, and more particularly
its very small size.     At present it remains above our horizon
the greater part of the night, being in the sign of Cancer;
but it is at too considerable a distance for me to hope that                            I
shall be able to distinguish it : and, on the other hand, I am
destitute of the instruments necessary to search for        with any     it,
certainty, out of the meridian.       About the beginning of No
vember     itwill be much easier to discover         and as the first

days of March, the time of its opposition, will be the most
convenient period for observing        with advantage,

   The difference of the three parabolas calculated by Oriani,
Mr.           , and myself, none of which represent all the
observations,   confirm still more that the motion of this star
cannot indeed be represented in a parabolic arc, as I have

 out, in the few leaves printed in German with which Oriani
 favoured me, suspected that there might have been some error
 in the copy of my observations transmitted to him. This
 was really the cafe in the first; but afterwards sent another

 may be, and to leave no doubt in regard to the observations
 I   have again examined them ; and in some places which
 were rather uncertain, and which I employed               in my first
calculations, I substituted others. I have also made an al
 lowance for the deviation of the instruments, and em
ployed all those precautions which are usual when great
precision is required. The result of all these has been only
 a small difference in some of the right ascensions, which
 can have little or no influence on the ultimate results of
 the calculation, and for which reason I did not think
great exactness necessary in the first reductions.             Accord
ing to this last rigorous examination, i'5" are to be de
 ducted from the first four right ascensions, and 1-5" to be
 added to those of the 10th, nth, 14th, 19th, aist, 23d,
28th, 30th, and 31st of January, and the lit of February;

bruary.       With the transit instrument the observations were
made, different times, with all the five threads ; and these          I
always preferred to those made with the circle.           I used those
by the circle when I failed with the transit instrument ; as
on the first four days; and on the 13th of January, when the
observations were not made with all the five threads,           I took
a mean of the observations made with the circle, and another
¦of those made       with the transit instrument.       The difference
between those with the former instrument and those with the
latter, was never greater than o'% in time, except on the
19th of January, when I found 1" in time more by the
circle.     In regard to the declinations, I have found no cor
rections to be made.          Should any astronomer, for his greater
satisfaction, be desirous to fee the original observations, I
mail be happy to communicate them to him.                They will be
published in the sixth book of the Specola AJlronomica, toge
ther with all my other observations made since 1794.

  A          existence of a primary planet/which, on account of
the faintness of its lio-htand small size has hitherto remained
undiscovered,       was, as far as I know, first conjectured, or at

mortal Lambert.      In his Cofmological                    Letters on the Uni
verse, which appeared at Augsburg in 1761 *, the following
remarkable passage occurs towards the end of the first letter :
"  And who knows whether some planets may not be lost,
from the wide space between Mars and Jupiter ?" This idea
was no doubt suggested to Lambert by comparing the dif
ferent distances or the planets; and he must soon have found
that the distance between Mars and Jupiter is too great in
proportion to the rest.    To fill up this vacancy he placed in
it a new primary planet ; and as it had not been observed
during the course of two centuries, that        since the invenis,
tion of the telescope, he supposes      to have been torn from'

    This law is founded on no known theory, at least it has
 never yet been demonstrated mathematical 'lj, and is merely
deduced empirically from analogical conclusions.                 In no sci
 ence have the powers of the human mind, merely by mathe
matical reasoning and the acuteness of geometrical reflection,
produced so many, so certain, and so pure truths as in astro
nomy.        When w<J consider the immensity and exalted nature
of the objects on which this science is employed, and the
insignificance of man and his terrestrial habitation, together
with the endless variety and concatenation of the celestial
phænomena, which all take place in consequence of one
general very simple law of nature, that of gravity, diffused
throughout the whole creation ; and when we reflect what
abstruse mathematical formulæ and methods must be invented
to subject these so variously combined phænomena to cal
culation, and to obtain a uniform and continual correspond
ence of these calculations with what actually takes place in
the heavens, it must be acknowledged, that no science does
more honour to the human genius ; that in no science have
more discoveries been made a priori; and that no science is
founded on more incontrovertible proofs than the exalted
science    of astronomyf      .
    The mathematical          astronomers,    for there are some who
are   not  so, do not readily adopt any thing that cannot be
mathematically proved.             However great, therefore, might be
the probability      that   the   above- mentioned relation, in regard
to the distances of the planets, taking it at least as an ap
proximation, existed in nature, there were astronomers who
doubted the consequences of this undemonstrated                    law, and
the existence     of  an  invisible planet between     Mars    and Jupiter.

    It is worthy of remark, that the astronomers of no nation
but Germany adopted this conjecture in their astronomical
books, or wrote any thing on the subject.          How is this to
be accounted for?        Does the spirit of an eminent German,
the spirit of a Kepler, still hover over Germany ? I do not
here mean to assert that the Germans believed uncondition
ally in the existence of this planet, or acknowledged it ad
proved.      Professor Bode has mentioned it in all his valuable
works on astronomy, and in all the editions of them published
since 1772 ; but he always speaks of its existence as founded
on conjecture or analogy, and not as a demonstrated truth.
    About sixteen years ago I employed myself in analogical
calculations of the elements of the orbit of this latent planet,
as may be seen by the letters I wrote to professor Bode from
Dresden, in September 1785, which were printed in the Berlin
Astronomical Almanac for 1780.          But I spoke of these re
searches as mere dreams, and called my calculations chimerical.
 I even ridiculed them, and compared them to the researches
of the adepts who endeavour to find the art of gold-making.
In the year 1798, when, in consequence of Lalande's visit
to Gotha, I had the pleasure of seeing my highly esteemed
friend Bode, this subject formed part of our conversation.
That worthy veteran Lalande had no great faith in the exist
ence of this planet ; he has not said a word of it in any of
 the three editions of his Astronomy which have been pub
 lished : and I used to call those who entertained a strong belief
of its existence, ajlronomical adepts.
     In the year 1787 professor Wurm was engaged with simi
lar thoughts on the possibility of other planets and comets
existing in our system.      These ideas he communicated to the
public    in  the Berlin Astronomical  Almanac for 1790, and in
that of the following year, where he extended them to the
system of the satellites.      But he observed at the same time,
that he was far from wishing to make any one adopt his
 astronomical visions, as he expressly terms them.
     Astronomers had the greater reason for being on their guard
against analogical conclusions, as the remarkable instance of
our great master may serve to show that too much confidence
must not be placed in a lively imagination.         Poets may be
allowed some latitude in this respect ; but we must refuse the
 fame indulgence to a certain class of naturalists and philoso
 phers, who think they can catch nature in the slippery paths
of mysticism ; who substitute an unintelligible jargon for a
 language generally understood ; and who attempt to explain
  a difficulty by obscurity.
      Kepler, who often indulged in such astronomical dreams,
       Vol. XII.                    E                         and

66                    RefleQions       on the   new Planet,
and gave full scope to his ardent imagination, thought he had
made   a great discovery bv supposing    that the five regular
bodies would fit exactly into the vacuity between the six
planets known at that time ; and their distances indeed, ac
cording to the latest observations, correspond very well with
this rule.   But unfortunately, as has been remarked by pro
fessor    Wurm, Euclid and Nature left no regular, body for
 Uranus ; and I may add, that none remains for Hera : so
 that Kepler's ingemous idea falls at once to the ground.
     Should the question proposed on the discovery of Uranus
 be here asked —Why was not this planet discovered long
 ago ? we might give the same answer to it as given by Lich-
 lenberg        who considered
              *",                      of the fame kind as that of

 Lelio's    servant   in  Lesfing's Treasure, who wished to know
'why    his  father  had  returned on     certain day, and not
                                             a                     year           a
 sooner or later     ; which he thought would have been much
 less incomprehensible.
     The most natural way            is,
                                    as professor Bode has done      his               in
 Illustration of Astronomy, to conjecture that this planet,
 being smaller than Mars, and at considerable distance beyond
                                             a
it,   reflects too little light from its surface      and hence
                                                           ;        has               it
 escaped    the  keenest-sighted   observers.    But  who   knows  what
 the nature of its surface may be             We are acquainted with
                                                 ?
 celestial bodies which exhibit different colours, shades of red
 and green      ;as for example Mars, and the double star             in                y
 Andromeda, the light of which increases and decreases and                        ;
 others which even disappear from our view.
     Kant and Wunsch, in their Cosmological papers, assert
 therefore that this planet does not exist by itself, but that                              it
is   incorporated with Jupiter; which             therefore of greater
                                                      is
 size than    itought to be according to the supposed rule, and con
 sequently supplies the place of two planets.         Kant ascribes the
 small size of Mars, and its want of satellites, to the fame cause.
 But this hypothesis was not necessary to explain the invisibility
 of this planet, as       can be done in a much better manner, and
                         it
 more agreeable to the laws of nature. How Jong did Uranus
 remain concealed from our fight              And yet

possibility of the discovery of a satellite and of such a planet.
Jt is possible that this planet, as was the cafe with Uranus,
may have been seen several times ; but it is also possible that
it is not always visible.          For, since it appears only as a tele
scopic star during the time of its nearest approach to the earth,
at its greater/ distance from us it may escape the best instru
ments and disappear entirely ; which renders the finding of it
still more difficult and uncertain.
    All these impediments might in part have been foreseen ;
and it was only by an accident, or systematic regulation, that
the discovery of this planet amongst the immense number of
telescopic stars was possible.           In the year 1787, when I un
dertook, at Gotha, a new revision of the starry heavens, my
view was to search for this planet, to which I was particu
larly encouraged by the august founder of the observatory of
Gotha. I therefore confined myself merely to the zodiacal
stars, and made a catalogue containing the right ascension of
these stars, under a conviction that it was possible by these
means alone to fall upon this concealed planet.
    In the autumn of last year, when I had the pleasure of
undertaking a sliort astronomical tour to Celle, Bremen, and
Lilicnthal, and of spending a few agreeable weeks in the
company of some of the ablest German astronomers, these

 eminent men were of opinion that it was not possible for one
 or two astronomers to examine all the telescopic stars of the
whole zodiac in search of this concealed planet. Six astro
nomers then assembled at Lilicnthal resolved therefore, on
the aist of September 1800, to establish a society of twenty-
four practical astronomers dispersed throughout different parts
of Europe, for the express purpose of searching out this planet
supposed     to exist between      Mars and Jupiter. They elected
Mr. Schroter         as their president; and I had the honour of
being chosen their perpetual secretary.            The plan of the so
ciety  was   to  divide   the whole   zodiac    among the twenty-four
members, each of whom was to have assigned to him, by
lot, a zone of 150 of longitude, and of from 7 to 8° of north
and south latitude.         Eacli member was to construct a new
celestial chart of his department, comprehending the smallest
 stars, and, by repeated examination of the heavens, lo ascer
tain the true state of his district, and whether it contained
that wandering body.             By this institution we entertained
hopes that this star, which had so long eluded our researches,
would be at length traced out.               In the name of the society
I  wrote to several of the most celebrated practical astronomers,
in Europe, inviting them to concur in this general object ;
and almost all of them agreed to the invitation with great
readiness*. Some of the members, who have already begun
their labours with great diligence, have transmitted, for our
inspe6tion, very interesting information ; and though our
infant society may be deprived of the honour of first discover
ing this planet, not only is the supposed discoverer of it
among the number of its members, though the uncertain
state of conveyance by post or bv sea, in consequence of the
war, has hitherto prevented us from transmitting our invita
tion to Palermo, but the society has already contributed a
great deal, and will still contribute more, towards correcting
our catalogues of the stars : and as this is not the only ob-
"ect of the society in the extensive province of astronomy, its
tabours, by being continued, must be of considerable utility.
    In the month of February, this year (1801), I received a
letter from Lalande at Paris, in which he informed me, that
 Piazzi, astronomer at Palermo, had discovered, on the 1st of
January, a small comet in the shoulder of Taurus; it appear-
   * The only astronomers who 6egg;d to be excused were professor Snia-
devki of Cracow, End processor Wurm of Blaubeuern.         The former, be
cause, the university of Cracow being suppressed, he was consequently
obliged to leave the observatory : the latter, on account of the want of in
struments. But this difficulty was removed by princely munificence. The
duke of Gntha sent professor Wurm a 7 feet reflector by Herichel, and
the duchess aa asiionomical clock.
                                                                         ed

 this supposed comet ; and I immediately wrote to him to send
 me the sequel of his observations.     In the mean time I can
not help mentioning that I have found, by a well-known and
 easy calculation, that the two observations of the ist and 23d
 of January, and the stationary state of the star on the nth
 of the fame month, agree excellently with the supposition
 that it is not a comet, but perhaps the hitherto unknown
 planet between Mars and Jupiter, taking its distance at from
 3-75 to 2'8o. What do you fay of it? It is much to be
 regretted that we have not a third observation.      But, as the
 stationary state agrees very well with the given places, it has
 become to me a matter of great importance.        Send me a few
 words by the next post respecting your opinion. I may err,
and wish for information; but the correspondence is very
remarkable.      Do you know any more observations respecting
this singular comet ?"
    On reading this letter, I immediately had recourse to my
old calculations of the years 1784 and 1785, and sliowed to pro
fessor Pasquich, who was present when I received the letter, that
my elements of the orbit of this planet, calculated from analogy
in the year 1785, and inserted in the Berlin Astronomical Al
manac for 1789, gave as its distance from the fun 2-82, and
as its period of revolution 4*74 years, or 4 years 9 months.
Professor Bode, from Piazzi's observations, had found the di
stance 2*75, and the revolution the fame as I had deduced from
analogy, viz. 4 years 9 months. I immediately sent an ansvver
to professor Bode's letter, and informed him, that my two ele
ments of the orbit of this so long concealed planet, calcu
lated, provisionally, sixteen years before, amidst my analogical
dreams, and which I had deposited in his hands in a sealed

note in October 1785 *, when I had the pleasure of forming
a personal acquaintance with this worthy friend at Berlin,
corresponded      perfectly with his own, and consequently with
those of Piazzi.       I was therefore not only of opinion ~that
the supposed comet might be the invisible planet so long
sought    for in vain, but found that Oriani of Milan, from
whom I      received a letter two days after, entertained the fame
opinion, that this star was the planet supposed to exist be
tween Mars and Jupiter.            Piazzi himself, even in January,
 (Piazzi's   letter to  Oriani is  dated   on the fame day as that to
Bode, viz. the 24th,) informed Oriani that he considered this
star, which he first supposed to be a comet, as a real planet.
The honour, therefore, not only of having first discovered this
star, but that also of having first ascertained it to be a planet,
cannot be refused to Piazzi ; and one might almost suspect
 (though we can hardly' ascribe such a motive to him) that he
wished to retain to himself likewise the honour of having first
calculated its orbit, as he communicated his observations in
so sparing and imperfect a manner.
    Professor Bode announced this discovery and conjecture to
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and caused it to
 be published in the Berlin Gazette of May 12, the Jena Lite
rary Gazette of May 6, and in the Hamburgh paper of the
 13th, from which it was copied into other journals.
    Two days after I received professor Bode's letter, and before
 I could return an answer I received one from Oriani, dated
 April 7, in which he says : " I have received a letter from
 Piazzi at Palermo, which contains information highly worthy
 of your attention and of all astronomers.         He writes me, that
 on the 1st of January 1801 he had observed a star, of the 8th
 or 9th magnitude, in the shoulder of Taurus.               On the 2d
 of January he found this star had advanced about 3' 30"
 further towards the north, and about 4 min. towards o Aries.
 The two following day;, the 3d and 4th, he found nearly
 the fame motion.        On the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, the
 heavens were so obscured that he could make no observation.
 On the 10th and nth he again saw the star; and afterwards
 on the 13th, 14th, 17th, i8th, 19th, 21st, 22d, and 23d of
 January.      From the 10th to the nth its motion, from being
 retrograde,     had become direct.         He adds, that on the first

I supposed, most be improper for representing its motion and
geocentric place after so long a period : we must therefore
wait for the remainder of Piazzi's observations, which he no%
doubt has continued. The heavens with us, since the receipt
of Piazzi's letter, have been always overcast : you, perhaps,
have a sky more favourable for astronomical observations
than oursf- In this persuasion, I send you my elements of the

rays and the vapour of the horizon.            I afterwards found that
Oriani, in consequence of his great haste and anxiety to com
municate to me the intelligence as soon as possible, must have
committed an error in the calculation of these preliminary
elements, particularly iu the Q , and in the inclination of the
orbit.     But even had there been no error I should not have
found this small wandering star; for when I received the in
formation the obscurity was too great, and the star too near
the horizon.       Professor Bode also, as he informed me in a
letter dated May 12, had searched for it several evenings, but
in vain.
    As no hope now remained of being able to observe this
singular and remarkable body till its return from the fun in
August or September, I made a calculation of its orbit as
well as possible from so imperfect and scanty observations;
not with a view of finding it again in the course of two or
 three months (for before that time I hoped Piazzi, by con
tinuing his observations, would give us better and more deter
minate data and conclusions), but merely that I might have
 by me some conjectures to enable me with better grounds to
 believe in the actual existence of a planet between Mars and
 Jupiter.
     The observations     given by Piazzi for calculating         the orbit
 are partly imperfect and partly insufficient,              lit, His two
 observations     which are known, are only for minutes, and
 announced as nearly,           ad, For calculating the orbit of a
 planet or a comet, three observations at least are necessary,
 3d, The times of the observations are not assigned. In regard
 to the first, we may admit, that at least the nearest minutes
  of  the observation    are given right.       In regard to the second
  difficulty, Piazzi perhaps, as already said, may have purposely
  withheld the third observation,          that he might calculate first
  himself the orbit of this planet * ; for he considered it as such
  before the 24th of January.         But if this were the cafe, he
  betrayed, in some measure, his having made a third observa
  tion; as he mentions that the planet from the 10th to the
  nth of January was stationary. Oriani and Bode took ad
  vantage of this circumstance, and I employed it myself to
  calculate an approximate orbit of this planet from these
  scanty observations.        The third difficulty was obviated by
  the following conjectures :
      Piazzi, as is well known, is employed in the construction
     • The celebrated
                         French astronomer J. N. tie Tide went still further.
  Having diliovcrtd, at the observatory os' Paris, the long announced, lone;
  expttted coma of 1750, he kipt it a long time secret, observed it in pri
  vate, and ordered his pupil Messier to lay nothing of his discovery.
                                                                          of

fortune which I hoped to enjoy while preparing my catalogue
of the stars, and with the view of which the Lilienthal Astro
nomical Society was formed ; and the planet would certainly
not have escaped them, even if it had not been discovered by
Piazzi +. Piazzi is furnished at his observatory with an ex
cellent transit instrument, and a complete meridian circle by
Ramsden, by means of which he no doubt fell upon this small
wandering star. This star must have culminated on the ist
of January, the day when discovered, about nine in the even
ing. At that time of the year and hour it is perfect night
at Palermo ; and therefore Piazzi could very well observe this
small star, of the 8th or ninth magnitude, with a day tele
scope.      It was, however, full moon ; and as the moon had
risen three hours above the horizon of Palermo, the night
must have been very bright.                 But the moon was four hours,
or about 68° distant from the star ; and this circumstance
alone converts my conjecture into certainty, that Piazzi must
have found this supposed comet not with a comet-searcher,
but with his meridian instrument.                     The above-mentioned
right    ascensions    of   the    wandering     star,   converted into time,
were consequently the time of its culmination in sidereal
time : these I again converted into mean solar time, and
thus brought out the true moments of the observations of
the star.       By these, and the obliquity of the ecliptic 230 28'
 io", I have obtained the following data for calculating the
 orbit :

    As the star on the 10th of January became stationary,                           I
 found its elongation for that time 7s 260 41' 41", and, by
 means of Keil's proposition, that the tangent of the elonga
 tion is equal to the semidiameter of the orbit divided by the
 square root of that semidiameter, + 1. I found this semi-
 diameter = 3*071, and, by Kepler's principle, the revolution
    *  Last year lie published his large catalogue, comprehending 5500 stars.
    +   It was really fortunate that Piazzi discovered his star on this day ;
 for, had he fallen upon it eight days later, it is possible it might have
 escaped him ; for, as this wandering star about that time became stationary,
 he would not, from the observations of next day, have remarked its
 motion.    It is very singular that this new planet, if its being such be really
 confirmed, was discovered and seen in the shoulder of Taurus, as Uranus
  was 20 and no years ago.

  the following approximate elements of the orbit :

     Those who attentively consider and compare these elements
 will no doubt remark, that the distance and periodical time
 of Piazzi's star are exactly the fame as those of the celebrated
 comet of 1770, the calculation of which gave so much em
 ployment to astronomers, and the orbit of which Lexel could
 no otherwise represent than in an ellipse of 5 j- years. Pingre
 also found its distance — 3*09, and the period of revolu
 tion 5-4 years *. Burckhardt, who lately obtained the se
 cond prize proposed on this subject by the National Institute,
 could not reduce this singular body from new observations
 into any other than an elliptical orbit of 5^ years.              Was the
 comet of 1770 the so long concealed planet ? or was Piazzi's
star the comet of 1770?           In either cafe, whether it was a
 comet or planet, Why was it not oftener seen, or before
discovered ?      The causes, some of which we have already
mentioned, may have been various.                But to confine myself
to a probable W3y of explaining this point, let the reader only
 look into Schroter's Observations on the Comet of 1799,
 publisoed in the third volume of his Collections in regard to
the latest Astronomical Discoveries f. The most singular phæ-
nomena of the aecidental variable modifications of the ne
bulous light surrounding the comet, and also the well-known
atmospheres of the planets, and even the fun, will be found
there explained.         In the nebulous light which surrounded
the comet of 1799, Mr. Schroter observed not only occa
sional, but sudden and disproportionably great changes both
in the extent and strength of the photosphere.                Dr. Flerschel
not long ago presentees to the Royal Society a paper on the
structure ot the sun, in which this eminent astronomer ex
plains the solar spots by supposing an elastic and not lumi
nous gas disengaged from the opake surface of the sun's body,
which divides the surrounding luminous fluid or photosphere,
by which means we then fee dark parts of the body, which
we consider as spots.

in 1604 in the foot of Serpentarius, which seemed at one
time so bright that it exceeded in splendour stars of the first
magnitude, became invisible next year, and has never since
appeared ? What are Herschel's planetary nebulae ? Did not
Schroter % find that whole tracts of luminous nebulae disap
peared from the heavens?       What are our large fire-balls,
which move with a velocity a hundred times greater perhaps
than that of a cannon bullet, emit a bright light, burst, and
then disappear ? It is proved that they are bodies belonging
to the universe, and not to our atmosphere.         This was the
opinion of Montanari§ in 1676, who, in his Fiamma vo
latile   calculates that one of these fire-balls, seen throughout
       ||,
all Italy in the above year, was at the height of forty Italian
miles.    All our readers must remember the large sire-ball
seen in the year 1783 in every part of Europe, and pretty
well observed. It was calculated         by
                                      some of the English astro
nomers that the height of this immense body of fire was 60
English miles, and that its greatest diameter was l^th mile.

others dark        ?    The comet of 1770, therefore, might exist
sometimes in an opake, and sometimes in a phosphorescent
Hate ; and hence perhaps, and from the perturbative power
of the larsrer and more dense bodies, the unfrequency of their
 return may be explained. They come back, and we do not
fee them ; they are present, and we do not observe them.
To draw conclusions, from the identity of the elements of the
orbit of a body, respecting the identity of the body itself,
           as all astronomers        know, but a high degree of proba-
fives,
  ilify*, among the ninety-one comets, confirmed by only one
hypothesis t, which certainly may be true taken directly but
not inversely.          Two comets, however, whose orbits have not
the identical fame elements, may be one and the fame body.
This, as far as I know, has never been explicitly asserted by
any one: but Lexel mentioned it implicitly, when the fol
lowing objection was made to him on account of the five
years elliptical orbit of the comet of 1770 : Since the period
of the revolution of this comet is so short, why was it not
seen oftener, and long ago ?              Lexel was of opinion, and per
haps so was the great Euler his master, under whose inspec
tion he laboured, that the influence and perturbation of the
large body of Jupiter, to which this comet approached very
near on the 27th of May 1767, and the 23d of August 1779,
might        have entirely changed its orbit         J.   Burckhardt was
of   the fame opinion in his memoir written on the subject
of the prize already mentioned.
    But how frightful is the mere idea of calculating the per
turbation of such a body ! Would not such a calculation
exceed the powers of our analysis? The difficult theory of
the moon would be mere elementary calculation compared
with the variable orbit of such a body.              It were to be wished
that    so  striking a phænomenon would produce the necessity
of giving      to our calculation, in regard to perturbation, a new-
direction, that the theory of so complex an approximation
might be more improved, and that the influence of the suc-
ceslive integrations on neglected quantities might be better
and more accurately determined. But the geometrician, who
can represent all the co-ordinates of the motion of each ce
lestial body in speedily approximating series of fines and co
sines of the angle depending on its real motion, does not,
perhaps, exist on our earth.

     Many no doubt will consider the tail which, according to
  Mesfier's express observation *, attended the comet of 1770,
  as a proof that it could not be a planet.       But, is it proved
  that planets cannot have a tail ? We have planets with sa
  tellites, and others without these attendants ; why therefore
  should there not be planets with tails, to prove, in a visible
  manner, that they are nothing else than planets ? This dif
  ference in the appellation originated in the periods of igno
  rance, and must now be admitted into our language to di
  stinguish those bodies, the appearance of which is of shorter
 duration, and which do not remain visible throughout their
 whole orbits) from those which are always visible, except
 when they approach too near to the fun. The circumstance
which seems to be peculiar only to comets, that some of them
 move retrograde, while all the planets move direct, is only
 apparent. The reader is referred to the explanation which
Laplace and Lalande have given of this point in regard to
 the retrograde satellites of Uranus %. Lalande fays the word
retrograde imposes by its expression, but in reality is nothing.
 Kant, in his Allg. Nat. und Tbeorie des Himmels, original
edition, publistied in 1755, conjectured that the retrograde
 motion of some comets might be only an optical illusion,
 like that of the geocentric motion of the planets.
,    Every newly discovered object must have a new appella
 tion. Though a name in itself is of no great importance, we
 have seen in regard to Uranus how difficult it is for all man
 kind, from the Thames to the Neva, to be unanimous in
 this respect.    If the star lately discovered by Piazzi be really
the supposed plane I between Mars and Jupiter, a great and
august patron of astronomy, the founder of the observatory of
Seeberg, gave      it, in my opinion,        very appropriate name

 means the discovery made on that ifland, and the celebrated
 name of the discoverer of this eighth primary planet, will be
 eternized and preserved as long as tradition and history exist
 on the earth. The city of Hera, situated, as well as Pa
 lermo, on the coast of Sicily, was called also Hybla Minor,
 and  is  the fame mentioned          by
                                     Pausanias, Cicero in his Let
 ters to Atticus, and Antoninus in his Itinerary.             In the last
 place,   Hera   is the mother  of Vulcan,    who    has  his  workshop
 in the burning mountain of Ætna in that island.
    The objection already made in regard to Uranus, that all
 the planets have Roman and not Greek names, must be of
less importance, as the Greek name OCptu/ls has been retained
to that discovered        by
                          Herschel, though          would have been

                                                  is
time, may retain their Latin names; but the new planets,
the history of the discovery of which will be handed down to
the latest posterity, with the names of the discoverers, ought,
by way of distinction, to have Greek names. What seems
here an interruption of analogy will be only harmony. Since
the creation, like the Creator, has no bounds, should another
planet be discovered beyond Uranus, its hieroglyphic ap
pellation ought to be Greek.
    It will be necessary also to invent an appropriate character
for this planet. To new planet we mav assign the character
                             a
of new metal. This idea has been followed in regard to
  a
Uranus; but we have thereby committed an error, or rather
establistied a.monumentof our ignorance respecting the com
ponent parts of platina.           was     much better proposal to

                             POSTSCRIPT.
     While the last sheet of this paper was printing we received
 from our worthy friend Dr. Olbers, of Bremen, the following
 elements of the orbit of Hera, which he calculated in a circle
 from the observations communicated to him by Piazzi :
 Semidiameter of the orbit              -         -       a'95x
 Longitude     of  the  ascending   £3
                                               -     2' 21° 55'
 Inclination of     the orbit          -                   7   56
 Heliocent. long. Jan. 1st, 1801               -       a   7   45
 Sidereal revolution            -        185 16 days = 5*0694 years.
 Daily heliocent. motion               -         -        11' 39/95"
 Yearly    motion             -                              71° i'
     This orbit is very insufficient, as it is calculated on the hy
 pothesis of a circle : the very imperfect observations             were
 only 22 days distant from each other ; and, as Dr. Olbers
 very well observes, the lines of fight do not lie advantageously.
 Dr. Olbers is also of opinion that these elements are not suf
  ficient to calculate a planet so long before, in order to be able
  to find it again on its reappearance in the morning in August.
  In the month of August it will pass through the whole sign
 of Cancer, and must be sought for in the equinoctial point.
  From the 1st to the 31st of August, a zone of the heavens
  from 1150 to 130° of right ascension, and from 22° to 24P
  north declination, must be carefully searched ; for this will
  be the district of the heavens where the planet will, in all
  probability, be found in that month.
      In the oldest periods Latin verses have been invented to
  denote the order of the planets in regard to their distance
  from the fun. Thus, for example, we have the old well-
  known    verses  :
             Sarurni atque Jovis Sidui, Mars, Sol, Venus alma,
               Mercurius, claudit ultima Luna choruin.
      On the    discovery of Herschel's planet, Poinsinet de Sivry
   wished   to have it called Cybele or Cybelle, after the wife of
   Saturn, the nearest planet below it ; and expressed the order
   of the seven planets in the following three Latin verses :
           Ambit Solem Hermes, Venus hunc, mox Terra, Dhna,
           Mars sequitur. Pcrgit rex Jupiter. Hunc Saturnus.
           Omnes hos orbes amplectitur alma Cubelle.
                                                                     One

8o             Particulars respecting        the new        Planet.
   One of my friends, possessed of a poetical vein, has expressed
the order of the planets, now increased to eight, in the fol
lowing four lines, and not unhappily :
          Mercurius primus : Venus altera : Terra deinde,
          Mars posthac: quintam scdem sibi vindicat Hera.
          Jupittr hanc ultra est. Scquitur Saturnus : at ilium
          Uranus eyreditur, non ausim dicere summus.

   On the 7th of February and subsequent days, it was ob
served by Dr. Herschel at Slough, and also by Alex. Aubert,
esq. at his observatory at Highbury House.
   The state of the weather at Slough did not admit of Doctor
Herschel's seeing the new planet till Monday night the 8th
current, he having previously received distinct notice as to its
place from his friend Dr. Maskelyne, the astronomer royal,
who for the first time observed        like  it,
                                               star of the eighth

magnitude,    on  the 4th current,  in  the morning.      On the
9th and 10th of February at night, Dr. Herschel again traced
the planet, and perceived its motion.       was not however till

obstruction from the moon-light, lie obtained a distinct view
of it for a short time. Through his ten feet reflector, with
a niagnifving power of fix hundred, and higher powers, he
perceived its disc, though very small, yet distinctly round and
well defined; hut saw nothing further which denoted a ring or
a coma, or a satellite. The favourable state of the air appear
ing then verv precarious, Dr. Herfchel did not attempt to ascer
tain the apparent diameter of the planet by means of his lamp-
niicrotnetcr, as some preparations and adjustments would
iiave been necessary before he could have availed himself
of that curious apparatus.        But in order to form some esti
mate as to a point of so much importance, he adopted a happy
expedient, and very suitable to the urgency of the moment.
The Georgian planet being situated near at hand, in the
fame region of the heavens, he directed his telescope first to
it, and then to the other, with his attention fixed upon
making      acomparative estimate of the apparent diameter of
each disc.     In order to this, and to avoid as much as possible
certain fallacies to which this method        more or less liable, he
                                                    is
was careful to form estimates over and over again, according
as his telescope was last turned from the greater disc to the
smaller; and vice versa.        From such observations, frequently
repeated,   he   concludes   that   the apparent diameter of the
Ceres FerdinanJea         about
                             is       fourth part only of the ap
                                         a
parent   diameter  of the Gcorgiuni Sidus.      Bv applying there-
tore the proper calculation, Dr. Herfchel has inferred that the
real diameter of this ncvvlv found primarv planet, called Ceres
 FerJ'inandea,     is
                    only    little more than half of the diameter
                              a
of our moon and less than 5-8ths of it. The smallness of
the planet, together with the great inclination of its orbit,
are peculiarities which may probably lead to other discoveries
in the solar system.

forward in foreign journals, hut corrected                by

    Baron Von Zach, director of the observatory of Gotha,
writes as follows to C. Mechain, administrator of the obser
vatory of Paris :
    " M. Schroter of Lilienthal has seen, with his large tele
scopes, the new planet Ceres, under a disc of nearly 2''.         He
suspects that it has two satellites.      The planet is enveloped in
a very thick atmosphere, for it appears to be surrounded1 with
much nebulosity. I am very anxious to learn what Dr. Her-
schel will tell us respecting it : in the mean time I thought
it my duty to write you this in haste."
    .Elliptic elements of the new planet, corrected by M. Gauss
 from his last observations :
Diurnal tropical heliocentric motion 7^o-y^6".
 Tropical revolution, i68id 121' 9'".
     It is a curious circumstance that the discovery of thisplanet
 has been long expected, and even in some measure predicted.
 Professor Bode, of Berlin, in his Kurzcr Entwttrf der Ajlro-
 nomijcben JViJfencbafttn, Berlin i 794, § 387, has the follow
 ing passage :
     " Is it probable that Uranus, or the Georgian planet, is really
 situated at the utmost limit ot' our solar world ? This appears
 to be very doubtful, considering the immense space interposed
 between it and the nearest fixed stars.           Other planets per
 haps may      be  still more  remotely  situated,   and mav perform
 their revolutions unseen by human eyes. We can scarcely
 suppose that any planet exists nearer to the fun thnn Mercury:
 but considering the proportions of the distances of the planets
  from the fun, we observe between Mars and Jupiter, a di
  stance far greater than a comparison of the other distances
  would lead us to expect, and this space may perhaps be
  occupied bv a planet yet unknown."
      Similar ideas seem to have been entertained in this country,
  even long anterior to the conjectures of Lambert and the
  German astronomers, as appears by the following, which is
  given as a note in a work lately published on astronomy, by
  Mr. Olinthus Gregory, tc.eher of mathematics, Cambridge.
      " Mr. Matlaunn and other philosophers expected nearly
  one hundred years ago, that i'uch a discovery as this of
                     6                                          Piazzi

Piazzi would        be made by some diligent astronomer ; and
the opinion has been lately revived by Mr. Capel Lofft, a.
gentleman well known for his attachment both to the sci
ences and the muses. In die New London Review for March
1800, this gentleman, in a critique on the Athenian Letters,
ventured to osier some conjectures respecting an intermediate
planet between Mars and Jupiter, the coincidence of which
with the new discovery is very remarkable. He supposed that
the distance of the intermediate planet from the Sun would

                                     33 to 15, or as 20 to 15, the
midway        between which correlponds nearly with the fact.
With      respect to its diameter, he conceived it might be to that
of Mars, as that of Mars to the diameter of the earth ; and
then being not much more than half the diameter of Mars,
aud at five times the perigean distance, it would be seen from
 the Earth under an angle of 2]!" or 3", while Georgium
Sidus would appear under an angle of 4".                  These lucky
 conjectures were drawn from a certain kind of 'Pythagorean
 harmony, and are ingeniously defended in the Review juit
 mentioned."

 the curve of the globe, and flat at the top.          The sides of this
 bar are graduated, answering to ten degrees of the ecliptic ;
  and the under part is chamfered          so, that the edge may be
  very narrow which lies over the ecliptic, when in use.             On
  the flat top of the bar is a small hole, with a metal pin S,
  serving as a jhie lo call a shadow.             The part which re
  ceives the shadow is painted a dead-white, to pre\ent the
  dazzling which the brass alone would have occasioned.

mediate    in its effects, as also by boaids or other opaque
bodies, which may, in like manner, be rendered visible or
invisible at pleasure, by alternately presenting their fronts or
their edges to the eve. Or by lamps and boards so combined
together, that both or either may be used : but perhaps the
modes easiest in fitting up and application are the following,
viz.;
   Twenty-five lamps arc placed in a frame at equal distances
from each other, as represented bv the white dots in fig. I,
No. 1, (plate III) each having a moveablc cover, or blind,

intelligent mariner or soldier, and may, even at first fight, be

Kfenty-fivc lamps, capital letters are exhibited: with nine
lamps, small letters must sometimes be shown.
           Forms of Signals suggejled            hy the Patentee.
    As only one letter     appears visible at a time, to divide these
letters   therefore   into words, a sign is requisite; for which
 purpose sig. 29, No. 1 or 2, in the respective Telegraphs, is
 exhibited.
    When a vessel approaches another, and wishes to speak
 the stranger, sig. 30, No. 1 or 2, is exhibited, being as much
 as to fay " I wish to speak you."
    When the strange vessel ices this, flie (bows sig. 3 s, No. 1
or 2, as much as to fay " I perceive you wish to speak me,
am ready to hear you;" that         is,to mark down the letters you
exhibit.      When the vessel has spoke, the stranger, in her
turn, exhibits sig. 30, No      t  or 2, and replies.
    Fig. 32, No.      1or 2, represents    sign which the captain of
                                            a
the Eliza throws up, should he wish to speak the captain of
the .lames, without what be says being known to the crews
of either veffel. For this purpose two circular Hut rings of
wood or metal may be put           in  box, the one moveablc on its
                                        a
centre, the other fixed. On one of these rings let the twenty-
six letters of the alphabet be engraven, painted or written, at
equal distances from each other, progressively as they occur in
the alphabet.       On the other ring let these characters be en-

opportunity to speak without confusing me."
    Any two or more signs or characters can be exhibited at
once, thus increasing the number of appearances, which may
be used as different    signals.

    Figs. 39 to 48, Nos. 1 and 2, exhibit the numerical figures
necessary to tell the latitudes, longitudes, 8cc. at sea.      With
the nine-lamp Telegraph, however, (he numerical figures are
more liable to be mistaken, and it might perhaps be as well
rather to/pell the number wistied to be expressed. This lies
in  the option of the speaker.
    These are a few hints concerning this invention, which
may be applied to a great variety of purposes.             By using
lenses before, or reflectors behind each of 'the lamps, to in
crease the glare and render the light more vivid, they become
visible even during the brightest sun-sliine, at a very great
distance.
    At sea the Telegraph hangs on pivots, to vield to the
swing of the vessel; lo remains idwavs perpendicular. For land
iervice this is unnecessary, but in either cafe it may be turned
round so as to face in any direction.
   Thus a complete system of cornmnnicat:on may be esta
blished, — simple, easy, and unshackled ; — not liable to be mis
taken, but legible by day or night to all ; — capable of being
the vehicle of ideas in anv language,       and so quick, that, it
necessary, sixty signs can be exhibited, and distinctly read at a
great distance, in the space of one minute.

    This    mode     of communicating thoughts., information, and
intelligence        would consequently be of much use on light
houses, dangerous coasts, harbours, fortifications, — at head
quarters, and out-posts, — in ihips of war, revenue cutters,
merchant vessels, Sec. Correspondence in this manner might
also be carried on between gentlemen's country feats, it in

                              is a science not only noble and exalted
     itself, but attended with so many advantages that little
needs be said in its favour.              Its utility in navigation, hy
which menus that art has been brought to a state of very
great perfection, is alone sufficient to stiow its importance,
and consequently            the benefits that must arise to society by>
encouraging and promoting it. Most of the civilized coun
tries in Europe, indeed, Lt.ve lately paid considerable at
tention to this important object.              And the great improve
ment made in the construction ot telescopes, and other
astronomical instruments, has produced discoveries, and an
accuracy in observations of the celestial bodies, which other
wise could not have been expected.                   By the munificence
and liberal protection of our most gracious sovereign, who
has always shown himself a friend to science,                these im
provements have been carried to a very great extent in this
country     ; and it must fill the breast ot every patriotic Briton
with     honest pride, to reflect that there is scarcely an ob
servatory in Europe which is not furnished with telescopes
by Hcrlchel or Dollond, and with quadrants, equatorial fec-

tors, transit instruments, &c. by Ramsden and other emi
nent English artists.      But though astronomy has been so
much improved in this country, we were far behind some
of our neighbours on the continent, in regard to good works
on the siibject.     We do not here mean to throw out any
reflections against those authors who have written on astro
nomy, niaiiv of whom are justly entitled to praise.             But
we are of opinion that none of these works, the system of
professor Vinee excepted, is suited to the present improved
state of the science ; for works of astronomv, from the na
ture of the subject on which they treat, the necessity of fre
quently correcting the tables, and other circumstances, must
have a very limited period of utility.        As professor Vince's
work is too bulky and expensive for the great mass of the
public, it gives us pleasure to find that a gentleman so well
qualilied for the talk as Mr. Gregory seems to be, has turned
his attention to this deficiency, and supplied the public with
a comprehensive, clear, and well arranged elementary trea
tise on this noble and useful science.      We have no hesitation
in saying, that we consider it as the best practical work on
the subject published      since the time of Leadbetter.        The
author's rules are simple and easy ; and the whole rendered
so familiar, by a variety of examples, that any person ini
tiated in the principles of the mathematical sciences must
readily comprehend them.           It will be of [ireat utility to
young persons in particular, who are studying astronomy;
and those who have made considerable         proficiency will find
it exceedingly convenient to refer to. The author has omit
ted none or the modern discoveries ; and the tables he has
   iven at the end ire taken from the bett sources, and improved
I  y the latest corrections.

D,     'R. GIBBF.S, in a paper on galvanism, read before the
 Society on the 21 ft of January, assumes an opinion contrary
 to that of Dr. Wollafton, respecting the origin of electricity
 in chemical changes, am! maintains, that the electrical
 chaises are to be considered as preceding and favouring the

 that the action of acids i< effectual        in promoting these

observes upon Dr. Wollaston's        experiment of immersing
sine and silver in an acid solution, that if they are placed in
two separate portions of the fluid, and the parts not im
mersed are brought into contact, there is no emiflion of gas
from the silver ; but that it is copioufly produced when the
contact takes place in the fame fluid.     He proceeds to relate
some experiments which seem to (how a difference between
galvanism and electricity, particularly that galvanism does not
appear to be attracted by metallic points.      He also states an
experiment   in  which  a  piece  of paper  is placed on tinfoil,
and rubbed with elastic gum ; and although the tinfoil is not
insulated, sparks are produced   on raising the paper.    Dr.
Gibbes concludes with some arguments against the doctrine
of the decomposition of water ; and advances as a probable
opinion that oxygen and hydrogen gas are composed of water
as a basis united with two other elements,  which combined
form heat.
   The meetings of the 98th January, the 4th and nth

peroxygenized muriatic       acid,       by Richard        Chenevix,   Esq.
F.R.S.
   After a short account of the experiments that had been
made before him, and particularly of the ingenious conjec
ture of Mr. Berthollet *, Mr. Chenevix proceeds to state the
means by which he has ascertained,    that the acid contained
in hyperoxygenized muriate of potasti is muriatic acid in
a particular state of combination with oxygen, and the ex
periments by which he determined the proportion of these
elements.
   From the quantity of oxygen and of simple muriatic acid
contained in the salt, he proves that hyperoxygenized muri
atic acid is composed of
           oxygen               -

   From the proportions of the salt which is formed when a

   *o              Royal Academy   of Sciences at Berlin.
      From    a number    of experiments which are stated at length,
   Mr. Chenevix imagines that the          salts of the genus oxyge
  nized muriate do virtually exist ; but that, by superior af
  finities, they are all resolved into muriates and hvperoxyge-
  nized muriates at the very moment the acid comes in con
  tact with the bases.
     He describes and analyses all the salts of the genus hyper-
  oxygenized muriate ; and mentions the hypcroxygenized
  muriate of ammonia as an extraordinary instance of di
 spersing affinities. He obtained the alkaline salts pure by re
  peated crystallizations ; and the earthy salts, by boiling them
 with phosphate of silver.
     He has examined likewise       several of the metallic salts of
 this genus, and mentions hypcroxygenized muriate of silver
 as strongly marking the difference between muriatic and hy-
 peroxygenized muriatic acids. He ascribes to this salt, when
 mixea with any combustible bodv, an expansive force, which
 he thinks he will be within bounds if he states to exceed
 five times that of any known detonating salt.
     He concludes with an appeal to the chemical world, whe
 ther, in the present state of the science, it would not be more
 philosophical to say,

 and states the arguments in favour of each appellation.
     As a warning to those who would repeat his experiments,
he relates, in the course of his paper, an accident that hap
pened in his laboratory, to himself, and to Ms. Vandcer, by
which the latter gentleman had almost lost his sight, and was
wounded in the most dreadful manner.
     On the 4th and nth of February, letters from Dr. Maske-
lyne, Mr. Von Zach, Alex. Aubert, Esq. and Mr. Gilpin,
clerk to the Royal Society, were read, slating that they had
observed the new planet.         As we have already given its ob
served places,        (fee p. 54, Sec.) we need not here repeat
them.
    On the iSth of February, a paper by Dr. Herschel on the
same subject was read. His results are given in the preceding
pages    .

                                                                  copied

Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon were collected arouud
the beautiful liar called Rcgulus or the Lion's heart.
    This was not a real conjunction, since there was between
all these stars the distance of several degrees. These assem
blages, respecting which astrologers formerly made so much
noiic, and which, according to them, were to be followed by
dreadful catastrophes, have always passed over in a very tran
quil manner, and have produced no other effect than that of
covering with confusion these silly prophets.     They are also
attended with no other benefit than that of affording to the
astronomer an opportunity of observing several of the planets
at the fame time.       C. Messier took advantage of this cir
cumstance to six the respective situations of those which were
then in the neighbourhood of Regulus.       The conjunction of
several  planets being a circumstance very uncommon may
serve also to fix the epoch of any event, and in such an inva
riable manner that no change of œra or in the calendar can
render it doubtful.
    C. Prony read to the class a notice of some experiments
made with an English rule, constructed according to the
standard of those employed in the grand trigonometrical ope
ration of general Roy, and brought to Paris by professor Pic-
 tet of Geneva, and which was compared with the metre of
 the Institute, and the toise called the Peruvian. -
    C. Flagucrgues sent some observations of the planets, and
 of different eclipses.
    Chemists were acquainted with two metallic combinations,
 which have the remarkable property of producing a violent
 detonation, when subjected to a slight compression, or when
 exposed to a slight degree of heat.    These combinations are
 fulminating gold and silver. Mr. Howard has lately made
 known a third, which possesses the fame property, and to
                                                         which

 which      he has given the name of fulminating mercury.                     It is
 attended, however, with this difference, that it is not pro
 duced under circumstances similar to those under which gold
 and silver susceptible os detonation are obtained.                   It is form
 ed bv the ebullition          of nitrate of mercury with alcohol, and
 deposits    itself  in   a  powder, the colour os which varies from
 white to a gray more or less dark.                   It was necessary to find
 in the analysis of this substance an explanation of its pro
 duction, and that of its resemblance to fulminating gold and
 silver; and also of its differences from them.                    Mr. Howard
 concluded from his experiments, that it was composed ol
 oxalic acid, oxide of mercury, and ethereal nitrous gas.
      C. Berthollet has shown by his, that it contains no oxalic
 acid ; but that it contains ammonia ; that it forms in this
 respect a combination analogous to fulminating                         cold and
 silver; and that, consequently,               its effects ought to be ex
plained in the fame manner as those of these compounds.
Fulminating mercury differs from these two detonating me
tallic substances, by a portion of altered alcohol, which en
 ters into the combination,              and which, when decomposed,
produces carbonic acid.                 Fulminating mercury then is a
triple combination, while fulminating gold and silver are only
binary combinations of the oxides ot these metals with am
monia.
      C. Vauquelin read a memoir on the analysis he made
of a copper ore discovered in Derbyshire, specimens of
which had been transmitted to the Council of Mines by
Count de Beurnon.                Vauquelin states, that this ore is com
posed of 62 parts oxide of copper, 24 parts of arsenic acid,
8 parts arseniatc of iron, and 8 parts water of crystallization.
•
     Vauquelin having been requested also by the Council of
Mines to examine a mineral sent to it by M. Karstein of
Berlin, under the name of arseniated copper, ascertained that
this mineral is formed of 60 parts oxide of iron, 22 parts ar
senic acid, and 18 parts water of crystallisation; but that it
contains not an atom of copper. Neither copper nor iron
had been before found united to the arsenic acid; and this
is the reason why the mineralogists had made no mention
in their works of the arseniate os iron or arseniatc of copper.
The labours of C. Vauquelin have therefore enriched with
two distinct species the catalogue of mineral substances al
ready known *.
    C. Vauquelin read also a memoir on a mineral found in
the environs of Limoges, which C. Alluau, director of the
porcelain manufactory in that city, had transmitted to him
   '.  This is a mistake.    See Philosophical   T:ans. iSqi, part  1. — Edit.

  under the name of tin ore.        He has discovered that this ore
  is composed of 42 parts of the oxide of manganese, 27 phos
  phoric acid, and 31 oxide of iron.          He is of opinion that
  these three substances are intimately united, and form a
  kind of triple fill t with a double base. This combination is
  absolutely new to naturalists.        No one had spoken of it
  before C. Vauquclin.        It nutst hold a particular place, in the
 systems of mineralogy, either in the genus of iron or the genus
 of copper.
      C. Gillet-Laumont read to the class an account of a mi
  neral already known to naturalists, though they were too
  little acquainted with its situation in the earth.         This sub
  stance, which contains a metal lately discovered by Vauquelin,
  is chromaled iron.     It had been seen in an insulated mass bv
  C. l'ontier, near Gostin, in the department of the Var. But
  this mineralogist has since found         in very great abundance,

                     de Physique (Brumaire, an 10.) contains a
notice of the discovery of corundum, at Chesnut Hill, near
Philadelphia, bv Dr. Seybert. From a few experiments upon
the most obvious properties of a specimen received from the
discoverer, made by Mr. Richard Phillips, to whom we arc in
debted for the prelent article, he is induced to believe that it is
not corundum : it has for matrix decomposed felspar, accom
panied bv while felspar and mica ; only one crystal was contained
in the specimen, whose form was sufficiently determinate forde-
scription; it appeared to be a compressed hexaedral prism, having
one of its sides interrupted in crystallizing ; its colour inclining
to green ; its hardnels sufficient to give fire with steel, and to
scratch glass ; but it is itself easily scratched by corundum,
and is not hard enough to mark the beryl ; whereas the latter
is readily scratched by corundum.          It is easily reduced to
powder.     Its specific gravity only 2,70, that of corundum
being 3,87 : the quantity was too small to allow of accurate
analysis ; upon examination it would probably be found to be
quartz, which it nearly resembled in fracture, deriving itj
colour from oxide of iron.
    The following account of the discovery of a mine of
 native sulphur in the Lower Pyrenees has just appeared in
 one of the French journals,     in a letter from Dr. Thore,
 " Permit me to announce, through the medium of your

 sulphur, by a proprietor in the commune of Saint Boue, de
 partment of the Lower Pyrenees. Accident, the grand author
 of discoveries, was the author of the one in question.

that occasioned it.

 others very curious crystallizations.

               SUGAR FROM THE BEET-ROOT.
    Doctor Achard has published, at Berlin, the results of a
 second trial, made on a large scale, to extract sugar from the
 beet-root, under the direction of a commission appointed for
 that purpose by his Prussian majesty.       By these results it ap
 pears that 1500 quintals of beet-root gave S95~ pounds of
 raw sugar ; 450 quintals of refuse, and 100 ounces of syrup.
 Thirty quintals of beet-root, cultivated according to the pro
 cess of Achard, gave each six pound; three ounces of raw
 sugar.   The refuse may be employed as coffee, or to distill
 spirit; and is more profitable for feeding cattle than beets
 themselves.    The raw sugar may be refined for every pur
 pose whatever.       According to a calculation made by the
 commission charged to examine this discovery, it will pro
 duce to Prussia an annual saving, or rather an advantage, of
 two millions and a half of rix-dcliars.

 in my last appeared, in opposition to the theory adopted by
 the Parisian chemists, that the decomposition of carbonic
 acid afforded the steely principle to iron, I deemed the exa
 mination imperfect, unless experiments were made with va
 rious carbonates, and particularly with those foreign to this
 country.         With a view therefore to give evlty degree of jus
 tice and candour to the investigation, the experiments which
 follow were carefully and accurately, performed.

 with equal portions of Italian marble and Stourbridge old
 day    pot.                                                               Grains.

 I obtained in 40 minutes a very perfect fusion. The
metallic button poflcHed a dense smooth surface, free
from pits and honeveombs.                 It weighed               -        897

lurface.         Its colour was light bottle green, some shades
purer     than     the glass of experiment No. 1. afforded with Bal-
grochan        limestone.
     The button now obtained was cut, and broken across an
anvil.        Its fracture was regularly granulated, of a dark blue
grain, very prominent, but pervaded with a dull lead colour
betwixt the crystals.          One-half of this button was drawn into
a small drilling tool, and hardened with a degree of heat be
yond that of common steel. The file, at sirst, met with a
flight resistance; but a few strokes removed the partial hard-
nels, and an uncommon soft iron succeeded.                      This drill was
introduced below a drilling frame loaded with only 7 lbs.
upon the end of the lever.                The brace was not turned half

 This proportion is fix to one of that prescribed by
 C. Clouet, and from which gray cast iron should
 have been obtained.           In 45 minutes I deemed the
 fusion complete, and withdrew the crucible.              When
cold, I found a very perfect metallic button resting
beneath a great thickness of glass.           The external ap
 pearance,     in every point, resembled that of No. 1.

 equal   to  —-    part the original weight of iron.       The  glass in
 this experiment was several shades lighter than that obtained
in No.    7.    The reason for this seems obvious, as seven times
 the quantity of glass possessed only a quantity of colouring
principle similar to the former, if by this be understood the
 specific quantity of iron lost in fusion.             The fracture of
 this button was precisely that of No. 7. One-half of it was
drawn into a small cutting chisel, and hardened at a pretty
bright red heat.       It flialed a little, and felt, for a few strokes,
perceptibly     harder  under the file. Upon applying the chisel to
 cut a piece of newly hammered Swedisti iron, it made a consi
 derable impression with a moderate blow from a 31b. ham
 mer; but the whole edge was flattened, and at a second blow
 the edge staved completely, and measured nearly i-8th part
of an inch across.
    A fragment of the fame experiment was subjected to a

   One half of this button was forged into a point, and hard
ened at a high heat for common steel.             I endeavoured to
pierce a piece of thick rolled plate iron ; but at the first blow
the point bent upwards, throwing a white stiale and leaving
the surface like tin.
   The glass obtained by the fusion of lime alone in this ex
periment was very different from that in Nos. 7 and 8. It
possessed a rich grassy green colour, free from air bubbles
and very transparent.       1 he extra loss of metal in this expe
riment beyond that in Nos. 7 and 8. may be accounted for
from the infusibility of carbonate without the usual addition
of clay. I have repeatedly found that lime alone, when
pure, gradually contracts its bulk, and remains unfused a
considerable lime after the iron has entered into fusion. This
naturally exposes the latter to a greater degree of oxidation
 than when covered by a fusible glass during the greatest part
of  the exposure.

50   minutes,     when     I judged from the degree of heat
that the fusion was complete.            When cola, I found a

 From the purity of the Kilkenny marble I judged it
 requisite to expose this mixture to a very high degree
 of heat, which continued nearly one hour.                  I found
 a perfect fusion of the lime, and a very sine button of
 metal.      The latter weighed                  -            -        828

 equal    to  — — th part of        the  original   weight.     The form,
 appearance,      and density of this button exactly corresponded
 with that of No. 9, when Italian marble was fused along
 with iron.       Its fracture was in most respects similar, and the
 subsequent trials proved that its quality was also the fame.
 The loss in metal was greater in this experiment than in
 No. 9, probably arising from the iron being longer exposed
 under a high temperature before the carbonate, by reason of
 excessive purity, entered into fusion.            The glass produced by
 the fusion of this marble in contact with iron was,of a black
 colour, and possessed of no great degree of lustre in fracture.
 When pounded small, it              assumed a shade of dirty green,
 differing materially from any of the former.
    I have avoided entering into a detail of the various appear
 ances which these three last products assumed in forcing.
                                                                     Their

Their similarity  and identity with those described in Nos. 7,
8, and 9, rendered    such a description unnecessary.   Suffice
it to say, they were applied in the same shapes to the fame
species of labour, and found equally inapplicable to the pur
poses for which they were intended.
   Neither in the experiments recorded in this paper, nor in
those which accompanied the former communications, was
there found any product resembling steel, or possessed of any
of those  properties which iron derives from its combination
with carbon : on the contrary, the resulting product in all of
them was found debased, in point of strength and elasticity,
below the standard of common malleable iron. The uniform
quality of the various metallic masses, though fused in contact
with widely different proportions of earths, leaves little room
to doubt that the latter are entirely neutral ; nor does it ap
pear, upon a review of the experiments performed with a
mixture of carbonate and argil, that the loss of metal is de
pendent upon the quantity of earths fused in contact with
as the following table will fliow    the fame review exhibits

The three    first fusions seem to have experienced     smaller  a
loss in metal than the subsequent ones.       This am apt to I
attribute toa   comparatively imperfect fusion, as the buttons
obtained in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, were considerably pitted, and
everv way less dense than those afterwards produced, when             I
had learnt to regulate the necessary heat to   certainty.a

ioj                     New    Trocess    for making
   In   the   course of making the series of experiments from
which     the foregoing are selected, I had occasion to remark
that the mixture of argil and carbonate, when moderate pro
portions were used, entered into fusion in 10 to 15 minutes
from the period of being introduced into the furnace, and
from 15 to 20 minutes before the iron melted. A few cru
cibles were withdrawn at this early stage of the process; the
glass was found perfectly pure and transparent.                  The pieces
of iron were more or less welded together, but possessed their
original sliape and quality.          And though it may seem some
what foreign to the present subject, I (hall further remark,
that so long as the pieces of iron remained unfused or fusing,
a continual bubbling took place upon the surface of the liquid
glass resembling the discharge of an elastic body.                    I soon
learned to prejudge the degree of perfection in the fusion by
the surface of tTie glass.           In imperfect reductions this was
completely covered with various sized bubbles, many of
which were concentric : on the contrary, when the metallic
button was found possessed of smoothness and uniform density,
the surface of the glass was either entirely smooth, or at most
presented one solitary bubble exactly in the centre, through
which it is presumable, at the time of its fixing, had been
discharging the last portions of the gaseous substance for
merly alluded to.
    In pursuing the investigation of this subject, I had pre
pared a variety of other experiments.                   The fusion of the
 fame Swedish iron         with   deacidified carbonate and argil, in
 various degrees       of  mixture, and with the former alone,
 formed a distinct head.           The familiarity of the results, ex
 cepting    an   alteration   in  the    colour of the glasses, renders
 these experiments no longer interesting.                Others, however,
 performed     with  Britisli  cold   fliort iron,  made    in the stamping
 process,   are  more   worthy    of  notice.
    Various weights of iron were fused with mixtures of argil
 and carbonate, and with the, latter alone.                 In every case, a
 imjch greater. quantity of metal disappeared than in any of
 the former experiments, and a similar difference in the ap
 pearance of the glass.
    1st, In two experiments performed with cold fliort iron
 and an equal mixture of i-3d each of Kilkenny marble and
 Stourbridge clay (old pot) in the one, and double the weights
 of  the iron   of  each  in the other, the        loss  of metal was T'-,th
 and x'^th; average,      — -.    The accompanying           glass was   pof-
 sessed tit an   uncommon degree of lustre and density. Its frac
 ture presented a pylilb and colour superior to black marble                 :
                                                                         very

improved,      iooo grains of this irpn were fused with 666
grains of an equal mixture of Italian marble and Stourbridge
clay pot  : the loss in metal only amounted to      —-    part  of
the original weight of the iron.
   The foregoing experiments are, I conceive, in point of
variety and accuracy, sufficient to demonstrate, that in no
proportion, either alone or in mixture, does carbonate of
lime, by the decomposition of its acid, or otherwise, com
municate carbonaceous matter to iron fused in contact with
it. In seeking, therefore, for an explanation of the phæno-
mena which have so completely deceived the Parisian che
mists, the two following reasons occur as being most proba
ble. The crucibles used may have contained a portion of
carbonaceous matter, or the reporters have been deceived by
the ignorance or intention of their artists.    If the latter has
been the cafe, then the concluding paragraph of my com
munication in January will apply with peculiar force : if the
former, the following experiments will, (how how easily the
deception might have taken place.

   The ingot was cut into three pi cces, each of which was

the product upon the first operation displayed an intimate

turated with carbon.      A razor and several penknives were
made from this result, all of which hardened to excess with
a low shade of red.

    This steel was, in point of quality, softer than any of the
former ; and from this circumstance I inferred that the earths
 so far contributed to the steelification of the iron by fusing
upon the surface of the metal, and preventing the escape of
the carbon.      It appeared also further adducible, that if the
iron was presented with a sufficient dose of carbon to make
allowance for waste, itcel sliould be formed without the addi
 tion of any portion of earth.
    4th Experiment will justify the first inference.           Grains.
    Into a black lead crucible was introduced           -       37 10
of the iron emp'oyed in former experiments. A tight
lid was fitted to the crucible, and the iron exposed to
as high a heat as I judged the crucible capable of sus
taining. This continued, from first to last, for 38 mi
nutes, when the crucible was withdrawn.               When
cold, I found that the iron had funk to the bottom,
forming an imperfect ingot of steel of a proper degree
of saturation of carbon at the under part, but almost
of the nature of malleable iron towards the upper sur
face. It weighed                 -          -         -         369S

equal to    -r^th part  of the weight  of the iron.
    The latter inference was justified in the course of some
hundreds of experiments with various carbonaceous sub
stances and iron, the ultimate result of which proved that
excellent cast steel could be formed in crucibles destitute of
carbonaceous mixture by the single addition of carbon.

      Sir Isaac Newton, in ObseKv. iv. part i. book 2. marking
 the order of colours      in    the circles produced   by  the refrac
 tion of light between two lenses, fays,         "  the green was very
 copious and lively, inclining on one fide to blue, on the other
 to yellow :" and again, in part ii. book 2. p. 202. he fays,
"     the green exhibited  is     principally constituted of original
 green,hut not without mixture of blue and yellow:" again,
                           a
 in part book 2. p. 190. he fays, " then after lively orange
          i.                                           a

  the best of all the yellows this changed first to greenisti

  ther greenish white than green: the blue which succeeded
      a                         a
  became very good."          In this observation made on the rings
  of colours on bubbles, notice the increasing intenseness of
  the light also successive gradations
              ;                            ;    also the gradual pro
  cess of the composition of green and of its decomposition,
  which   is  given in the next observation, p. 189     :    "After the
  red succeeded little or no yellow, but    a    copious green, which
  at first inclineda   little to yellow, then became    a   pretty brisk
   and good willow -green, and afterwards changed to             blueish
                                                                 a
   colour ;   but there succeeded neither blue nor violet." In tlie
   first instance, the very little and dilute greenish white, as well
   as the willow-green in the second, was the dominancy of an
   intervening white, as will come out hereafter       ;   and in both
   instances the yellowish green and blueisli green mark the
   compound, partaking on "each side of the yellow or of the

blue,   as the  one or the other predominated in the compo
sition.
   But   to put tliis matter out of all doubt, the sa£i comes out
on experiment, that when the gradations of the colour take
such an arrangement that there is no intersection of the yel
low orbicular images with those of the blue, and so no coa
lescence of these colours, there is no green.
    Observ. iv. part i. book ii. p. 174. Sir Isaac Newton says,
" the   colours reckoned in their order from the centre were,
black, blue, -white, yellow, red ; here the blue and yellow
not intersecting or coalescing, but separated by an intervening
¦white,   there was no green in this gradation of colours : if
they  had    approached      somewhat   near to an intersection of
their circles, there might have been, as above, a whitish or
willow-green bordered with yellowish and blueish green.
The same fact is stated in Observation ix. p. 181 : the order
of this gradation was, " violet, blue, white, yellow, red."
Here again an intervening space of white excludes the exist
ence of green.       The fame fact of an intervening white be
tween the yellows and the blues, excluding the green, cornea
out in some experiments and observations made by G. W. J.*
in addition to those made by hir Isaac Newton, where, in
p. 99. he states, that
                             " diluted purple and blue hues
                                                                  appear
completing, with the external yellow and red, and ail inter
vening white, these formations of these fringes."                 I will
venture to add, in confirmation of all this, one amongst se
veral observations which I made on these facts.                Viewing,
through     a  prism, the solar light as it came through a fasti
window,      and taking the spectrum in the line of refraction as
it came from above, the following circumstances appeared :— .
The frames of the fasti were dark, and gradations of colours
proceeded from them.           The gradations of blue on the upper
fide; those of the red, orange, yellow, from the lower side.
The gradations proceeded from the upper fide in this order —
deep blue, and, in succession, the several lighter tints or hues
of blue till they    vanished in the solar light.    From the under
part thev proceeded in this order — deep red, then a brighter,
going into orange, and the orange successively brightening
into yellow, which melted off into the solar light : no gra
dations of blue succeeded either order, because there was
no going off of light into shade when the spectrum was thus
transparent to the solar light ; and as there was no blue to in
termix with the last yellow, there was no green. In proof that
this is the reason, it may be observed, that if the light itself

through which the spectrum is viewed, decreases, in any con
siderable degree of its brightness, there will come on blueifli
hues, and a very faint intervening greenish one. To try this
circumstance more decidedly, I threw up the sash, and made
an assistant hold a broad rule, so that I might view the spec
trum as it proceeded from the two edges in the fame manner
as from the frames of the fash : I then directed my assistant
to lower the rule down to the bottom of the window, till the
yellow in the under gradations intersected the bottom. The
I  ellow of this position not going off into transparent light,
   ut into shade, the blue hues appeared in very decided tints
through all their gradations ; and where blue, succeeding to
the yellow, intersected            decided green intervened.
                                  it,   a
    Although no common eye, unpractised in the use and ar
rangement of colours and their various tints, can discover in
the spaces of the prismatic colours called homogeneous, when
thrown on an opaque surface, any gradations of tints yet      ;
when these colours are viewed                by
                                         the prism through an open
light   so as to be  transparent,   the  gradation of successive tints
in each homogeneous space becomes evidently observable to
the most common eye.            The observer may discern the fact,
that no one of those prismatic colours which are called ho
mogeneous      is  absolutely so, but that, as according to the
theorem stated          by
                         Sir Isaac Newton himself, they consist of
a   successive series of innumerable circular or orbicular images
of the fun the tints of the commonly called homogeneous
           ;
 colour, red, vary according to the innumerable succeeding
 angles of refraction, heightening gradually towards orange,
 and going gradatim into the orange; and that the orange
 heightens in the fame gradual succession of tints going into
 yellow, and the yellow, in like manner, into pure light                :
 also that the blues of the other gradation of colours are an
 indiscriminate succession of tints or hues.
     Conformably to what          here stated of the heightening of
                                   is
 the gradations of the colours at one end of the spectrum into
 light of the blues going off,

      Now from      a  more decisive examination of the fact        by
  actual experiment we shall be led to see demonstrably that
  these apparent hues, which are called blue colours, are not
  colour, but  a mere modification of light going off into shade,

                                                                    In

      In the first place, it is known by Sir Isaac Newton's ex-
    criment, (Optics, book ii. part iii. prop. 7. p. 236.) " tliat
 I  lacks are inclined to a blueifh colour may be seen from illu
  minating white paper by light reflected from black substances,
  for the paper will appear of a hlueijh white."
      In considering this observation on a fact as made by Sir Isaac
 Newton, the method to try the effect of throwing a partial por
  tion of light on a (hade occurred to me. I darkened a room
 partially, letting in a beam of light of five or six inches breadth
 by opening one of the shutters.        I then threw the shade of
 a ruler, by the intercepted     light of a candle, on a sheet of
         : I then held this paper,    with this shade so formed on
 paper
 it, in the beam of light. The effect of this portion of day
 light thus thrown on the shade of the ruler was, that the
 shade exhibited a pale but decided blue.         As I removed this
 paper, with this shade of the ruler thus thrown on         it,further
 back from the entrance of the light, but still in the fame beam,
 this blue, without the alteration of any one circumstance but
a   further deprivation of light, became of        a stronger, more
 decided, deeper blue and;      To on gradually as  I   removed this

               a             This stiade, suffering this gradual de
privation of light, exhibited all the gradations called blue
which are seen      in  the prismatic spectrum.     Here, then, the
fact stands ascertained,     that blue   is the effect of   a   partial
light, and that    a   gradual deprivation of light gives all the
gradations of blue as they go off into dark.
     Mountains and hills, and even unelevated land, in the ho
rizon exhibit,     by the going off or deprivation of light, blue
tints in   the most distant, though such are not the natural tints
of these objects; and as these objects suffer more and greater
deprivations of light in the evening, or from any other inci
dental circumstance, these hues go through all the gradations
of blue. This any one may fee every day; and the painter,
if  heis   an artilt, knows how to copy this phænomenon in
the arrangement of his colouring.
    Another circumstance in the landscape of nature                still
                                                                  is
further to be observed.       As the stiade of evening comes on,
the blue in the distant horizon not only becomes deeper,
but, when the departing light skirts the line of the horizon,
this blue, without any change in the state of .the refractions,
or of the actual colour of the objects, .becomes       a strong vivid
purple.      The dark blue of the clouds just above this skirting
os departing light, changes in like manner.         The rays of the
reddisti-yelsow light and thole of this blue coming          in  coin

regions of the atmosphere this blue becomes of           deep hue               a
going  oft' into  dark.
   This circumstance takes place and prevails           the claro-             in
obscuro of all figures.      A true artist knows, that   he would              if
copy the real fail in nature, he must tint the going off of
light not with gray and black but with gradations of blues,
and give        faint suffusion of green in the first going off.

Zincke, the famous painter in enamel, understood and copied
this fact he worked an almost insensible green into the blues

of the first going off of his lights.
   If one may then assume the fact here grounded on the
experiments and observations of Sir Isaac Newton, with ad
dition of some further ones on the cafe as existing in nature,
that the gradations of blue are mere effects of the privation
of light as        sinks into ihade or darkness

 fraction of prisms or of lenses, or by thin plates of air or
 water between lenses made to approach each other, or by
 the rings on bubbles, or by reflections or inflections of light,
may be explained from the facts contained in the above pro
position.
    All the experiments, observations, and reasoning above,
 respect only coloured light.  I dare not venture, on theory,
to assert any thing as to the existence of an elementary, pure,
uncoloured, uncompounded white light; yet that some such
elementary substance exists, combined with one or more of
the principles of our atmosphere, and also in combustible
and incombustible, and perhaps animal and vegetable sub
stances, seems to be probable ; for it can be separated from
such in various operations of nature and art.
    However, although light may principally exist, combined
with caloric and other substances, in a gaseous form, yet it
may, and it is very generally admitted, that it does also exist,
independent of caloric, in solid bodies and fluids of various
kinds ; and heat, it cannot be denied, exists sensibly in both
combustible and incombustible bodies which exhibit no vi
sible light. Indeed, that light and heat are two distinct exists
ing principles is now finally and demonstrably ascertained and
proved by. Dr. Herschel's curious experiments of the fact,
mowing that heat as well as light are each liable to different
and peculiar refractions, by which they are separated from
each other, and take a separate and distinct existence in dif
ferent space.

 JL HE      commencement of the 19th century was distin->
guistied  by  an astronomical event, the discovery of a planet
at Palermo in Sicily, by M. Piazzi, on the 1st of January*.
It was as small as a star of the 8th magnitude : he observed
it during forty days. The observations he sent me arrived
too late for us to be able to follow          it,
                                      and we were obliged to
calculate its orbit from his own observations alone.   Burck-
hanlt, Olbers, t?ode, Piazzi, and Gauss, have found that
to represent these observations      necessary to suppose that

   On the 25th of October we received a printed memoir of
Piazzi, with his observations and calculations. As he hopes
that this star will be acknowledged to be a planet, he has
given it the name of Ceres Ferdinandea, in honour of the
king of Naples ; and Bode wishes it to be called Juno : as
for my part, I shall call it Piazzi, as I gave the name of Her-
fchel to the planet discovered in 1781.' The pagan deities
are no longer interesting, and adulation pleases only the
person who is the object of it.
   On the 1 2th of July, in the evening, Messier, Mechain
and Bouvard, each found a small comet near the head of
the Great Bear j and it appears that it was seen the preceding
night by Pons, concierge of the observatory at Marseilles.
The Board of Longitude has given him the 600 francs which
I deposited in the hands of a notary for the person who should
discover a comet; the three able astronomers of Paris having
themselves judged that the artist ought to be encouraged.
   John Louis Pons was born at Pevre, a village in the de
partment of the Upper Alps, on the 24th of December 176 1,
and has resided at the observatory of Marseilles since the
3d of February 1789 : his conduct, address, and intelligence,
have procured him much esteem from the director of the
observatory.   He constructed the night-telescope, with which
he discovered the comet of the nth of July 1801, on the
model of a telescope by George Adams, which is at the
School of Navigation, Marseilles.       The Board of Longitude
have sent him a better one.
   I have had a new proof of the utility of the fifty thousand
stars which I have procured to astronomy, and of the exact
positions which my nephew Leframjois has fixed for the stars
formerly observed. Several of them have served to determine
the places of the new comet, which Messier, Mechain and

will   be very well determined, though it appeared                only ten
days.
    Thulis    has sent me seven observations, from the I2th to
the 21st    of July,    deduced only from the azimuths and alti
tudes,    without    having been able to compare them with stars ;
but we were more fortunate at Paris, and Mechain had suf
ficient data to calculate the elements in the following manner
by a first sketch :

    This   small     comet, found almost at the same time by four
persons, proves that it is not difficult to discover comets.
Three or four have been seen in the course of a year ; and
if a few amateurs would employ themselves in searching for
them, it is probable that the number would rapidly increase.
This is still a desideratum in astronomy ; it is humiliating
for us, that we do not know whether it is by thousands or
tens of thousands that comets ought to be counted, and whe
 ther they return, or lose themselves in the immensity of the
universe.
    Nothing is necessary but a common telescope to search for
and find comets, and to point out their situation to astrono
mers.      I suppose that the observer is provided with a wooden
quadrant of two feet radius, which any carpenter can make,
 and that a meridian has been traced out with a large circle
 on the floor ; that the circle is divided into degrees, and that
 the instrument is directed towards the place where the comet
 is. Both the altitude and distance from the meridian will be
 thus found tor the time of observation. Nothing more will
 be necessary to enable astronomers              to find a comet which
 may have been announced.              To find comets, it is not neces
 sary, therefore, to know the stars. But there are a hundred
 nebulæ which have some resemblance to small comets. Those
 who wish 10 distinguish them must have recourse to the Ce
 lestial Atlas *, where they are all marked.               This study will
 neither be long nor difficult.           The Atlas of Berlin is much
 more complete: we shall give an account of it hereafter.
     The night- telescope employed by Messier, and with which
 he has already found twenty comets, is two feet in length,
 aud has an aperture of 2^ inches: it has three eye-glasses.
 The first next the eye has a focus of 2[- inches, and 10 lines
 of aperture; the second 9, and the third o'r inches. There
 are 10 lines between the two, and 5 inches between the pre

 1770, nor has it appeared since.       This can be ascribed only
 to great changes in its orbit.
    Must we then, after having asserted, in the 18th century,
 that all the comets return, assert in the 19th that comets do
 not return, that of 1759 excepted?
    On this account I no longer think but of comets ; I speak
of nothing but comets ; and the only thing I recommend to
 my correspondents is to search for them, as I write to them
 that the only thing wanting to astronomy is the knowledge
of  these bodies.
    On the 15th of May I had the pleasure of receiving the
first copy of my Hijloire Cclcjle Framboise, the fruit of twelve
years labour, which terminates the 50,000 stars, on which my
nephew Michel Lefrancois has employed the best part of his
youth.     It contains also observations made by D'Agelet be
fore he set out on his voyage round the world ; and those by
which Darquier, aged 83 years, terminated his glorious astro
nomical career.
    The observations of Tycho, Flamsteed, Picard, Lacaille,
and Maskelyne, have been the foundation of all the progress
made in astronomy. The most profound theories and the
most learned calculations cannot do without them, and can
not dispute with them in regard to importance or duration.
Observations alone will survive us ; and observers, whom
mankind too often affect to undervalue, may console them
selves, that they will be the only astronomers to whom, long
after their death, the praises and gratitude of our successors
and of posterity will be addressed.
    Lefrancois Lalande, my nephew, continues his observa
tions, together with the calculation of 3000 declinations and
1000 right ascensions of the principal stars, each observed
several times.    These long and painful labours have obtained
for this able observer a place in the National Institute. On

  the afith os December madame Lefrancois Lalande continued'
  the reduction of the 50,000 stars ; an immense labour, to
  which she has devoted herself with courage, and which her
  pregnancy even has not interrupted. Their son is preparing
  to tread in their steps, and already calculates with some suc
  cess.   I hope that Isaac Lalande will be the third astronomer
  of his name.
     Delambre has observed several declinations with the mul
  tiplying circle. Piazzi has announced to us a catalogue of
  Jco stars, which he observed at Palermo ; and Cagnoli is
  preparing a catalogue of 500 stars, which he observed at
  Paris and Verona with particular care.
     Vidal,  whose courage    and exactness  I have so often cele
  brated, has sent me the continuation of the austral stars,
  which are not well seen at Paris; the oircum-polar stars
  which were wanting, and a very singular triduum. On the
  aid of April and the following days he observed all the
  planets every day.    He has joined to them observations of
  Mercury and the fan at the two solstices with an ingenious
  compass, which he employed to make a great number of ob
  servations on the declination of the magnetic needle.
     Bourg, an astronomer of Vienna, who gained the prize
  proposed by the Institute on the inequalities of the moon,
  continues to employ himself on that subject. He has re
  calculated, with 3000 observations, the 24 inequalities of
  the moon ; and has added new ones, which were pointed out
  to him by Laplace according to his theory.         These tables
  arrived on the 8th of December; the errors do not amount
  to 15"; and the prize of 6000 francs, proposed by the Board
  of Longitude to the first who should make good lunar tables*,
  will be well merited by this able and courageous astronomer.
  The Board of Longitude is still employed in verifying them ;
  but all the observations lately made at Gotha confirm the
  exactness of these tables.      For it was at the observatory
  of Gotha, the sanctuary of astronomy in Germany, that
  M. Bourg finished his labour. Baron von Zach had in
  vited him thither, that he might enjoy all the comforts and
  conveniences he could desire.
     What remains to be done in regard to the theory of the
  moon depends, perhaps, on some terms in which the higher
  powers of the eccentricities and forces must be employed.
  Burckhardt is now engaged in researches on that subject.
     Arabian observations of the 10th century had been em
  ployed for the motions of the moon. The manuscript which
  I fortunately found among the papers of Joseph Delisle made
  us desirous of obtaining he original, which was td Leyden ;
                                                              and

much dispute, is $$" per centurv ; very far from that which
C    Caffini assigned from bad observations made at the ob
servatory with Dad instruments.
    The winter solstice gives us 8" less ; but there is reason to
"believe that this arises from the refraction, which is not yet
 well enough known for small altitudes. Though the obli
 quity is nearly decided, the Academy of Berlin has still pro
 posed this variation as the subject of a prize for the year 1803.
 It requires the most interesting researches and explanations
 in regard to this subject, where several points still remain to
be cleared up.
    All the planets have been ecKpsed by the moon in the
course of this year, as has been observed by Reggio in the
Ephemerides of Milan. This phænomenon is rare.                 We
were not able to make a good observation but of the eclipse
of Venus on the 13th of May. We were, however, indem
nified by the eclipses of that beautiful star the Virgin's Spike,
observed in many places on the 30th of March and the 24th
of May, which enabled me to verify the longitudes of several
countries.    Eclipses of four stars of the first magnitude are
phænomena of very great importance for all determinations
of this kind.                 -
    I have continued to discharge the task, which I imposed
upon myself forty years ago, of calculating all the eclipses of
the fun and stars hitherto observed, and from which astro
nomers had neglected to draw conclusions on account of the
length of the calculations.     I have corrected the longitudes
of Rome and Middlebourg, and of the new city of Wash
ington in America.                                            f
   M. Leduc of Sermonetta, Giietani, and Conti have sent
me observations from Rome.           M. Ciccolini has sent me
some from Florence ; and the day on which the king of
Etruria came to the Institute, I had the pleasure of presenting
                                H3                              to

had been very badly determined, notwithstanding the cele
brity of that capita], and the great number of eminent men
it  has produced.
    M. Kautfch,     a  piarist of Leutomischel in Bohemia, has
finished    an immense    labour on the eclipses of the fun.   He
has calculated, for the whole of the 19th century, charts in
which are seen all the circumstances of these eclipses for every
 country of the earth where they are visible, in the same
manner as they have been inserted in our Ephemerides
since 1750, and at present in the Connotfsance des Temps by
the care of C. Duvaucel.         T wished   to nave the means of
publishing the labour of M. Kautfch, whose zeal and ability
deserve every praise.
    C. Goudin has also published an analytical method for
 eclipses : he has applied it lo the eclipse of 1847, which will
 be the most considerable of this century, and has calculated
 all its circumstances for the whole surface of the earth.
    The conjunctions of the planets are not interesting to
 astronomers,     but they afford a spectacle to the public, espe
 cially  when   connected   with other events. Meflier, therefore,
 remarked, that when the cannon announced to us the hap
 piness of peace on the 3d of October, the Moon, Venus,
Jupiter, and Saturn, were near that beautiful star in the
 Lion's heart.
    We no longer live in times when such phænomena are
 considered    as of importance, but in 1186 the astronomers
 announced terrible revolutions in consequence of the con
junction of all the planets.        I engaged C. Flauguergucs to
 calculate this phænomenon 'exactly by our new tables, and
 he has found that on the 15th of September at 5 h. am.
 all the planets were between 6 signs, and 6 signs 10 degrees
 of longitude.
    These    are not complete conjunctions ; exact conjunctions
 of all the planets are incalculable ; a sketch of these returns,
 in which I employed only days for the duration of the re
 volutions, gave me 17 millions of millions of years as the
 interval between one conjunction and another. What would
 the cafe have been, had I taken into account the hours and
 minutes ?
     As the tables of Mars were the most incorrect, C. Lc-
 francois has been employed on them six months ; he has
 calculated all the observations, and has employed all the
 new perturbations.        He has carried his precision to tenths
 of seconds, aud has at length constructed tables of Mars,
 which will leave very little to be wistied for, and which have

pupil pursue the labour which my master Lemonnier made
me undertake, fiftv years ago, in imitation of Tycho Brahe,
who began his researches on the planet Mars, and who put
Kepler in the way of making his discoveries by means of the
fame planet.      He will soon employ himself on tables of
Venus, taking into account her perturbations.
   For Saturn, the error has been found + 1" in longitude
and — 9" in latitude. Delambre has made new researches
to correct the error of go" in the tables of Jupiter, but it has
been found in the observations       made for 60 years: we
must therefore search for the cause of it in the theory, and
in some new irregularities.
   Bouvard has terminated his calculations of all the per
turbations of the planets, each by the action of all the rest,
according to the theory of Laplace.      The result will be new
tables, which will be still more correct.
   C. Burckhardt has made an analytical and numerical cal
culation of the terms of the fifth order, which were not be
fore taken into account in consequence of the length of the
calculations.    He has found that these terms increase the
great irregularity of Saturn by one minute.
   C. Chabrol has calculated observations of the fun, and
has found that 7" must be deducted from the longitudes
given by our tables. But Delambre has undertaken to cal
culate 7 or 800 observations of Bradley, applying 8 or 10
new equations furnished by calculations of the attraction.
The eccentricity of Jupiter and the earth give equations for
the fun which amount to from 8 to 9".         We shall therefore
soon have new tables of the fun still more correct than those
published by Delambre ten years ago, and to which it apT
peared that nothing could be added.
   For mercury, the error in my tables did not exceed iov.
An observation of Venus on the 24th of May gave me an
error in the tables of + 30".       This seems to indicate that
we ought to deduct 12" from the epoch, but that the equa
tion of the orbit is good.

culated all the eclipses of the fun and stars which have been
observed ; a considerable   and important labour, which re
mained to   be  undertaken.     M. Tricsnecker has given us at
the fame  time a table of all the preceding results in regard to
the position of towns where eclipses have been observed.
    The third volume of the Memoirs of the Institute, the
eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Italian Society, the
Ephemerides of Berlin for 1803 an^ 1804, those of Milan
for 1 801, and the Journal of Baron von Zach during the
whole year, have continued to furnish interesting observa
tions and new memoirs.       Baron von Zach has procured the
observations made by Liesganig at Vienna from the year
1755 to 1774; and those wnich Niebuhr made in the Le
vant in 1 761, and which he did not publish.       We have re
ceived the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1796 and
 1797, and the sixth volume of the Memoirs of Turin ; but
they contain nothing on astronomy.
    The observatory of Paris, having acquired new instru

at Viviers,   and     to Dangos at Tarbe, to enable them to

make more correct and more continued observations.
   Flauguergues has already employed his observations to de

continued to observe the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites; he
has observed the spots of the fun, which were frequent this
year, and has calculated a great many positions of the stars.
    Chabrol has communicated to us a new analytical method
for eclipses, and has calculated several ; he has also verified
the tables of Mars and Mercwry by observations in the pre
sent year.    He has reduced 600 observations of the stars,
and has calculated 600 longitudes in the fundamental cata

grateful acknowledgments.

table of preceflions; that is to fay, of the annual changes of
 the stars in right ascension, according to the data with which
 I furnished him. For thirty years past we have received
 from this worthy pastor marks of zeal, application, curiosity,

XXIV.        Some Account       of the Vnisonous and Injurious Honey
     cf North America.           By Benjamin Smith Barton,
     Al. D.*
 IN    the year 1785            I
                           had an opportunity of observing
some of the disagreeable effects of our wild honey upon
several persons who had eaten of          in the western parts

was periuacled, that     substance which

 1 li                   On the Poisonous Honey
 attention to the subject.         The result of my inquiries I now
communicate to the Philosophical Society.
     It is not necessary to make any remarks on the fabric of
honey.       It may be sufficient to observe, that the honey will
always partake, in a greater or a lesser degree, of *he smell,
the taste, and generalproperties, of the flowers from which
it is obtained. This obvious fact (hould have solicited more
of the attention of those whose employment it is to raise large
numbers of bees for the purpose of obtaining the valuable
product of these little insedts.          But, in this country at least,
hardly any      attention    has been   paid   to the subject.   Perhaps,
the following loose hints, byflsointing out some of the sources
from which an ill-flavoured or pernicious honey is obtained,
may be of some service to the new or remote settlers of our
country.
    I must observe, that in these hints I do not mean to in
clude among the disagreeable consequences of the eating of
honey, the occasional effect of its purging : for although, as
I shall presently observe, a purging is one of the common
effects of the poisonous honey, yet the most innocent honey
will often induce the fame state of the body, when it is eaten
in large quantities, or when it meets with an irritable state
of the bowels.
    The honey which I call deleterious or poisonous honey,
produces, as far as I have learned, the following symptoms,
or effects : viz. in the beginning, a dimness of light or ver
tigo, succeeded by a delirium *, which is sometimes mild
and pleasant, and sometimes ferocious ; ebriety, pain in the
stomach      and intestines, convulsions, profuse perspiration,
foaming at the mouth, vomiting, and purging ; and, in a
few instances, death.          In some persons, a vomiting is the
first effect of the poison.          When this is the cafe, it is pro
bable that the persons suffer much less from the honey than
when no vomiting is induced.                  Sometimes the honey has
been observed to produce a temporary palsy of the limbs ; an
effect which I have remarked in animals that have eaten of
one of those very vegetables          \   from whose flowers the bees
obtain a pernicious honey.
    Death is very seldom the consequence of the eating of
   * An intelligent friend of mine related to me the case of a person who,
for a short time, was severely attested from the eating of wild honey, in
Virginia.    He imagined that a person seized him rudely by one arm, and
then by the other.    After thjs he fell into convulsions, nom which, how
ever, he recovered in about an hour.        It was imagined that this honey
was obtained from a kind of poisonous mushroom.
    i  The Kalmia latifolia.
                                                                       this

this kind of honey *. The violent impression which it makes
upon the stomach and intestines often induces an early vomit
 ing or purging, which are both favourable to the speedy re
covery of the sufferer.            The fever which it excites is fre
quently relieved, in a fliort time, by the profuse perspiration,
 and perhaps by the foaming at the mouth.                 I may add, that
 as the human constitution resists, to an astonishing degree,
 the effects of the narcotic and other poisonous vegetables that
 are best known to us, so we need not wonder that it also
 resists the effects of the deleterious honey which is procured
 from such vegetables.
     It deserves to be mentioned, that the honey which is
 formed by two different hives of bees in the fame tree, or at
 a little distance from each other, often possesses the most op
 posite properties.        Nay, the honey from the fame individual
 comb is sometimes not less different in taste, in colour, and
 in its effects. Thus, one stratum or portion of it may be
eaten without the least inconvenience, whilst that which is
 immediately adjacent to it shall occasion the several effects
 which I have just enumerated.
     I have taken some pains to learn what are the signs by
 which the deleterious honey may, at first view, be distin
 guished from innocent honey.                I am informed that there is
 no difficulty in the matter.
     The poisonous honey is said by some to be of a crimson
 colour; by others, it is said to be of a reddish-brown colour,
 and of a thicker consistence than common innocent honey.
     These are the signs by which, I am told, the most expe
 rienced hunters in the southern parts of North America are
 enabled to distinguish pernicious from innocent honey.
     On a subject such as this, I feel every disposition to pay a
 good deal of deference to the experience of an American
 hunter.       Even philosophers may obtain much -useful in
 formation from hunters, however wandering their life, how
 ever rude their manners.              It is in the power of our hunters
 to enrich natural history with many important facts.                   But
 we ought not, I presume, to confide implicitly in every
 thing they tell us.
     I have good reasons for doubting whether the signs which
 I have mentioned will enable us, in every instance, to deter-
'mine whether honey be poisonous or innocent.
     The honey of the bee, undoubtedly, sometimes partakes
 of the colour of the flowers from which it is gathered. The
 bees gather honey from many flowers of a crimson colour,
       We  shall  afterwards   fee that not one of Xenophon's men died from
the deleterious    honey which they had eaten, in large quantities, on the
 ihoics of the   Euiine  sea.
                                                                        and

  that in Sweden the honey, in the autumn, is principally
  gathered from the flowers of the erica, or heath, and that
  this honey is of a somewhat reddish colour; and ac
 cordingly, he observes, those provinces of the country that
  are destitute of the heath, such as the province of Oelan-
 dia, furnish a white honeys.          The great naturalist fays
  nothing concerning the properties ot the healh honey.
  However, we may presume, when we recollect the minute
  accuracy of Linnæus, that this honey did not possess any
 dangerous properties, otherwise he would have noticed the
  circumstance.    Whilst I resided in Edinburgh I had the
  honey from the Highlands frequently brought to my table.
 I often remarked that this honey had a dirty brownish co-
 Jour; and I was told that it was chiefly procured from the
 different species of erica, perhaps principally from the
  "   blooming hather J," which abound in the Highlands.
 I never heard the people in Edinburgh, although they con
 sume large quantities of this honey, complain that it pos
 sesses any noxious property.    If it were activelv poisonous or
 injurious, the quality would have been long since observed.
 I well remember, however, that, for two years that I used                     it,
     almost always rendered me drowsy.       Sometimes, indeed,
it it                                            moderate dose of
     composed me to sleep as effectually as                a
 laudanum would have done. A foreigner, who had not been
 accustomed to eat anodyne honey, was better capable of re-
 marking the effect which have mentioned than the natives,

 do not find that this singular property of the Scots honey has
 been noticed           by
                     any writers.       have therefore related

 though it rather  opposes any objection to the signs employed
 by   our hunters to distinguish poisonous from innocent honey.
 But he who is studious of truth should relate useful facts as
they are, without regarding what is their connection with a
 favourite system or opinion.
    The learned Joseph Acosta speaks of a gray-coloured ho
 ney-comb which he saw in the province of Charcas in South
 America.     The honey of this comb, he fays, is " sharp and
 Wack." He fays nothing further of its properties *.
    An ingenious friend of mine +, to whom the public are
indebted for a variety of valuable information concerning the
natural productions of various parts of North America, in
forms me, that, in the Carolinas and Floridas, the poisonous
honey is often so similar in colour, taste, and odour, to the
common or innocent honey, that the former cannot be di
stinguished from the latter.     It is owing, he fays, to this cir
cumstance that so many accidents daily happen from the use
of the wild honey. He was informed that it is experience
alone which enables the hunters and others to determine
whether the honey which they find in the woods be poi
sonous or innocent.      They have observed that the injunous
effects manifest themselves in a short time after the honey is
taken into the stomach. They are accustomed, therefore, to
eat a small quantity before they venture to satisfy their appe
tite.    Should this produce any disagreeable effects, they do
not think it prudent to continue the use of it. But            in if,    a
sliort time,     should occasion no inconvenience, they think
                   it
they may, with perfect safety, indulge their appetite to the
full.
    Ihave been informed that the poisonous honey,            by
                                                          boiling
and      by
         strain ii'i, may be rendered as innocent as any honey
whatever.      It  likewise said, that
                    is                       by
                                         long keeping    becomes
                                                            it
harmless.
   The honey of which         am treating
                                    I        poisonous to dogs as

well as to men.
   Hitherto have not been able to obtain any certain in

formation concerning the means to be pursued in the treat

practice has been useful.         As the effects produced by this
 honey    are  so similar  to those produced by several narcotic ve-
             that are well known to us, such as opium, hen-
    ane *, thorn-apples, &c. it is probable that the fame
 fetables
 means of treatment will be found useful in both cases.             Of
 those means it is not necessary to make particular mention in
 this place.
     It would be curious to ascertain whether the bees are ever
 injured or destroyed by the quaffing of the nectar of the
 flowers from which they prepare the poisonous honey. It is
 probable that they are ; and, perhaps, some of the diseases of
 these little insects may arise from this source J.         It is true,
 indeed, that there are some poisonous plants the nectar of
 which the bees will not touch.             This is the cafe with the
fritillaria    imperialis,  or crown  imperial  §. I do not remem
  ber to have seen bees in or immediately about the flowers of
 the common rosebay or oleander            in the tube of which there

 them. The excellent Mr. Evelyn, speaking of the elm, says,
  " But hear an report of this tree for bees, that, surfeiting

St. Ilia    and St. Mary's, in East Florida, that is remarkable
for abounding in vast numbers of bees. These insects, which
were originally introduced into Florida by the Spaniards %
have increased into innumerable swarms, from the facility
with which they procure their food, in perhaps the richest
flowered country of North America. In this tract of country
the alarming effects of the wild honey are often experienced
by the settlers, by wandering hunters, and by savages.
    It is highly probable that this poisonous honey is procured
from a considerable number of the flowers of the countries
which I have mentioned. A complete list of these flowers
would be acceptable ; but such a list it will be difficult to
procure at present.         Perhaps my hints may induce some in
telligent native of the country to favour us with his observa
tions on the subject.           Meanwhile, I am happy to have it
in my power to mention some of the vegetables from whose
flowers the bees extract a deleterious honey, not only in the
country between the St. Ilia and St. Mary's, but also in some
other parts of North America.
    These vegetables are the kalmia angujlifolia and latifolia
of Linnæus, the kalmia birsuta of Walters, the androme d'a
mariana, and some other species of this genus.
    I. Every American has heard of the poisonous properties
of the kalmia angustifolia and latifolia. The former of these
          is known, in the United States, by the names of dwarf-
  aurel, ivy, lambkill, &c. It has long been known, that its
!>lants
leaves, when eaten by sheep, prove fatal to them.               The fol
 lowing fact will show that the flowers likewise are endued with
 a poisonous property.
    About twenty years since, a party of young men, solicited
 by the prospect of gain, moved, with a few hives of bees,
from Pennsylvania into the Jerseys. They were induced to
 believe that the savannas of this latter country were very fa
 vourable to the increase of their bees, and, consequently, to
 the making of honey. They accordingly placed their hives
in the midst of these savannas, which were finely painted with
 the flowers of the kalmia angustifolia.            The bees increased
 prodigiously, and it was evident that the principal part of the
 honey which they made was obtained from the flowers of the
 plant which I have just mentioned. I cannot learn that there
  was any thing uncommon in the appearance of the honey :
  but all the adventurers who ate of it became intoxicated to
 a great degree.          From this experiment, they were sensible

  that it would not be prudent to sell their honey ; but, unwil
  ling to lose all their labour, they made the honey into the
  drink weil known by the name of metheglin, supposing that
  the intoxicating quality which had resided in the honey would
  be lost in the metheglin.             In this respect, however, they
  were mistaken. The drink also intoxicated them ; after which
  they removed their hives.
     la North- Carolina, this species of kalmia and the andro-
  meda mariana are supposed to be the principal vegetables from
  which the bees prepare the poisonous honey, that is common
  in that part of the United States.
     II. The kalmia latifolia, known in the United States by
  the names of laurel, great-laurel, wintergreen, spoon-haunch,
 spoon-wood, &c. is also a poison. Its leaves, indeed, are
 eaten with impunity by the deer*, and by the round-horned
 elks. But they are poisonous to sheep, to horned-cattle and
 to horses. In the former of these animals, they produce con
 vulsions, foaming at the mouth, and death. Many of Ge
 neral Bradock's horses were destroyed by eating the leaves and
 the twigs of this shrub, in the month of June 1755, a few
 days before this unfortunate general's defeat and death.                    In
 the severe winter of the years 1790 and 1791, there appeared
to be such unequivocal reasons for believing that several per
 sons, in Philadelphia, had died in consequence of their eating
 our pheasants, in whose crops the leaves and buds of the kal
 mia latifolia- were found, that the mayor of the city thought
 it prudent, and his duty, to warn the people against the use of
 this bird, by a public proclamation.                I know that by many
 persons, especially      by  some    lovers    of  pheasant-flefli,  the cir
 cumstance just mentioned was supposed to be destitute of
 foundation. But the foundation was a solid one. This might
 be shown by several well-authenticated facts.                 It is sufficient
for my present purpose to observe, that the collection of a de
leterious honey from the flowers of this species of kalmia gives
some countenance to the opinion, that the flesh of phealants
that had eaten of the leaves and buds of this plant may have
been impregnated with a pernicious quality§.

    § It is not a new suspicion, that the flesh of animals that have earen of
the leaves, Sec. of deleterious vegetables is sometimes endued with a poi
sonous property.     Gcorv. H. Wtllchius, a very learned German writer,
quoted by Dr. Haller, (fee Hijioria Stirbium tndigtiiafum tftlvetia h-
tboata, torn. i. p. 44.5.) lays, that the fleflj of a hare which was fed with
the leaves of the rhododendron ferrugineum proved mortal to the guests.
This species of rhododendron is a native of Switzerland, Siberia, and other
parts of the Old World.
                                                                       I  have

      I  have been informed, that our Indians sometimes inten
  tionally poison themselves with a decoction of the leaves of
  this kalmia.         The powder of the leaves has been employed
  (but I suspect with little advantage) in the inflammatory stage
  of certain fevers. From experiments made upon myself, I
  find that this powder is sternutatory.
     To some constitutions the flowers of the kalmia latifolia,
 even externally applied, are found to prove injurious.
     III. The kalmia hirsuta appears to possess nearly the fame
 properties as the two species which I have just mentioned.
 This pretty little shrub is a native of South-Carolina, Georgia,
 and Flo-ida.
     In Georgia and in Florida, this species of kalmia is sup
 posed to be the principal vegetable from which the delete
 rious honey in those parts of our continent is procured.
     IV. The audromeda mariana, or broad-leafed moorwort,
 is a veiy common plant in many parts of North America.
 The leaves are poisonous to sheep. The petioli, or foot-stalks
 of the leaves, and the feeds within the feed-vessel, are covered
 with a brown powder, similar to that of the kalmiæ. This
 powder applied to the nostrils occasions violent sneezing*.
 From the flowers of this plant llie bees extract considerable
 quantities of honey ; and it deserves to be mentioned that this
 honey, as well as that obtained from some other American
 species of andrnmeda, has frequently the very smell of the
flowers from which it is obtained-)-.
     I have already observed, that it is highly probable, that the
 American poisonous honey is procured from the flowers of a
 considerable number of the plants of the country.                     I have
 mentioned but a few of them.                But there are many others
which I have some reasons for suspecting are also capable of
 affording an injurious honey.                Indeed, every flower that is
poisonous to man, and is capable of affording honey, may

    f   In justice to the tine genus of andromeda, I must observe, that all the
species do not furnish a pernicious honey. The andromeda nitida or hicida
of Bartram affords an abundance of nectar, or honev. The flowers of this
species are called bv the country people of Carolina and Georgia,

flowers," not, however, merely fr.'m the circumstance just mentioned, but
from the regular position of the flowers on the peduncle, which open like
the ceIN of a honey -comb, and from the odourof these flowers, which greatly
resembles that of honey.        This species grows abundantly in the swamps
called bay-galls.      The inhabitants of Carolina are universally of opinion,
that it aliurds the greatest quantity of honey, and that of the Best quality.

face, and is too frequently found in company with the rho
dodendron maximum, and the kalmiæ, not to make me sus
picious that it partakes also of the characters of these delete
rious Vegetables,    Moreover, a species of this genus, the
azalea pontica of Linnæus, is supposed to be the ægolethron

poisonous honey about Heraclea Pontica is prepared.         The

    TIL Datura stramonium. This plant is known by a
variety of names, such as Jamestown-weed, gymsin, stink-
weed, French- chesnut.     Its active and poisonous properties
are now pretty generally known.       Children have often been
 injured by eating the feeds.   The tube of the flower contains
 a considerable quantity of honey.    This honey is bitter, and
 has much of the poisonous smell.       Bees quaff it.  But ad
mitting that it is of a poisonous nature, it does not follow-
 that our cultivated bees   (if
                             I  may be allowed to use this ex
 pression) will collectso much of this honey as to prove in
jurious to those who eat of it. But, in particular places,

prove  injurious*.
   Some of the ancient writers of Greece and Rome have re
lated instances of the deleterious properties of the honey of
certain countries      The botanist Dioscorides, speaking of the
rhododendron ponticum, a species of the fame genus to
which our mountain laurel belongs, has the following words:
" About Heraclea I'ontica, at certain seasons of the year, the
honey occasions madness in those who cat of            and this           it;              is
undoubtedly owing       to the quality of the flowers from which
the honey       distilled. This honey occasions an abundant

swallow the excrements of persons who have eaten of this
honey, they fall into the fame accidentsf."
    Pliny has also taken notice of this poisonous honey. " 1st
some years," fays the Roman naturalist, " the honey                  very            is
dangerous about Heraclea Pontica.                        not known to

authors from what flowers the bees extract this honey.
Here        what we have learned ot the matter.           In those parts,
there           is is  called                          flowers  in    wet

The honey which the bees make of them                  more liquid than

makes the very remarks which               have quoted from Diosco

rides, whose words, indeed, as Mr. Tournesort observes, he
seems to have merely translated.               The following remark,
however, appears to belong to Pliny.                 " Upon the fame
 coast of the Pontus, there is found another fort of honey,
which         called mænomenon§, because those who eat of

      The Greeks and the Romans have often described the
 various plants that were known to them, in such dark and
 obscure terms, that the botanists of modern times are fre
 quently at a loss to determine, not merely the species but also
 the genus the ancient writers have mentioned.           With respect,
 however, to the plants which I have just mentioned, the dif
 ficulty does not seem to be great.            Mr. Tournesort has,             I
.think, mown, in a very satisfactory manner, that the ægole-
 thron of Pliny is the chamærhododendros pontica maxima,
 Mesp'ili folio, store luteo of his billitutioncs, a plant since de
 scribed by Linnæus and by other botanists by the name of
 azalea pontica.         Mr. Tournesort has likewise stiown, that the
 other plant called by Plinv rhododendros is his chamærhodo-
 dendros pontica maxima, folio hiurocerafi, store cæruleo pur-
 purascente*.          This is the rhododendron ponticum of Lin
 næus.         It is considerably allied to the azalea pontica.
      Xenophon has recorded the remarkable effects of some
 poisonous
    '
                  honey, in his celebrated work called Memorabilia.
      When the army of the ten thousand had arrived near Tre-
 bisond, on the coast of the Euxine or Black Sea, an accident
 befel the troops, which was a cause of great consternation.
  " As there were a great many bee-hives," says the illustrious
              and historian, " the soldiers did not spare the honey,
    'hey were taken with a vomiting; and purging, attended with,
 feneral
  a delirium, so that the least affected seemed like men drunk,
  and others like mad men, or people on the point of death.
 The earth was strewed with bodies, as after a battlej not a
  person, however, died, and the disorder ceased the next day,
  about the same hour that it began.          On the third and fourth
  days, the soldiers rose, but in the condition people are in after
  taking a strong potions."
       The same fact is recorded by Diodorus Siculus.
       Mr. Tournesort thinks there is every probability that this
  poisonous honev was sucked from the flowers of some species
  of chamærhododendros, or rhododendron. He observes that
  all the country about Trebifond is full of the species of this
  plant, and he remar-s that Father Lambert, Theatin mission
  ary, agrees that the honey which the bees extract from a
   certain shrub in Colchis or Mingrelia, is dangerous, and
   causes vomiting.         Lambert calls this shrub oleandro giailo,
   or the yellow rose-laurel, which Mr. Tournesort lavs                        is,
  without dispute, his cham.erhododendros pontica maxima,

plainly (how, that they were no strangers to the poisonous
properties of certain kinds of honey.    It is not necessary to
mention all these passages. But the following are worthy of
notice.
   Virgil cautions us not to suffer a yew tree to grow about
bee-hives :

      In his 9th Eclogue,                         the fame philosophic poet speaks of
the yews            of Corsica              as   being particularly injurious to bees.

   The raising of bees, for tlie purposes of procuring their

botanists.            If
                  not the yew, what vegetable was it? Perhaps, the buxus
virens, or box.      This vegetable abounds       Corsica, where to this day

     The ancients, who, in some respects at least, were equal
 to the moderns, appear to have paid much attention to this
 subject.     Virgil* and Columella have both told us what
 plants ought to grow about apiaries.                  It is unnecessary to
 repeat, in this place, what the two Roman writers have said
 on the subject.       The Georgia of the Mantuan poet' are in the
 hands of every man of taste ; and the work of Columellaf
should be read, wherever agriculture engages the attention of
 gentlemen.
    ¦The proper management of bees may be considered as a
 science.     It is not sufficient that bees merely make honey
 and wax.       Their honey may be injurious or poisonous, and
 their wax may be nearly useless. To assist and to direct the
 labours of these little insects, the knowledge and the hand of
 man are required. Let, then, this interested being be at least
 attentive to his own benefits and pleasures.                 Let him care
 fully  remove    from    about   the   habitations       of  his bees every
 fetid or poisonous vegetable, however comely its colour or its
 form.     In particular, let him be careful to remove those
 vegetables which are noxious to himself.                 In place of these,
 let him spread the " marjoram and thyme," and other plants,
 "  the love of beesj," and his labours will be rewarded.

The   six triangular planes which compose the pyramid of this
crystal, are always acute isosceles triangles; but three of them
have their acute angle much smaller than the three others.
The (ides of the base of this kind of pyramid are opposite to
the least acute angles       and its truncated apex

   Bv longer duration of the act of crystallization, under
        a

cated apex of the pyramid (sig. 18.) becomes progressively
smaller; the most acute isosceles triangular planes, which
answer to the secondary ones, encroach on the least acute,
all which are the primitive planes of the crystal, and the py
ramid becomes truly triedral at its upper extremity, whilst                         it
remains hexaedral at the base, on account of those parts of
the three planes of the primitive crystal which are still pre

a plane, much more inclined on the side of the prism on
which       placed than on the terminal surface. (Fig. ac.)

                                                                       v         edges

•new  planes have acquired an increase of sufficient extent
to make the primitive planes of the prism totally disappear,
and to replace them, the crystal is changed to a triedral
pyramid with a truncated apex ; the bale and truncated
apex of which are equilateral triangles. (Fig. 31.)       When
it happens that the crystal has, at the fame time, gone
through this modification and that which replaces the solid
angles of its other extremity, and these two modifications
have commenced at the very origin of the formation of the
crystal, there is a particular period of its progress, in which
the crystal is lengthened into a hexaedral prism, with acute
triangular isosceles planes, having for their bases two equi
lateral triangular planes, perfectly equal. (Fig. 22.)     After
this period, if the act of crystallization continues, the crystal
assumes the appearance of an extremely acute rhomboid, the
acute solid angles of which are replaced, more or less com
pletely, by an equilateral triangular plane, (fig. 23.) and
finishes at last by taking the form of a perfect rhomboid.
(Fig. 24.)
    All these varieties, though less common than those of the
first modification, are vet frequently to be met with, except
ing that of fig. 22. which is extremely rare, and of which
I have seen only two or three crystals : in general, however,
the crystals of these varieties are very smalt, and their form
cannot be well seen without the assistance of a magnifying
glass.
   It frequently happens that two of the elongated triedral
prisms (fig. 10.) are closely united to each other by one of
the sides of the prism ; whence results a kind of made
(fig. 25.) the form of which is a rhomboidal tetraedral prism
of 6o° and 1200; but there is always discernible, on the ter
minal surfaces of these prisms, a very fine transverse line, AB,
on the small diagonal of the rhomboidal plane of these sur
faces ; this line (hows the place of union of the two crystals
of which the made consists.
   Sometimes the two component crystals of this kind of
made belong to the triedral prism, which has a secondary
plane in the place of one of its edges; it then has the form
either of a hexaedral pnsin that has four of its sides (two and
two in opposition) broader than the others (sig. 26.), or of one
that has only two opposite sides broader (fig. 27.), or of a
regular one, according to the width of the secondary planes :
in all these forms, the line A    indicating the place of union

138                     Description      of the Arsen'iaUt
meet with specimens of this species in which the crystals are
sufficiently detached to let their form be distinctly seen. la
general, the crystals are grouped together in great numbers,
aud seem to penetrate each other, so as to form mamillæ,
more or less round ; or they form a kind of indented cylin
ders, which have some resemblance to the trundle of a mill.
In that case, the part of the crystals which appears at the
surface       these aggregations, commonly belongs to one of
              of
the   sidesof their prism, either the broad or the narrow one.
But, when these aggregations form either a kind of cylinders,
or of mamillæ in clusters diverging like a fan, there may be
seen, at the two edges of the cylinder, or at the summit of
the clusters, the whole of the equilateral triangular terminal
planes, or trapezia, of one part of the component crystals.
   The specific gravity of this species of arseniate of copper is
nearly the fame as that of the preceding one ; I found it to
be 4,280.      Its hardness, however, is not so great; it is with
difficulty that it can be made to scratch calcareous spar.
   The crystals of this species, when they have not undergone
any change, are transparent, and of a very beautiful blueifh-
green colour, or deep verdigrise ; but their surface easily be
comes decomposed, and turns black ; the crystals are then
totally opaque. It is indeed very seldom, and only in cavi
ties recently exposed, that crystals can be found which retain
their transparency and colour.         Yet, as the change they
undergo commonly takes place only at the surface, rarely
penetrating to any great depth, their original colour may
easily be restored, merely by slightly scraping the surface with
a (harp instrument.
   The above is the only change I have had occasion to re
mark in this species.
   Sometimes, but very rarely, this species is found in the
 orm of small hair pencils, with very delicate fibres ; and as,
in the specimens in whicb I observed this variety, the little
fibrous tuft had preserved its beautiful verdigrise colour, no
thing could exceed the beauty of their appearance.
   I nave likewise observed this species in a mamillary form,
with a compact texture ; but this variety, like the preceding,
is extremely rare.
   The matrix of this arseniate of copper is the fame as that
of all the preceding species ; and that species which is most
frequently found with           the arseniate in obtuse octaedra.
                              it,   is
It    also frequently accompanied with that kind of ore which
     is

                 the name of azure copper ore.

those crystals, or cubes, of a sine green colour, of which lbme
specimens had already been found in Carrarach and Tincroft
mines, and which Klaproth, in his Memoir upon the Mine
ralogy of Cornwall, considered as belonging to the arseniates
of copper ; but, according to the analysis made by Mr. Che-
nevix, with all the care which his extensive knowledge and
extreme zeal for science would naturally lead him to employ,
it appears to be a true arseniate of iron,, containing only a
small quantity of copper ; and even that quantity teems to
 be merely an accidental mixture. As, in the specimens from
 the old mines of Tincroft and Carrarach, the greatest part
of the crystals adhered to vitreous gray copper ore, it is pos
sible that some particles of that ore remained attached to the
crystals ; or, as I have frequently found to be the cafe, that
some such particles had penetrated into the crystals, and that
 Mr. Klaproth had been thereby deceived, by finding in
the button left by the blowpipe a much greater proportion
of copper than this ore really contains. The natural decom
 position of this arseniate, which produces an oxide of iron of
a sine reddish yellow colour, strongly confirms the result of
 Mr. Chenevix's analysis.
    Gmelin, in his Principles of Mineralogy, printed at Got-
 tingen in the year 1790, had already supposed that these crys
 tals could not belong to the substance which, in mineralogical
 publications, had been called arsenical copper ore.       He had
 consequently separated them, leaving them, however, among
 the ores of copper, under the name of ivUrfel ertz.
    The double combination of the arsenic acid with iron and
 copper, although it had appeared to exist in the arseniate
•just spoken of, in the mines of Tincroft and Carrarach, had
 not excited the attention of mineralogists.        It is however
           that the transparency, the brilliancy, and the pale
   lue colour of its crystals, might occasion them to be mistaken
 Eossible
 for crystals of a stony nature.    Besides, their smallness might

easily cause them to escape the notice of common observa
tion, particularly when they are not in pretty large groups.
   The matrix of these two arseniates is exactly the fame as
that of the arseniates of copper; consisting, like that, of
quartz, mixed with yel|ow, gray, and vitreous ores of cop
per, with oxides of iron, and with mispickel.    The mines
of Hiiel Gorland and Muttrcll, although not situated in the
district of the tin mines, have yet produced some specimens
of tin, the crystals of which are covered with those of the
arseniate here spoken of.  Two specimens of this kind are in
the collection of Sir John St. Aubyn.
                 Species    I.
                           Simple Arseniate of Iron.
   This species crystallizes in perfect cubes, (fig. 28.); some
times, though rarely, they are a little flattened ; their sides are
smooth and brilliant.
   The only modification I have observed in this form           that     is,
four of the eight solid angles of the cube are replaced           an      by
equal number of equilateral triangular planes, situated in such
a manner, that every one of the sides of the cube becomes
an elongated hexagon, having two angles of 900 each, and
four of 135°. (Fig. 29.)      Crystals modified in this way are
very scarce.     have never seen but one such specimen, which
                 I
   in the collection of Sir John St. Aubyn.         The crystals of
it is
   are pretty large, and very well defined.

                                                      is
isjust sufficient to scratch calcareous spar. Its crystals, which
are tolerably transparent, are of       dark green colour, with a
                                                 a
brownisti tinge sometimes they are rather yellowish
                    ;                                            and     ;
there exist some specimens of           brown yellow cosour like
                                                 a
resin.     have never seen this species in any other state than
            I
that of perfect crystallization.
   Sometimes, indeed,        decomposition takes place, which
                                     a
causes the crystals to pass into the state of pulverulent oxide,
                                                           a

which appear in the crystals of the spathose ores of iron
when they have passed into        similar state of decomposition.

these crystals,     I  have not yet been able to determine the
measure of their angles.             The prism is terminated at each of
its extremities by a tetraedral pyramid, which is pretty stiarp;
aud its planes, which are scalene triangles, unite by pairs,
 forming elongated ridges, which join the acute edges of the
 prism : in the other direction, they unite, also by pairs, so as
 to fqrm a ridge which is less elongated, and joins the obtuse
 edges.     Very often the obtuse edges of the prism are replaced
 by planes (of greater or less extent) equally inclined upon
 the adjacent ones. (Fig. 31.)              Sometimes the acute edges
 are also replaced in the same manner, but always by planes
 of less  extent.    (Fig. 3a.)
     The    above    are the only varieties I have observed of this
 arfeniate.     Its crystals seldom occur singly, being generally
  grouped together, in a very irregular manner; sometimes,
  however, they are so united as to assume a mamillated form,
  having the pyramids of the crystals which compose the ma-
 millæ all placed upon the surface thereof.
      The specific gravity os this arfeniate is 3,400.
      Its hardness is rather greater than that of the simple arfe
  niate of iron : it scratches calcareous spar with greater faci
  lity, but does not scratch fluor spar, or heavy spar.
      Its colour is that of a very faint sky-blue ; sometimes the
  blue colour is a little deeper. I have seen some crystals which
  had the fame brown resin colour as the preceding speciesj
  but they are very rare.
      Hitherto I have never met with this species in any other
  form than that of a perfect crystal.

     X HE     endless diversity which the hand of Nature has dif
   fused through all her works, even when she makes use of the
   same primitive materials, must sufficiently convince us, that,
   whatever accuracy we may attain in the knowledge of the
   latter, the means which she employs to form her combina
   tions are still secret. The intellectual eye may indulge in the
   contemplation of hypothetic systems, which itself has cre

 1^2                 Analyjis of the Arsemalet
 must they    ever  be from truths evident to our fenses, and
 supported  by palpable experiments!
    To follow Nature through    the minutiae of her labours, and
 behold her reproducing the fame primitive materials in many
 different shapes, has always been deemed a less splendid
 achievement of science, than to discover one more of those
 simple substances, by the union of which she forms the com
 plicated effects we daily admire.    Yet to me it appears, that
in no instance is she more truly wonderful than in the un
 bounded variety which she has sometimes produced from a
small fund of original resources, and when we can fairly
 follow a few primitive substances through a series of com
 binations infinitely multiplied.
    In addition to the two chemists who, as is mentioned in
 the preceding paper by the Count de Bournon, appear to
 have had some knowledge of the existence of a natural arse-
niate of copper, I must name M. Vauquelin.          In a letter to
 me last year, he communicated the discovery of such a sub
stance in France. Of the different varieties which these gen
tlemen, Messrs. Klaproth, Proust, and Vauquelin, have exa
mined, I sliall have occasion to speak in the course of these
experiments : but it was reserved for the Count de Bournon
to state, in the said paper, with his usual talent and perspi
cuity, the scientific detail of the external characters, parti
cularly of the crystalline forms, by which he had identified
their nature. The free access to the extensive collections of
the Right Hon. Charles Greville and of Sir John St. Aubyn,
also the easy communication with the native soil of this mi
neral, were the peculiar advantages, which enabled the Count
de Bournon and myself to pursue the mineralogical and che
mical researches which are stated in these communications to
the Society.
    When the Count de Bournon had completed what ap
peared to him to be the mineralogical classification of these
copper ores, he gave me some specimens of each kind, num
bered indiscriminately, for the very purpose of excluding pre
judice; and it was not till my task was ended that we com
pared our observations.      If I had been admitted into any
previous knowledge of the arrangement dictated to him by
the principles of crystallography, I mould have been afraid
that I had inertly thought true what I wished to be so. But
I can,  most conscientiously, indulge in the satisfaction which
the according results of different means to prove the fame
proposition naturally excite; and which is justly due to the
truth of the outward marks, however delicate, yet (till to be
                                                       perceived,

perceived, that Nature has left visible to those who will ob
serve her.
     I shall now proceed to offer the result of a chemical ana
lysis, undertaken with a view to determine what confidence
the crystallographical arrangement, adopted in the preceding
paper, might merit ; and to (how how far sciences so nearly
allied may receive new light and confirmation from reciprocal
aid.
    I shall confine myself to detail only those general processes
which, upon frequent trial, have been found preferable.                      By
reducing to powder any of the arseniates of copper here spoken
of, and then exposing them to heat in a platina crucible, the
water of crystallization was quickly dissipated.                   But, as too
great a degree of heat volatilized some portion of the arsenic*
acid, it was found necessary to moderate the heat ; and, in,
order that every particle of water might be finally expelled,
to prolong it.        When the diminution of weight was ascer
tained, the residuum was dissolved in acetous, or, still better,
in dilute nitric acid, and nitrate of lead was poured in. Arse-
niate of lead and nitrate of copper were thus formed, by
 double decomposition ; but, when more nitric acid had been
used than was strictly necessary to dissolve the arseniate of
 copper, no precipitate appeared till the liquor had been eva
 porated.       When the evaporation was pustied too far, part of
 the nitric acid, contained in the soluble nitrate of copper,
 flew off; and that nearly insoluble cupreous nitrate, first
    * There is no doubt that philologists, who do not consider the princi-        '
 pies of the new methodical nomenclature, may, at first sight, think the
term arsenic objectionable ; particularly     as previous custom and analogy
 had given another denomination, arsenical, which is the natural adjective
 of the substantive arsenic. They may say that the difference of accentu
 ation alone marks the distinction between the substantive and the new ad
 jective.  But every chemist will set the weightier considerations of method
 and order before such objections.         In French, the termination in ic, for
 the substantive, and in ique, for the adjective, obviates all confusion.   One
 remark 1 (hall beg leave to offer to the consideration of those chemists who
 have laboured to adapt to the English language a literal translation of the
 French nomenclature.        It is the genius of the former language to throw
 the accent as far back as possible; so that, in trisyllabic*! nouns, the first
 or second syllable is usually accented ; while, in tiie French language, the
 accent is generally thrown upon the last ; thus, we hy/ulptun'c arid, but
 they s*y acide sulpburique.      It was very natural therefore, as in the latter
 cafe, to make the accented syllable be tint which stio-jM denote the parti
 cular state of the substance of which they speak.       Thus, sulpburique, ful-
 pbureux; nilrique, nitre ux \ sulphate, sulphite; nittdle, nitrite.        But,
 without offending the radical orthoepy of our language, we cannot make
 the fame method subservient ro that purpose; for, whin we wish to mark
 the distinction in that manner, we are obliged to wrest the word from its
 proper pronunciation,    and to fay, nitric, nitiotts, sulphureous, &c.
                                                                     mentioned

   inconveniences, alcohol was added, immediately before the
   liquor was quite evaporated, and long after the precipitate
   had begun to appear; in a few minutes, all the arfeniate of
  lead fell to the bottom, while the nitrate of copper was held
   in solution. These new products being separated by filtra
   tion, the spirituous liquor was distilled ; and, from the nitrate
   of copper, the quantity of that metal contained in the ore
  was obtained by boiling the solution with potash or soda f.

  to the method prescribed by Bcrthollct.        1 know of no other.     It is not
  that I have any predilection for those identical terms ; yet, whatever me
  lioration subsequent improvement may introduce in particular cases, if
  principles are to be adopted, they should, in general, be strictly adhered
 to.     But it must be a violation of them to apply a word, appropriated by
• common consent to design a pure, and as yet a simple substance,         to such
  heterogeneous mixturts as lapis causticus, carbona'es of potash and soda,
 &c.      It is indeed much to be desired, that the epithets caustic, pure, sa
 turate, &c. should be regarded as tautology, which they really are. There
 is no potath purer than potash.       When it is not pure, we should sav, in
 stead     of " I took so much potash,"' " I took so much of a mixture of
 potash, and whatever other substance is mixed with it."        Thus, instead of
 calling lapis causticus, caustic potash, or poinfh, as is often done, we
 ihould fay, " I took so much of the mixture of potash, sulphate, muriate,
 carbonate, and sulphuret of potash ; siliceous and aluminous earths ; iron
 and manganese ;" for such I find, by analysis, lapis causticus to be. To
 ail this is added, by apothecaries, a little lime.     Yet this is the substance
 sometimes called potash.
     M. Lowitz's manner does not give potash pure enough for delicate ana
 lyses ot stones.       I have never seen any prepared by his method, in which
 I could not discover iron, silica, alumina, and carbonic acid. To the proofs
 given by Dr. Kennedy, (in his paper intituled " A Chemical Analvsis of
 three Species of VVhinstone and two of Lava," in the Kdinburgh Trans
 actions for 1799,) of the efficacy of his method, 1 propose the following
 objections : That chemist supersaturates bv nitric acid, and examines by
 nitrates of barytes and of silver. This will be a sufficient test for sulphuric
 and muriatic acids j but carbonic acid may have been present before sani
 tation. He then evaporates, and, if all is redissolvable, concludes there is
,"-o silica or alumina; but, after saturation by an acid, ammonia is a more
d-iicite test than evaporation for small portions of those earths.
     By treating Dantzic potash, or, still better, pearlash, with lime, and
evaporating        in a well plated copper vessel, a white mass is left.    This
mass, dissolved as far as it can be in alcohol, and the liquor distilled to
dryness in a plated alembic, gives an alkali of a perfect whiteness.           la
this state it is dangerous to touch it, its action on animal matter is so sud
den and so violent. It attacks all stones with the greatest ease and rapidity.
Dissolved in water, it makes not the least cloud in barytes water, or in a
solution of nitrate or muriate of that earth ; and may be used as a very
delicate and sensible reagent, to distinguish it from strontian.        By satu
rating with an acid, and then seeking silica or alumina, by a nnioma, no
trace of them can be found, nor indeed of any thing else.          I do not say,
however, that the potash is perfectly free from tvery other Jjbstance ;         I
                                                                          believe.

    To the use of alcohol, in order to get rid of the excess of
acid, as mentioned above, there is not the fame objection
that there might be to evaporation, or to an alkali : it can
combine with that acid only which is free; and an excess of
it can, in no way, affect the metallic salts.
    I have given the preference to lead, above every other me
thod of combining arsenic, to determine its quantity in any
other body, having found arscniate of lime, which has
been hitherto recommended, as well as all other earthy arfe-
niates, to be nearly as soluble in water as sulphate of lime.
Lead presented also much facility as to the proportions of its
arseniates; and a few experiments, instituted to arrive at
them, afforded sufficient accuracy. But, first, it was neces
sary to ascertain how much acid a given quantity of metallic
arsenic could afford; and, finding that it was in vain to aspire
at a greater degree of precision than that which Mr. Proust
had obtained, I have adopted his results.             By them it ap
pears, that 133 of white oxide and 153 of acid, contain each
100 of real arsenic, the rest being oxygen.              But, 100 of
metallic arsenic, acidified by nitric acid, neutralized by an
alkali, and precipitated by nitrate of lead, gave 463 of arsc
niate of lead ; that          is,
                           100 of arscniate of iead contain 33 and
a  fraction of arsenic acid     and, on the other hand, my own

experiments    informed    me,    that lead, dissolved in nitric acid,
and precipitated        arscniate of ammonia, gave

care and attention ; for I thought, (hat to differ from so great
a master must be to differ from truth j but I constantly found
21 of water, and 21 of arsenic acid.
    This apparent difference must, therefore, depend on the
state of dryness in which he obtained his acid ; or perhaps
he estimated it with the water ; and, if so; I am happy to
find I agree with him so near as one per cent. A greater
precision, as every person familiar with analysis well knows,
is not within the power of chemical exactness.

of
    T   is well known, that on the borders of lakes, the banks
     broad rivers, and the (Lore of bays, a certain optical illu
sion often takes place when the spectator is stationed in a high
point of view. The opposite bank, under certain circum
stances, is seen as it were floating in the air ; and this phæno-
menon is ascribed to refraction : but in my opinion it proceeds
from     a  different cause.
     About two years ago I observed the phænomenon in                   ques
tion in one of those extensive turf moors that occur so                  often
among the heights in Bremerlande, through which I was
then travelling.          The trees which bordered this moor, to
wards the horizon, appeared to me to be floating in the air.
I at first conjectured, according to analogy, that there must
be a lake or river at the end of the turf moor ; but the postil
lion who drove the carriage assured me that this was not the
cascv
     In  the month      of July this year, being in the fame district,
I  saw    a similar phænomenon, and under circumstances which
induced me to examine it with more attention.                       I was on
the road between Bremervorde and Brederkesa, proceeding
in a north-east direction.              It was about nine in the morning ;
the heavens were covered with light clouds, vet the fun ap
pealed through them a little behind me on the right, and
over a turf moor which extended to the horizon, and was bor
dered with a row of trees.              When the phænomenon first ap
peared,      1 was   travelling    down    an eminence on a road adjacent
to the edge of the moor, which entered it a little way, and
then proceeded up an opposite hill.                The variations which I
observed in the phænomenon as I advanced slowly down the
hill, induced me to dismount, that I might be able every now
and then to turn back. What I observed on this occasion was
as follows :
     At the moment when I was about to descend, I could see
 and observe from the highest point of the hill a very large
surface of the turf moor, which extended itself with increasing
breadth towards the horizon ; the distance of which I esti
mated at a German mile.                   From this pretty high point of
light, I could perceive that the trees at the extremity of the
moor did not Hand exactly in a line, but that thev formed a
 iort of wood, which extended backwards on the other side,

the interval of the trees of the first row was bounded by the
surface of the turf moor, and I imagined that I saw the hea
vens between this extreme surface of the moor and the row
of the most distant trees.
                                         I
                                             ^
    It was at this moment I alighted : then turned back, as
cended the hill a little, and saw the trees which attracted my
attention gradually assume their former appearance. The
whole separated part again sunk down tothe«arth, recovered
their former dark colour, and also their former height; so
that I was scarcely able to distinguish this part from the re
mainder of the row. Some traces, however, of the former
transformation remained. I was therefore induced to examine
the whole row throughout with the greatest attention ; and, on
doing so, I imagined that I observed some parts which lay a
little more in the back ground, and which, as 1 conjectured
from certain signs, would appear transformed in the like
manner when viewed from a somewhat low point of sight.
In regard to the lowest ground line of the row of trees, it
appeared, on account of the distance and thickness of the
atmosphere, too undefined to perceive bendings in it : I was
not able to observe the trunks of the trees, which I distinguish
ed from the surface of the moor merely by its brown colour
being rendered less pale by the intervening stratum of air,
by the trees having a higher position, and by their being seen
through a purer stratum os the atmosphere. On again defend
ing, 1 saw those parts of the row which I considered as the
most remote, gradually raise themselves above the horizontal
plain ; so that they separated themselves from the row in
which they stood, and seemed to float in the air behind the
row which now had the appearance of being broken. When
I  reached the valley, where I was however somewhat elevated
above the level of the moor, these phænomena began to
appear in the foremost row, where the lirst breaking appeared.
I again thought I saw the heavens below the trees at the ex-
                              K3                            treme

                *
  I^a                On the apparent Elevation
  treme edge    of the moor. These trees also appeared to be
  floating in the air, but they did not elevate themselves above
  the ground so much as those I first observed.     As I advanced
  further in the valley, my horizon did not any more change in
  a perceptible manner; though my position in regard to cer
  tain parts of the row of trees was considerably altered, which
  produced several modifications of the phænoir.enon.           The
  elevation of the trees above the horizontal surface increased
  the further I proceeded, but gradually decreased in those parts
  from which I receded, and where it had first begun, and at
  length the whole disappeared when I ascended the opposite
  hill.
     This circumstance of the pbænomenon             led me to an
  observation, from which I concluded that refraction had
  no share in it.       The masses of the distant trees which
  raised themselves from the ground, were situated between
  parts of the foremost row, which for a considerable time did
  not change their position ; and these unchanged parts gave
  me fixed points, by which I was enabled to estimate the ele
  vation of the objects ; and it was this estimation which con
  ducted me to a knowledge of the nature of the phenomenon.
     The intervals where, in consequence of mv progreflive
  motion forwards, the heavens appeared under the most di
  stant trees, raised themselves more the lower mv station
  became on the hill, and the further I advanced in the valley:
  but the summits of the floating trees were not elevated ; on
  the contrarv, they seemed somewhat depressed in comparison
  of the foremost trees. The masses became stiortened below,
  but at the top they remained on the fame level.        I had suffi
  cient opportunity to confirm this circumstance, as, by chan
  ging my position in a vertical and horizontal direction, I saw
  three different masses so totally disappear, that, in the interval
  ¦which they before occupied in the row of trees, nothing
  more was to be seen but the pure heavens. On one of thele
  masses disappearing in this manner, when I retired back from
  my position, there tlrll appeared towards the heavens some
  brown spots, which were the highest summits of the trees ;
  and the more I receded, the more it seemed as if a curtain
  dropped down which concealed           the part of the heavens
-
  before seen.    But   with  whatever attention I looked towards
  the spot where this curtain fell down, and where the sum-
  mits"of the trees at length disappeared, I could observe nothing
  but the pure heavens.      Had a person, without suspecting any
  thing   ot this optic  transformation,   seen from the vallev the
  row of trees in the horizon evidently broken, and had again
  iuen from the hill without observing the gradual change
           6                                                  during

 in the rays of light reflected from the vapours, which in con
 sequence of this reflection appear so dazzling to the eye, that
 they conceal the objects situated below, and present the same
appearance as the heavens.         The fun, as already said, was
 towards that fide where I saw the phenomenon, and his al
 titude was considerable, as I observed the above transformation
on the 18th of July, between the hours of 9 and jo. While
 I observed from the valley several of these broken parts of the
first row of trees, the fun was in a perpendicular direction
over them. The elevation of the masses above the ground in
creased in general more and more as my situation became
gradually lower, and according as each mass of the objects
to be changed approached nearer to a perpendicular position
under the fun, in consequence of my advancing in a hori
zontal direction. As I descended, I had between me and the
objects a stratum of the atmosphere, which was always denser,
and consequently more proper for reflecting the rays.       When
I advanced the.
             in      horizontal  plain, this reflection took place
more in a straight line ; and when 1 came into such a position
that the vapours threw back the rays of light to the level of
the summits of tiie moll distant trees, I saw nothing but this
luminous vapour, which lost itself in the heavens, and formed
with them one continued field. When I had reached the
lowest point of the plain, where I found a favourable point of
view, some of the foremost trees could then raise themselves
from the ground, because they were nearer to me ; and to com
pensate for this greater proximity, the rays of light must
have penetrated a much thicker stratum of the atmosphere,
and must have proceeded from a point so much nearer the
perpendicular position under the fun.
    The presence of the sun is the principal condition of this
                               K4                  phænoinenon    :

  15 1         Elevation of Objcfts  above the Horizon.
  phænomenon : without the action of the sun's beams, the
  vapours would not be dense enough to conceal the objects :
  it is by means of the solar rays that they are made to disap
  pear from the eye.     These rays, however, can be transmitted
   to the eye only under a given angle, in the same manner as
   a certain angle is required in order to produce the rainbow by
   refraction.   The stratum of air which is sufficiently dense to
  effect this reflection of the fun, rises to a certain height, but
  it can be perceptible to the eye only when the vapours ac
  tually throw back a great number of rays. As soon as the
  point of sight corresponding to this effect is obtained, the eye
  fees only the shining vapour, which it cannot distinguish
  from the heavens.      This disappearance, however, takes place
  in regard to distant as well as to near objects, and rather at
-the lower than the upper part of the object, because, in the
  first case, the direction of the line of fight passes through a
  larger mass of vapour, and in the second through a denser
  stratum.     The less dense part of the vapour, which did not
  reflect rays of the fun, but which always grew denser the
  lower my station became, acting like a veil, which interposed
  itself between my eye and the trees which had not yet disap
  peared, made me observe their distance, and contributed to
 cause the elevated trees to appear asif floating behind the row.
      In regard to the circumstance that the tops of the distant
 trees did not raise themselves above those of the foremost,
 though their lower parts seemed to rise above the ground as I
 descended, and that these tops on the contrary seemed some
 what depressed; it arose from the decrease in the elevation
  of my point of station having a greater ratio to the less di
  stant than to the most distant trees; by which means, the
 former were raised more in the same proportion above the
 horizon.
     When this phænomenon is           observed   on the banks of
 large pieces of water, and when        the objects are at different
 distances from the observer, the truth of the principles here
 advanced may he confirmed by remarking, that the phæno
 menon is modified by a change of position ; but if the ob
 server can move about in a horizontal direction, it will be of
 great use to observe the changes of the object in a vertical
 direction, supposing he has opportunity, on any gradual de
 clivity, of ascending and descending.         If the vertical mea
 surement of the objects then changes, so that their total
 height decreases the more the objects seem to rife from the
 ground when the observer descends the declivity, this is a
 sufficient proof that the whole image is not elevated, but that
                                                                 its

bodies   above the horizon, while they are actually below                                    i
we may easily conceive that the rays of light, proceeding in
an oblique direction, sometimes pass through rarer and some
times through denser strata of the atmosphere.          But, in the
present case, there      no difference in the specific denseness or
                                is
rarity, and the corresponding power of refraction of the
medium through which the ray of light            transmitted to the  is
eye; and       an actual elevation takes place
               if                                    refraction, the       by
action must be equally great from water or from            lake, and                 a
on the objects opposite to them       consequently the whole mass
                                                  :
of these object? must appear equally elevated, without any in
terruption being observed in them.
 I    shall here add, that      have been very often deceived ia
                                       I
these moors,        that thought saw at
                      so        I               great distance lakes

the kind. This was always the cafe in the morning, and
when the fun               by
                       standing over the object gave rife to the
illusion. Had not the horizon on these occasions been bor
dered with      arow of small hills,     should certainly have be
                                                      I
lieved that     I saw not only      piece of water, but even the
                                              a
heavens.     The hill prevented me from seeing at one view the
heavens and the luminous vapour, and the vapour seen alone
appeared to me as an extended piece of water illuminated by
the reflection of the heavens.

goat    at  its   different     ages,  and  has  not described the female,
which       isstill unknown.          All these reasons have induced me
to make researches respecting this inhabitant of our lofty
Alps, and            flatter myself that         sliall render      service to
                                                                            a

    Having learned that M. de Watteville, governor of l'Aigle
in the Pays de Vaud, had in his possession                  live young goat,
                                                                   a
I  eagerly    embraced         that  opportunity,    and  undertook      jour       a
ney to l'Aigle to describe and make                     drawing of it. (See

   The wild goat of l'Aigle, the first time         saw      in theI              it,
spring of 1784, was two years of age.         came from the val

                 On the  Wild Goat of   the  Alps.            15$
and muscles, seemed to show its strength and its means of
defence.
    On the first view, it had some resemblance to the sheep in.
regard to the head, but in the whole of its figure it had more
relation to the goat. In comparing it with the latter, it appear
ed larger and thicker; its forehead was narower and more
elevated. These last characters distinguished it from all animals
of the fame kind. Its head was proportionally smaller, the fore
head was a little arched before, the eye was quick and of a
moderate size, the pupil contracted in the fun like that of the
sheep, forming a rectangle, the base of which Hood in the
direction of the greatest length of the eye ; the forehead and
upper part of the head were thickly covered with hair; it had
no vestige of beard.    But on my second visit fix months atter,
that is to fay, when it was two years and a half old, it had a
final! one at the distance of an inch and a half from the. ex
tremity of the muzzle ; it was black, and turned backwards.
    Its horns were verv different from those of the goat ; they
¦were large, near each other at the roots, and at a consider
able distance, at the points; bent back and outwards in an
arch; thev were fourteen inches in length, and eight inches
in circumference at the bait ; the two longitudinal ridges, be-     .
tween which was the anterior face of each horn in lite old
goats, were not both very sensible ; the interior one was the
most perceptible; it had two or three large and very promi
nent tubercles.     These tubercles in the large hums of the
wild goat terminate the transversal ridges of the anterior face;
but here the transversal ridges were not yet distinctly marked,
though they were perceptible. The posterior face of the
horns was round and smooth ; but the second time I saw it
they had considerably increased.      The anterior face and lon
gitudinal ridges  were  well marked.     Near the bale there were
four transversal ridges very prominent, and elevated nearly-
half an inch : on the interior longitudinal ridge there were
fix tubercles, and the others went on decreasing to more than
 half the length of the horn.
    The animal was then three feet and a half in length : it ap
 peared to me proportionally higher on the Iclts than the goat;
but this was on account of its being not then well formed,
for the old wild goat has stiort legs in proportion to its
 length : it had a thicker and shorter neck than the goat, the
 rump was lighter and rounder, the body more plump, and
 the legs thicker ; it had no callosities on the knies, which
 in the common goats is one of the marks of its domesticity:
 its ears were large, almost bare in the inside; but the edges
•were furnished with whitish       hairs:  the animal  always di
rected them backwards.
                                                                 It

     It had two kinds of hair : one a white down, very thick,
 frizzled and woolly ; and large hair, very coarse and thick
 on the whole body. It was longer under the neck, and
 on the anterior parts in general ; it had not, like the com
 mon goat, a sort of mane of long hair on the backj the hair
 on the body was of a shining gray fawn colour, and that
 below the chin, darker than that on the body, inclined to
 brown.      At the lower part of the flanks there was a stripe of
 browner hair which began about the thigh, and extended on
the side as in some species of the antelope ; the belly and in
side of the four legs were white or whitish.                     That black
stripe   on  the  spine  found  in all  wild    goals   was    not    observed
on this animal in the spring ; but in the month of October it
reappeared, beginning at the distance of about four inches
from the root of the norns, and extending to the tail. The
black stripe at the lower part of the flanks was also better
marked, and the hair of the body was of a brownish gray
colour ; the hair on the parts below the tail was white, as -in
the greater part of antelopes.             The tail itself was brown
above and white beneath ; it was very short, and covered with
longhair: the hair of the body was directed towards the
rump, and that on the thighs downwards.                       The hoofs of
this animal were very long ; the fore legs were sensibly thicker
than those behind, and the thighs were strong and fleshy; its
feet were of a rounder form than those of the goat, and better
determined ; each hoof had a sort of talon very apparent ; the
lower face of the hoofs which touches the ground was con
cave, and terminated by a salient edge, principally on the
outside, as in the chamois. The horn of the hoofs was pliable
and elastic, and equally durable as those of the sheep.

    Aster having described the wild goat of l'Aigle, I {hall now
give some remarks on wild goats in general..
    The length of the horns varies. D'Aubenton gives the
dimensions of a pair of horns preserved in the king's collection,
which were 2 feet 9 inches in length, and 9 inches in cir
cumference at the roots ; they had 20 rings or ridges : this is
the greatest length known of the horns ofthis animal. Their
distance from each other varies also. Sometimes they diverge
a great deal, at others very little ; theircolour is reddisti or
blackish, but when the animal becomes old they assume a
dirty white colour.
    It is to be observed, that on the large horns of the wild goat
the largest and most prominent transversal ridges and tubercles
are towards the roots.      This may be easily conceived, if atten
tion be paid to the increase of this kind of horns, which takes
place at the bottom ; that is to fay, the increase of each year
          upwards that of the preceding year, so that the young
  torns at the end of some years form the upper part of the large
[lushes
ones: and as these horns always acquire more size and breadth
at the bottom, the transversal ridge or ring of each year be
                                   '
comes always less prominent.
    The young are brought forth covered with their first
woolly hair, Dut in autumn they beginto be clothed with
their long and stiff hair : the horns appear in the first month,
and the animal immediately acquires the black stripe on the
spine.
    In spring, towards the month of May, all the young and old
goats change their hair; that on the back thev lose first,
and that on the thighs last : the black stripe disappears in
moulting time, and afterwards re-appears, as we have ob
served: thev then acquire red hair inclining to yellow, which,
as the season advances, becomes dark brown mixed with gray ;
so that in the month of September they are almost entirely of
that colour, or at least the upper parts of" the bodv, but in win-
tor and towards spring their hair becomes reddish gray.            The
belly remains white, and the black stripe is always seen in
the flanks : on growing old they become gray.
    The hunters can tell the age of the wild goats by the num
ber of transversal ridges on the anterior face of the horns.
Every year they fay one is produced ; and it is bv these alone
that the age can be determined, and not by the other knots
er wrinkles with which        the    horns ar^ covered.       But this
            4                                                  method

  158              On the   Wild Goat of   the Alps.
 method in my opinion is not very certain, since the wild goat
 ofTAigle, when I saw it in the month of October 1784, had
 four transversal ridges, and two large and extensive knots,
 ¦which were to form ridges.        According to the calculation of
the hunters, therefore, this animal ought to have been four or
 five years of age, and yet it is certain that it was only twa
 years and a half.      Hence, it is not by the horns that the age
 of the   wild  goats can be determined with certainty, but By
means     of the  teeth, as is done in regard to sheep.
     It appears that the wild goat lives to a very great age, but
 not so long as might be supposed from the report of the hunt
ers; for, according to them, it grows to the age of fourteen or
 fifteen ; and as it is known that all animals live seven times
 the period of their growth, it would thence follow, that the
 wild goat might attain to the age of ninety-eight or one
 hundred and live vears.       We shall soon see that this calcula
tion is very much exaggerated.
     From what I have already said, it is evident that the hunt
 ers are mistaken when they fay that the wild goat grows to
the. age of fourteen or fifteen: what has led them into an
error is the number of transversal ridges, which is always
greater than the number of years, and consequently has
made the animal appear older than it really was.
     Another method, therefore, must be employed to deter
mine the period of their growth.           The wild goat is not ca
pable    of producing   its species before the age of two years, or
two years and a half: if that of l'Aigle produced at the age
of two years, this ought, perhaps, to be ascribed to the more
abundant nourishment with which it was supplied in its state
of servitude, which hastened prematurely its procreative fa
culties.     And, as it is known that quadrupeds cannot en
gender     before   the time when they have nearly attained to
their full growth, we may presume, with some sort of founda
tion, that the wild goat grows to the age of four years, and
perhaps more.        This will give 28 or 30 years for the dura
tion of its life, which, in my opinion, is much more natural
than that assigned by the hunters.
     The horns increase in length almost during the whole life
of the animal, but in size it grows only till the age of 15 or
16 vears.      The largest have 20 or 30 transversal ridges.
     The female wild goat, called vulgarly itagne, is a third
less than the malet it is also thinner, and less fleshy.         Its
horns have very little relation to those of the male wild goat;
they are like those of the common goat, and are very small :
I have seen some at Chamonix which were only eight inches
.u length.      They have no anterior face; and, like those of
                                                                the

differences which appear to exist between our wild goats and
those of Siberia ; the males of which have always a very large
beard, and the females a small one.
    The wild goat has different cries ; the most common is a
short shrill whistle, very like that of the chamois, but with
this difference, that the whistle of the latter is longer : some
times it makes a noise by breathing through its nostrils ; and,
when young, it has a small kind ot bleating, which it loses as
it grows old.
   The wild goat which I              Aigle was exceedingly gentle
                                      saw at    1'
 and tame : its attachment to the common goat, which suckled
it it,
     was very strong, though       no longer sucked       often when
                                          it                      :
    was on the top of the house, or in other places inaccessible
 to the common goat, and when the latter seemed uneasy,
 and called to         it   by
                     her bleating,      immediately returned.

 beheld   itwith admiration, in one of the interior courts of
 the castle of PAigle, at two leaps mount           wall, without

it wished to reach, parallel to the wall along which it intended
to proceed,,  and examined it with great attention ; then, as
if it had renounced its design, it began to traverse, with slow
Jeps, the court in which it was confined ; but, returning
from time to time, it took its station opposite to the place it
had in view ; and sometimes balanced itself on its hind legs,
as if to try their elasticity : at last, having repeated this pre
paration, for some time, it at once formed its resolution,
darted itself forwards, leaped along the wall as already men
tioned, and soon reached the spot it intended. It has been
seen standing on the upper edge of a door.          It chose for its
lodging a place under the roof of the highest tower in the
castle.
    This animal was not mischievous; and if it often presented
its horns, it was only that they might be scratched, of which
it seemed very fond. It knew those who scratched                  and       it,
often presented its head to them for that purpose.          When                  it
wislied to strike with its horns,         never dies so directly for
                                                it
wards, but     by rising up on its hind legs and striking sidewise.
    As occasioned some damage by its leaping about, was
          it                                                                it
found necessary to tie its legs. This state of restraint appeared
to me to have had an influence on its physical constitution,
as   itafterwards became meagre.        Born to enjoy liberty, this
animal cannot endure confinement:            should even have ima-

        that   apart of its docility arose from its weakness, had
fined
   not known that this gentle and sociable animal can be easily
tamed. The following trait, which shows how susceptible
it    of being tamed, deserves to be known
     is                                                       :
    A guide of Chamonix, being employed to conduct to
Chantilli, for the menagerie of the prince of Conti, two wild
goats which he had reared, they followed him merely through
their attachment to him.        When he arrived near the town
of Befancon, they were frightened                    by
                                                herd of cows, im

mediately betook themselves to flight, climbed up the steepest
rocks in the neighbourhood, and abandoned their guide, who
was under great embarrassment: he, however, went after
them, and, having called to them, they soon returned, and
followed him as before.

XXIX.         Account ofthe "Results os some comparative Experi
    ments made     with the Teylerian Ele&rical Apparatus and
    Folia's    Metallic Pile.   By Van Marum and Pfaff.
    Communicated          lo Professor          Volt a        in a Letter dated No~
    vember j8oi.           Abridged          by      Luke Howard, Esq. from
   Journal     de   Chimic         by   J.      B. Fan Moris *.
A       PILE of 200 pairs of metals was constructed in the
 usual method of Volta.     The metals employed were Dutch
 three florin pieces of nearly i! inch in diameter, and corre
 spondent pieces of zinc.     The first experiments were directed
 to charging the jars of a large battery containing 5J square
 feet of coated surface a-piece.   A single jar was first charged,
afterwards different numbers connected, and successively aug
mented to 25. sn sithe rst, and in each succeeding experiment,
the charge was effected by mere contact for as little time as
possible with the pile.    The discharge in every case produced
a divergence    of the gold leaves in Bennet's electrometer,
amounting to Jths of an inch, which was also found to be
the degree of intensity (tension) of the pile itself.
    The whole coated surface of 137* square feet was next
charged, at several times, by a pile augmented at each charge.
With 40 pairs of metals, the divergence of the electrometer
was perceptible.      The increased divergence caused by the
      itself at each addition, was equally producible          the            by
  Eile                       it. No difference was perceived in
                                   by
  attery when charged
the effects of the negative and positive states of the battery
in this respect.
   The  sensations producible                   by
                                the discharges under the last-
mentioned arrangements were as follow                         :
   With 20 pairs of metals, the passage of electricity was sen
sibly felt in both hands, each being wetted, and grasping                          a
copper conductor of     inches diameter. Sixty pairs affected
                               2
the elbows. With 200, strong (hocks were received, extend
ing to the shoulders.   They concluded that the force of the
battery in this respect was in all cases only half that of the
pile; which indeed was to be expected.
   They next proceeded to      comparative examination of the
                                            a
charge  communicable               by
                            momentary contact of the battery
with the conductor of an electrical irlass plate apparatus of
31 inches diameter.      Precautions were used to secure the
conductor from receivings more than         momentary charge  a
from the plate.       was found,

l6i                Exptriments in Electricity
repetitions of the contact were required to bring the charge
or the battery to that degree of intensity which the pile com
municated at one.
    Thev were of opinion that the sensation of the discharge
differed nothing at equal intensities, whether the battery were
charged by the pile or the plate apparatus.        In short, they
consider the two as mere exciters of the fame electricity ; and
consequently, that the supposed galvanic fluid has no existence
distinct therefrom.
     Van Marum observes, that the rapidity of the current of
electricity in the pile mult be inconceivable, since, by a con
tact lasting only i-20th of a second, it will charge com
pletely 137 square feet of surface; an effect exceeding, in his
opinion, the power of every known electrical apparatus, ex
cept the large one in the Teylerian mulæum !
    This pile was very carefully insulated on a plate of gum
lac, and supported in its vertical position by sticks of sealing-
wax.     Cloth soaked in solution of muriate of ammoniac was
used to separate the pairs of metals.
    They constructed a second pile with 5-inch square plates
of copper and zinc. This proved much more powerful when
arranged in 32 pairs perpendicularly, than when, by laying
down four pieces in contact at once, the height was reduced to
eight pairs, and the surface in each quadrupled. The former
pile melted five inches of No. 16. (iron wire) into globules,
and reddened seven inches. In attempting to carry it higher,
the weight of the superior part, expressing the liquid from the
inferior, destroyed the effect.    They remedied this by con
necting four short piles, and thus obtained the joint action
of no pairs of the latter metals.
     In order to determine whether there exists any perceptible
difference between the spark given by the pile to any conduct
ing body, and that whigh it receives therefrom, " we em
ployed (fays Van Marum) a bowl of quicksilver suitably con
nected by a wire with the superior plate of one of the outside
piles, and we brought to its surface one while the point of
a needle attached to the wire of communication, then the
blunter point of the latter.    We next connected the quick
 silver with the other extremity of the piles, and, repeating
 this several times, we could fee, in one instance, the spark
pass from the conducting wire into the quicksilver, in the
other from the quicksilver to the wire." The result satisfied
 them, that there is not the least perceptible difference be
 tween the positive and the negative sparks : but this trouble
was compensated bv the view ofa very beautiful and interesting
phænomenou.
                  " When we touched (says Van Marum) the
                                                          surface

                              and Galvanism.                                    16$
 surface    the quicksilver with the end of the fine wire, the
           of
 combustion was so strong, that it dispersed on all sides sparkles
 which had the appearance of thousands of rays, constituting
 very fine funs of several inches diameter.    By flowly lower
 ing the wire as it consumes, this spectacle may be continued
 at pleasure.
    The No.    16. wire, of my inch diameter, succeeds most
  certainly ; but wire of T40 inch makes a more brilliant fliow.
  When it is too thick to burn, the sparks form spots of oxide
 on the bright surface of the quicksilver.
    The endof a platina wire, of about T-fT inch diameter, was
 melted into a globule by the discharge.     The sparks given by
 the wire of communication, when the latter was large enough,
 exceeded T\ inch diameter.
    They thought much depended on a proper degree of hu
 midity in the substances interposed between the metals ; and
 they advise a cold saturated solution of muriate of ammoniac
 to be used, in preference, for this pgrpose.
    The intensities of two columns containing an equal num
 ber of plates appeared equal by the electrometer, although'
 their diameters were so Different as 1 [- and 5 inches.      On
 taking several repeated shocks from each, their powers in this
 respect seemed also to be alike.    In the fusion of wire, how
ever, the larger diameter had an evident advantage; which
 was attributed to the greater velocity of the current of elec
tricity flowing through the metah
    By diminishing the diameter of the humid conductors be
tween the plates, the force of the pile was lessened in propor
 tion.   On substituting water, or solution of sea salt, to that
of sal-ammoniac, the same pile which before melted four
inches of wire could not be made to redden a single line.
Whence arises the superior effect of the ammoniacal salt?
Is it because it oxidates the metals more ? It appeared, jn-
deed, that the action of this pile diminished in proportion as
the oxidation of the metals did so : but, on the other hand,
from the result of several comparative experiments with ihe
sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, they conclude that the
prompt oxidation produced by these means is so far from in-
creasing, that it rather lessens the power of the pile in all re
spects.    Neither did ammoniac, which was also tried          a-         sej
ratcly, produce an effect at all comparable to that of the neu
tral salt *. The oxidation os the metals, therefore, although
                                                                                it

    it must be allowed to contribute something to the effect, does
    not exclude the cooperation of some other property which
    may reside in the ammoniac.           This opinion seemed to the
    authors to receive support from a subsequent experiment, in
    which a saturated solution of potash exhibited a decided su-
                over water when both were successively used in the
    Sieriority
      ame pile, although it did not at all tarnish the metals.
        Still further to "elucidate this point, the authors proceeded
    to examine the comparative action of a pile in vacua in oxy-
'
    gen and in other gases.
        Having placed 60 pairs of zinc and silver, with a proper
    metallic communication, under the receiver of an air-pump,
    and exhausted the latter to a pressure of five lines, they found
    the action of the pile in no way changed. Air was admitted,
    and again exhausted, and the pile left in vacuo for an hour,
    the effect still continuing the fame.        Carbonated hydrogen
    was now admitted into the receiver, and, being afterwards
    exhausted, was replaced by azote, without any perceptible
     variation, in either cafe, from the usual appearances. Lastly,
     having again exhausted the receiver, it was filled with oxygen
     gas from manganese.        The shocks now became stronger, and
     the sparks much larger, brighter, and easier to obtain.         On
     exhausting the oxygen they were surprised to find the pile
     now realty affected by the vacuum, and acting with much
     less force than in either of the preceding cafes.      The atmo
     sphere of oxvgen, and the vacuum after             it,
                                                       being once more
     repeated, left no doubt as to the reality of this increase and
     diminution of effect; the pile also returning nearly to its or
     dinary strength on being restored to the atmospheric air.
         The letter concludes with stating the effect of increasing
     the 5-inch square pile to 200 pairs     ;  the discharge of which
     melted 23 inches of wire, and entirely reddened 33 inches;
     also three other experiments, which prove that, in order to
      augment the power of Volta's pile,     it    necessary to increase
                                                   is

     Lu-iu to M. de Dolomieu, to Professor Pictet, of

 Y<     OU request me to give you some particulars respecting
 the valuable friend whom we have just now lost.                      I shall sa
 tisfy   you   with     pleasure,    for   however     afflicting may be the
 recollections which so recent a loss excites every moment, I
experience a kind of satisfaction by communicating them to
a friend filled with the fame sentiments as myself for this
 worthy man.
     Yes, Sir, it was at the moment when lie enjoyed, in the
highest degree, the tender affection of all his friends, when
he called to mind, with pleasure, the particular marks of it
which he had received at Geneva; and when he felt, in the
liveliest manru.r, those testimonies of respect of which he had
been, and still was, the object, that he was suddenly snatched
from his numerous friends.                It was at the moment when he
seemed to have acquired a new zeal for geology, that science
for which Nature makes us pay very dear, since (he does not
suffer her recesses to be explored but at the expense of the
lives of those who have the courage to force their way to her.
You can already reckon two friends among the number of her
victims J.        It was at the moment when he was preparing to
undertake a journey which, as he told me, was to complete
his knowledge, and enable him to render his labours and
researches useful ; in a word, at a moment when his exist
ence became more and more interesting to the sciences,
which he promoted with as much attachment as possible.
He has left very numerous notes respecting his travels and va
rious facts he had observed ; together with some manuscripts
on mineralogy, the fruits of his meditations and captivity.
But these works, however interesting, had need of being ar
ranged and illustrated by the fame spirit which collected the
observations.
     During the three weeks he remained with us, we every
day made a lithologic tour.               I had discovered to him a kind
of treasure in this way, which is found in a small circum
ference around my habitation, and which presents some very

 interesting geological facts; and he had made large collec
 tions for his friends.      He possessed au excellent state of
 health, and we both enjoyed the flrongest reciprocal friend
 ship. He was cheerful, and foresaw no other chagrin than
 that of his speedy departure to Paris, when he was attacked
 by that dreadful malady, of which he had so little expecta
 tion, that, on the forenoon of the day on which he fell ill,
 he asked me where we should go a-mineralizing in the after
 noon.    The violence of the fever first attacked the brain ; and
 we made haste to call- in the assistance of art, but, unfortu
 nately, without success. The first period of the malady pro
 duced agitation and pain : his head was sometimes confused.
 The second period, which may be dated from the 4th day,
 was marked with an almost continual dejection, which al
 ways increased till the last moment.     During the last period
 he experienced no pain ; he found himself easy ; and an hour
 before he resigned his tender and sensible foul into the hands
 of his God, he still said he was well. In a word, he ceased
 to live by an insensible gradation, and like a lamp which
 becomes extinguished for want of aliment.
    However, after he was attacked by the disease he foresaw
 the danger which threatened him ; and he beheld his last
 moment with that coolness and tranquillity which belong to
 great minds, like his own.      He was much more in pain for
 the grief he was about to occasion to his sister, than for his
 own situation ; and the only object of regret which seemed to
 affect him in his last moments was that of not being able to
 bid adieu to all his friends. You, Sir, were among the num
 ber of those for whom he had the greatest affection ; and he
 no doubt testified to you the regret he experienced on hearing
 that you was not to pass this way on your return from Eng
 land.
    If the course of his life has been tempestuous and agitated,
 by troubles occasioned to him in consequence of that jealousy
which always attends merit, his last moments formed a
striking contrast with that agitation; for he gave vent to no
 complaint against those who, by the most rigorous treatment,
 had attacked in him the principle of existence; and his foul
seems to have taken its flight from the world with calmness
and satisfaction, and as if it were smiling at the picture of
Jife which it surveyed at the moment of its departure.
    Madam de Dree and myself learned, with great sensibility,
the proof of attachment which you as well as some of your
countrymen have given to the memory of Dolomieu, in re
questing to be at the expense of having a portrait of that ce
lebrated man engraved from the excellent painting in the pos

and was at the fame time my own.              I have written to him,
that, your wisli in this respect having been the first expressed,
we are far from opposing this impulse of your hearts, so flat
tering to the memory of our common friend.
    In regard to myself, I expect, with the aid of that portrait,
and another very like in the possession of his sifter, to have a
bust formed, which I (hall have the honour of fending you
as a mark of my acknowledgement for the friendship you
testified towards him. And as his dear remains rest with me,
the last granite we broke together is destined to be a tomb,
which will show, till the latest periods, the spot where he em
ployed himself in his last miucralogital labours.
   XXXI.     Notices relative to the Sciences and    Arts in France.
        H E musæum,      the gallery of antiques, and that of Apollo,
in Paris,   are open 10 public view on the 8th, 9th, and 10th
days of    each decade.       The other days are destined for the
 students.    Foreigners,    however,    are admitted daily from ten
 in the morning to four in the afternoon, 011 presenting their
passports ; and this indulgence is extended to all persons
arriving from the provinces, and who are provided with pass
ports. These exhibition's are gratuitous.
    The gallery of Apollo contains the drawings which belong
ed    to the late king.       Five hundred of them, framed and
 glazed, are exhibited at a time. The collection consists of
 about twelve thousand.         Among these are thirty by Raphael,
 and a considerable number by Julio Romano, Titian, Paul
 Veronese, Carachi, and in general by all the great n.asters of
 the three schools.
     Such in Paris is the quantity of pictures brought from
 every part of France and Italy, from Flanders, Brabant,
  Germany, Piedmont, &c. &c. that, to get rid of a part of
 them, fifteen new mufæums are now establishing in as many
 principal cities of France.         In proportion as the buildings
 prepared for them are ready for their reception, the paintings,
 drawings, statues, &c. are forwarded.
     The pictures in the grand musæum in Paris consist, one
 half of the Italian school, one fourth of the Flemish, and one
  fourth of the French.       Besides this, there is a musæum of the
  French   school   in   the Palace   at Versailles.   Twenty of the
 apartments     in the   palace  arc  dedicated  to  this purpose.   In
  addition to the pictures of the French school, there are many
  pthers by the best masters of the Italian and Flemish schools,

    1 here is still a French academy     at Rome.     Three prizes
for painting, sculpture,    and  architecture are awarded     yearly;
-and the three successful candidates      are sent to Rome to re
main there four years at their government's expense.               By
this regulation there are constantly twelve French students
at Rome, each of whom is obliged, in the course of his stay
there, to fend home one production at least. These produc
tions form a part of the musæum of the French school at
Versailles.
    The Paris exhibition of the works of living painters, sculp
tors, and architects, is opened yearly in the months of Sep
tember and October.
    The national library in Paris, comprehending the cabinet
of medals and antiques, is open to public view on the 3d,
6th, and 9th days ot each decade from ten till two o'clock.
The other days, with the exception of that of the decade, are
set aside for the students.       The library consists of about
ninety thousand volumes, and upwards of eighteen thousand
manuscripts, in all languages.       There      is,
                                               besides,    library of

engraved antient and modern music.
    The collection of medals     is immensely rich.      In the year
1800, the entire collection belonginc to Pins VI. was added,
together with     a  great part of his gems, the Ifiac table, and
several Egyptian statues in bronze, bafaltes, granite, &c.
Here are given annually and gratuitously, courses of public
lectures on the Oriental and European languages, chemistry,
natural history, botany, antiquities, mythology, &c.               by
                                                                  the

French by virtue of the last article of the treaty of peace with
the king of Naples: for this purpose two comniitraries have
been sent to Italy ; one of them the son of Chaptal the mi
nister for the home department, the other Dufourny, an ar
chitect.
   The institute for deaf and dumb persons, conducted by
Sicard, is perhaps one of the most useful establishments which
Paris can boast.       The progress made by the pupils under
their able and benevolent professor excites an universal admi
ration.     Masfieu, the favourite of the abbe Sicard, and the
most intelligent of his pupils, acts as second master.      Some
time ago a lady asked him in writing what was gratitude :
to which he replied without hesitation, The memory of the
heart.     It was impossible for any one of the spectators,
gifted with all his fenses, to have replied with more justness,
truth, and delicacy.
   The manufacture of porcelain at Seves, near Paris, is open
daily to public view ; as is also that of the Gobs lins in Paris.
In the latter, a number of artists are now employed in copy
ing in tapestry the most pleasing subjects which can be select
ed ; — landscapes, cattle pieces, pieces of fruit, flowers, &c.
Some of these arc intended for presents ; the others are sold
in proportion as they are finished.
   The national institute of music, which was established in
1793, and which is now styled the conservatory of music, is
under the administration of five persons, who are lodged in the
building, each with a salary of five thousand livres. The
professors, seventy in number, have each a salary of fifteen
hundred livres. The number of pupils, males and females,
amounts to about five hundred.         The prizes arc distributed
annually with great pomp; and the successful candidates
sing or play publicly the pieces which have been crowned
by success. From six to eight concerts are given an
nually, to excite an emulation in the pupils, and to display
 their talents,

XXXII.        Observations    on Maddering    ;  together with ajimflt
   and certain Process       for obtaining,    •with great Beauty and
   Fixity,    that Colour known under the name of the Turkey or
   Adrianople Red.         By   J. M. Haussmann*.
JL HAVE already indicated, in the Annales de Chimief and
the Journal de Physique, that earths and metallic oxides have
more or less the property of attracting; and retaining the
colouring parts of vegetable and animal Tubstances ; alumine
and the oxide of iron poffefs it in a greater degree than the
oxide of tin ; but the attractive force of the latter far surpasses
that of the other earths and metallic oxides in regard to the
colouring parts of the said substances.
    Alumine and metallic oxides do not retain, with the fame
force of adhesion, the colouring parts of all animal and vege
table substances indiscriminately;           that of madder adheres
much stronger than those of the other colouring substances,
which may be classed in the. following order : kermes, co
chineal, logwood, yellow India wood, woad, quercitron,
Brazil wood, red India wood, yellow berries, &c. The gall-
nut, stiumac, and other astringent colouring substances, act
principally bv means of the gallic acid, and, in regard to their
degree of fixity, may be placed immediately after madder :
the cafe is not the fame with the Pruslic acid, which commu
nicates a colour lo different metallic oxides, from which it can
 be separated cold bv alkaline leys.
    To judge of the fixity of colours arising from animal and
vegetable substances, the best method is to employ a lev of
oxygenated muriate of potash or soda, with excess of alkaline
 carbonate. The longer or shorter resistance which the colours
 make in this ley, will indicate what they will make when
 acid, alkaline, saponaceous, and other reagents are employed.
     In the art of dyeing, and that of cotton-printing, the name
 of maddering is given to that process by which the colouring
parts of madder are transferred, by means of water with the
 aid of heat, to alumine, or to the oxide of iron fixed in any
 kind of stuff.
   • From the Annales de Cbimit, No. rsa.
   f   We must here mention, that C. Chapral, minister of the interior, a
 good judge in matters of this kind, when he communicated to us these
 observations, wrote as follows : " C. Haussmann, manufacturer of printed
 cottons at LagleWh, near Colmar, in thje department of the Upper Rhine,

made twenty-five years ago, has given birth to many manu
factories, and improved all those established near waters
which do not run over or hold in solution this earthy
salt, without which it is absolutely impossible to obtain
beautiful and fixed madder colours. This chalk since that
time has become a new objectof commerce ; and as the price
is very moderate, I have not yet determined the just propor
tion to be employed : in general,       I  take one part for four,
five, or fix, of madder.
    In order to obtain the brightest madder colours, it is not
sufficient to attend to the quality of the water and of the in;ut-
der : it is necessary also to observe the degree of the heat of
the bath : a low temperature will check the attraction of the
colouring parts, and prevent them from being extracted,
while one too high will favour the adhesion of the yellow
particles of the madder, which obscure and tarnish the shades
intended to be produced.         The only colour which gains by
increasing the heat is black.        I have always observed, that
on withdrawing the fire from below the boilers, when the
 hand can no longer be held in the aqueous vehicle which
 they contain, if the maddering be then continued for two or
 three hours, the most satisfactory results will be obtained, as
 the furnace still retains a sufficient quantity of heat to main
 tain the vehicle at the same temperature, especially when, ac
 cording to custom, large boilers are employed. Besides, it
would De very difficult to fix a determinate degree of heat by
 the thermometer when the furnaces are large.
    The yellow parts of the madder as well as of other colour
 ing substances are, it is probable, nothing else than the co
 louring parts themselves combined with oxygen. The pro
 duct of this combination, by acquiring greater solubility,
 suffers itself with more difficulty to be taken away by clearing,
 if the heat has not been properly regulated during the process
 pf dyeing. I have often pbferved that madder and other co-
                                                            lpuring

  172                Observations on  MadJering,
 louring substances, when long exposed to the atmospheric
 air, do not give colours of the fame intensity and the same
 brightness as before; either because these substances absorb
 the oxygen of the atmosphere, or that they procure this radical
 from the water which they attract, or which they naturally
 contain as a constituent principle, and which is decomposed
by a slow and insensible fermentation.       The exposure, on the
 grass, of cotton or linen dyed a dark madder red, might sup
 port the idea of a change to a reddish yellow; for this dark
 colour becomes clearer but fainter by the exposure, and then
 assumes a more agreeable (hade of crimson.         I have shown,
in a memoir on indigo, inserted in the Journal de Pbyjtque
 for the" year 1788, that nitric acid changes this blue fecula
into a yellowish substance: a similar change takes place by
exposing, on the meadow, the fame fecula hxed on any stuff
whatever; and the yellow resulting in these two ways is
more soluble- in warm water than in the same liquid when
cold.     It however appears that the combination of oxygen is
not the only cause of the change of colours, since curtains of
any stuff dyed or coloured any (hade whatever by vegetable or
animal substances, and exposed to the light, lose their colour
entirely in the course of time on the side exposed to the solar
rays, while the opposite fide retains it for a considerable time.
If the rays of the fun then give more vigour to living bodies
of the animal and vegetable kingdom by disengaging from
the latter oxygen gas, it appears that they act with destruc
tive influence on the (ame bodies deprived of life, by decom
posing their constituent principles.      In all cafes it will be
proper     to preserve  the  colouring ingredients in dry places
ihellered from the light, which acts upon these bodies per
haps only by decomposing the constituent aqueous part, the
oxygen of which may join the carbon to form carbonic acid.
Resinous and oily substances should be preserved in the same
way.     These conjectures prove at least that the action of the
fun's rays, or of light, on these bodies, in general presents a
vast field for interesting experiments to be undertaken.
    If in maddering brighter colours are obtained by carefully
regulating the heat, a sacrifice is made at the fame time of a
small portion of the colouring parts of the madder, which
cannot be entirely exhausted except by then increasing the
heat to ebullition ; but as the colours thus obtained are de
graded more or less in the ratio of the quantity of the mad
der, the gall-nut or sliumac used, this method must be
employed with caution, and principally for common effects,
either in regard to cotton or linen.        To avoid as much as
possible the loss of madder after the maddering of good arti
                                                              cles

cles   has been terminated, and before the common ones are
put   into   the boiler, powdered gall-nut or (liumac must be
added, with a new but small portion of madder : the process
must be managed also in such a manner, that the ebullition
shall not take place till two hours after.
    I several times tried to exhaust the madder by simple ebul
lition, and without adding any thing else than chalk ; but
I  found that this was unfavourable to all colours, black ex
cepted : it even appeared that the effect of the madder was
much less than when the heat was moderately applied, and
when the accumulated caloric easily decomposed the colour
ing substance.       It is this tendency to be decomposed, and
particularly by fermentation, however little it be moistened
or diluted with water, which has hitherto prevented me from
obtaining a substantial colour, pretty dark, and sufficiently
fixed to be applied on any kind of stuff. I observed also, that
if the heat was carried too far the first time, in circumstances
when it was proposed to madder a second and third time, it
prevented me not only from obtaining bright and agreeable
shades, but also of the requisite intensity.     The aqueous ve
hicle of the madder, at too high a temperature,        never fails
to weaken the adhesive force ot the alumine and the oxhide of
iron to the stuff", and to take from it a portion, which an ex
 perienced eye may easily remark on examining the bath.
     I shall here repeat, that for common and low-priced articles
it is indispensably necessary to employ gall-nuts or shumac,
 which will save one half and even two thirds of the madder ;
 but the colours obtained are neither so fixed nor so bright.
 The addition of chalk, however, must not be omitted ; other
 wise the gallic acid will carry away a portion of the alumine
 and coloured oxide of iron, which will weaken the shades,
 and, by tarnishing the stuffs, will also attack the white which"
 may have been preserved in them. Without the addition of
gall-nuts or shumac, it seemed to me impossible to exhaust
 the madder entirely of its colouring parts; which made me
 presume that their adhesion is favoured by the viscid nature
 of the tanning principle of these astringent substances, which
 carry awav and combine with themselves the colouring parts.
 I  shall observe also, that gall-nuts as well as shumac lose the
 property of dyeing black; and acquire, on the other hand,
 that of dyeing or colouring alumine yellow, oxide of iron
 olive green, by the addition of chalk, the calcareous base of
 which unites itself to the gallic acid.    Do these yellow and
 olive-green colours arise from any peculiar substance con-,
 tained in the gall-nuts

   their origin to the tanning principle?         This remains  to be
   examinee!.
      The quantity of madder to be employed in dyeing ought
   not only to be proportioned to the extent of the surfaces to be
   maddered, but also to the concentration of the liquors of the
   acetite of alumine and iron, improperly called mordants; that
  is to fay, to the greater or less quantity of alumine and oxide
  of iron which these saline liquors, either insulated or mixed
  together, when they dry on the articles to be dyed, may have
  left or deposited there by the evaporation of the acetic acid.
  If the objects to be dyed are not numerous, and, in parti
  cular, when bright shades only are to be produced, they may
  be maddered only once ; but when they are numerous, and
  intended to have dark shades, the maddering must be repealed
  twice, and even thrice. Three quarters of a pound of madder
  of a good quality are sufficient for dyeing a piece of white In
 dian cloth of ten ells in length and three quarters broad, in
  tended to exhibit only a few coloured objects : the quantity
 of the colouring substance must be increased in the ratio of
 the mass of alumine and oxide of iron, fixed on a piece of
 stuff of the above dimensions.         It may be extended to 6, 8,
 10, and    even  12 pounds,   for  a  ground well covered with a
 lively   and  very intense  colour.     Intelligence and practice in
 the management of a dye-house will not fail to indicate
 nearly the proper proportions.
     Whatever care may be employed in maddering lo avoid
 the adhesion of the yellow parts, the colours obtained will
 be far from having all the Deauty and fixity which they
might acquire by clearing, preceded by very long ebullition
in exceedingly pure water. This ebullition alone, by the
addition of bran, will serve to brighten the colour : more
rosy reds will be obtained by employing soap with or without
the addition of bran ; carbonate of potash or of soda, substi
tuted for bran, will make the reds incline to crimson; but
I must observe, that unless the workman chooses to run the
risk of making the reds entirely brown, and in such a man
ner that it will not be possible to restore them, it will be
necessary, before soap and alkalies are applied to the stuffs,
to expose them to the action of the strongest heat that can
be communicated to water.          This operation will be attended
with success, if as little passage as possible be afforded to the
steam, and if the boilers employed          be converted into a sort
of digesters.     The fixity of the colours will be proportioned
to the time employed in exposing them to the action of the
boiling water. It is needless to observe, that there is no
                                                             danger

danger of spoiling       the colours by soap and alkaline carbo
nates, when the maddering, instead 01 being directed with
a moderate heat, has been carried to ebullition, as is prac
tised in many dye-houses ; but, in this cafe, the colours ob
tained are more difficult to be cleared.
    As water charged with oxygenated muriatic acid easily
carries away the colouring parts of madder, as well as other
vegetable and animal subltances, by decomposing them ; and
as acids more concentrated mav, in their turn, take from the
stuffs the colourless ahmiine and the oxide of iron, it is im
possible for me to adopt the idea of a chemical combination,
 of the colouring parts with alumine and metallic oxides,
 which, in my opinion, when fixed and coloured on any stuff,
 form only compound aggregates.
     The clearing of objects printed on a white ground requires
 modifications, which I (hall detail on a future occasion, when
 I find leisure. It will therefore be sufficient at present to
 state, that after continuing for some time my experiments on
 the Turkey red, inserted in the Annales de Cbimie for the
 year 1792.       I at last found a red much more beautiful and
 durable than that of the Levant, by fixing alumine on cotton,
 thread, and linen, by an alkaline solution of this earth mixed
 with linseed oil. The following is the process I employed.

   little known as the country where, and the person by whom.
  The author, however, has collected from the oldest authors
  what is to be found on the subject, and examined it with cri
  tical accuracy. The earliest account of instruments destined
  to mark the lapse of time by the sun's fliadow is to be found
  in the Bible and in Homer. A fun dial constructed according
  to the description of Vitruvius was found in the year 1741,
  among the ruins of a villa on the Tusculan hill at Rome.          A
  sun- dial of the same kind is still to be seen at Athens, standing
  on the summit of a rock, to the right of an edifice built by
 Thrasyllus.
      II. Use ofsun- dials, and the division cs the day into hours,
 among different anlient nations; gradual improvement of the
 art of conslruSing and using them to the present period.—
 The Indians, Siamese, Tartars,' Persians, Chaldeans, Egyp
 tians, and Chinese divided the day into 60 hours, and each
 hour into 60 minutes, &c.         These people even employed a
 gnomon for the purpose of placing their temples according to
 the principal quarters of the globe.        We know from history
 that the Chinese made use of gnomons 12 or 15 centuries
 perhaps before the birth of Christ.       The old geographers, by
 examining the length of the shadows of gnomons of equal
 height, determined the latitude of places, and the obliquity
 of the ecliptic. Berosus brought to Greece from Asia the di
 vision of the day into twelve hours; and the first sun-dial.
 Anaximander, about six centuries before Christ, made an im
provement in sun-dials, as did also Anaximenes. Eudoxus, four
 centuries before Christ, constructed a still more perfect sun
 dial, under the name of aracbne. Apollonius of Perga, about
 a century before Christ, invented the pbaretra.           Patrocles
found out the pelekinon, Dionyfiodorus the sun-dial in the form
of a cone, Cleanthes the hemisphere or scapha, Parmenio the
proslapislorumena,    Theodosius and Andreas the prospanklima.
 Vitruvius makes mention of three other sun-dials ; gonarcha,
engenaton, and antiboreum, without describing them or nam
ing the inventors. The author describes all these sun-dials
with as much precision as the accounts of them remaining will
allow, and with literary and technical accuracy. There were
public sun-dials both at Athens and Sparta. Eratosthenes and
Archimedes employed dials very accurately divided for astro
nomical purposes; and all the cities of Greece of any consi
deration soon had public instruments of this kind.         Ring-di
als soon began also to be used.        A dial of this kind was sus
pended in the large ship of Hiero; but the Grecian navigators,
for measuring the state of the sun, the time of the day, and
the stars above the horizon, employed rather the hodometer
                                                          described

ples.   It is not known, however, when portable sun-dials
came into use. Some of these instruments, after being buried
more than 1 500 years, were found between 1 730 and 1 740
in the territories of Rome : of these remains of antiquity the
author gives a description. That Purbach, an astronomer of
Vienna, introduced sun-dials into Germany about 300 vears
ago is not probable, as the Germans, no doubt, obtained
them by their intercourse with the Romans.           In the 16th
century artists took great pains to construct sun-dials in a
great many ingenious ways ; about the fame period lunar
and astral dials were invented.   There is a sun-dial at Besan-
9on which is seen only when the fun shines.          This is also
described, as well as the dial below the roof of the council-
house at IngolcHtadt. Another at Alencon, still more ingeni
ous, is connected with wheel-work, and indicates true and
mean time.      In the museum at Gottingen there is a collec
tion of sun-dials, and other works of art of a similar kind, pre
served in a box.
  III.   Oldeji method os dividing the night. Invention os
water-clocks and/and- glajses, and the progressive improvement
of them to the present time. —The circumstance of sun-dials be
ing of no use in the night-time, and during cloudy weather,
gave   occasion to the invention and improvement of water-
clocks ; traces of which may be found among the oldest na
tions, the Cha-ldeans and Egyptians.      They were in use also
at an early period amonj the Chinese.       They were employed
by the Egyptian astronomers for measuring the diameter of
the sun.    In their first state they were called clepsydra, be
cause the water i slued from them drop by drop.       The defect,
in regard lo the inequality in the efflux was at first remedied
bv the small stick of the Indians having a hole bored in       it,

  and which floats some time on the water, but which after 3
  certain period, discovered by repeated trial, becomes immer
  sed.    It was afterwards contrived to keep the wafer- clock al
  ways full, by suffering the same quantity of water to run in
  as that which flowed out, that equal portions of time might
  be indicated by an equal fall. A funnel or inverted pyramid
  was then employed, in which the water descended in unequal
  parts, but through equal degrees marked out on a scale.        In
  the course of time the knowledge of astronomy was applied
 to these clocks, and some were constructed in a very ingeni
  ous manner: of this kind was the anapboricum,          which the
  author describes; also the retrograding clock, and winter water-
  clock.     Plato brought the first water-clock to Greece.    The
  first that ever appeared at Rome was shown by Scipio Nasica,
  about the year 157 before Christ : but soon after these clocks
 were common, not only at Rome, but in other towns of the
 Roman empire. When Julius Cæsar invaded Britain, he
 found that the inhabitants had water-clocks. In general they
 were more prized than sun-dials.          Athenæus constructed a
 clock which indicated the hours by the hisline; noise of the
 air forced through a narrow hole by the pressure of water.
 Together with public sun- dials, public water-clocks were also
 soon introduced. These were establistied even in the palaces of
 the great. That the hours as announced by these water-clocks
 may be more easily made known to the public, the Turk*
 have criers posted on high towers, — and the Chinese, persons
 who strike on large bells. The Japanese employ burning
 matches to indicate the time, and announce the hours in the
 fame manner as the Chinese.           The use which Hipparchus
 and Ptolemy made of water-clocks contributed to their im
 provement : they were much improved by Hero, but during
 the next seven centuries nothing was done in this respect.
 The clocks of Boethius, that which Harun al Raschid sent as
 a present to Charlemagne, and that os the philosopher Leo
 or Constantinople, were much celebrated,           though the in
 vention of clocks with wheel-work rendered water-clocks un
 necessary.     The latter, however, continued some time after
 in use; and about the year 1660 water-clocks in the form of
 a drum, which are those called properly at present water-
 clocks, were invented it is probable in Italy, but rather for
 curiosity than for real use. The observation that the water
 soon ev.-iporated, may have given occasion to fund being used
in such clocks instead of water. The period when this change
 was made is not known. There is reason onlv to conjecture
that the Egyptians and Chaldeans had hour glasses. In the
Monachal Laws the word klepsammidia occurs ouly in writ
ings of the eighth century; and it was not till a much later

 an elegant and ingenious manner.             Many of them are de
scribed by Francis ae Lanis, as well as by Schott and Oza-
nam.      Rivault employed such sand-glasses for astronomical
observations;      and likewise Tycho Brahe, who used also
clocks constructed with quicksilver.

to Charlemagne.         At that period the ealfern princes present
ed clocks to the western ; at present this mode is reversed.

a selection.     This publication, however, is not merely an
extract from the above large work ; if is a new treatise,
which cannot fail of interesting those who are in the pos
session of the other.      It is founded on the fame principles,

     In the meetings of the 25th of February, 4th and j ith of
 March, a paper which has been expected for some time oc
 cupied the attention of the Society ; namely, Mr. Howard's,
 on the analysis of stones that have fallen frdm the clouds.
     Mr. Howard begins with a historical detail of the various
 relations of this kind which are found on record, and par
 ticularly refers to the essays of Mr. King and professor
 Chladni, and to various authors quoted by them.         But the
 first instances with which chemistry has interfered are those
 of a stone presented to the French Academy by the abbe
Bachelay in 1768; and another examined afterwards by pro
 fessor Barthold.    The stones from Sienna in 1794 ; the large
stone of 56 Ibs. weight which fell in Yorkstiire in 1795, and
 was exhibited soon after in London; and the substances which
fell at Benares in 1798, arc the immediate subjects of Mr.
Howard's investigation.      All these agree in the general ap
pearance of an alli-gray stony substance, mixed with spangles
of pvrites and of native iron, and externally of a dark colour,
covered with a semi-vitrified and blistered crust.    The abbe
Bachelay's was supposed to contain 8 j sulphur, 36 iron, and
55^ earth; and some of tlte others were found to consist of
similar ingredients. The (tone which fell near Mr. Topham's
house in Yorkshire, penetrated twelve inches deep into the
earth, and six more into a chalk rock : its fall was accom
panied with noises like a discharge of artillery,   A very par
ticular and perfectly authenticated account is given, in the
uords of Mr. Williams, of several substances which fell about
                             M   3                        twelve

twelve miles from Benares, and penetrated some inches into
the earth in several spots within the distance of 100 yards;
their fall being accompanied by a very vivid light.
      Mr. Howard proceeds to mention another specimen from
 the Musæum Bornianum, now in the possession of Mr. Gre-
 ville, said to have fallen in Bohemia, which agrees with the
 rest in its characters.      A mineralogical description of these
 stones by the Count de Bournon is subjoined.            They appear
 to consist principally of substances of four kinds, besides the
 dark crust which surrounds them : the first of these substances
 is in the form of dark grains, of a conchoidal fracture, from
 the size of a pin's headto that ot a pea ; the second is a kind
 of pyrites, the third is metallic iron, and the fourth a gray
  earthy substance, serving as a cement to the rest. The pro
  portions of these substances appear to differ in some measure
  in the different specimens, the iron abounding most in the
  specimens from Yorkshire and from Bohemia. Mr. Howard
  has ascertained, by a chemical analysis, that silica, iron, mag
  nesia, sulphur, and nickel, are contained in the different parts
  of these iubstances.     The globular bodies and the cementing
  earth each contained about 50 silex, 15 magnesia, 34 iron,
  and 1 j; nickel.
      From 150 grains of the earthy part of the stone from Si
   enna, Mr. Howard obtained about 70 silica, 34 magnesia,
   53 oxide of iron, and 3 oxide of nickel ; the contents of the
   specimens from Yorkshire and from Bohemia were not ma
   terially different. Mr. Howard proceeds to inquire into the
   causes of the difference in the results of his analysis and those
   of the foreign chemists, with respect to the species of the
   earths.    After having shown the striking analogy between
   these substances, and their total dissimilarity to other mineral
   products, Mr. Howard examines into the form and contents
   of various specimens of native iron : observing that Mr. Proust
   detected nickel in a large mass nf native iron found in South
   America; Mr. Howard diseov ;rs a portion of the fame metal
   in every specimen that he has examined from different parts
    of the world. A description of these specimens by the Count
    de Bournon is inserted, and the large mass discovered by pro
    fessor Pallas in Siberia, is particularly described.    It is found
    to contain detached masses of semi-transparent substances con
    siderably resembling some of the constituent parts of the stones
    from Benares. Mr. Howard does not give a decided opinion
    respecting the origin of all these substances ; he only observes
    that they agree in several remarkable properties, distinguish
    ing them from all other bodies, that they all appear," from
    well authenticated accounts, to have fallen on the earth, at
                                                                 tended

                 VACCINE INOCULATION.
       our last we mentioned that Dr. Sacco, of Milan, had
sent to Dr. Pearson cow-pock matter taken from the Mi
lanese cows.     In a work published by Dr. Sacco, in Italian,
entitled, Practical Observations on the Use of the Cow-pock,
as a Preservative against the Small-pox, lie gives the follow
ing account of the manner in which he procured the pus for
inoculation, and also a representation of a cow's udder in-
feeted with the malady. (See Plate VI.)
  "   For some time I had been extremely desirous to repeat
the experiments of Jenncr, and for this purpose made diligent
search to discover the cow-pox in Lonibardy, it being ex
tremely difficult, especially in the present circumstances, to
obtain the pus from England.        A fortunate combination of
circumstances, bv which it became necessary for me to go to
the large town of Varcse, in the beginning of autumn, pro
cured me an opportunity of examining a number of cows on,
their way from Switzerland to the fair of Lugano; and by
this means I had a favourable opportunity to make such re
searches as might discover in some one of them the cow-pox.
It was on this occasion, that, conversing with some dealers in
 cattle, and countrymen who had large dairies in Lower
Lonibardy, I learnt that the cows among us are subject to
the cow-pox.          In this inquiry I took care to propose my
questions in such a manner as to prevent the risk of being
 imposed upon. A farmer of Cremona, who had bought forty
 cows in Switzerland, and had driven them from thence as
 far as Varese, assured me that almost all of them had been
 successively attacked with pustules on the extremity of their
 nipples, and some of these were now converted into incrusta
 tions.    I visited the cows, and had an opportunity of verify
 ing   his assertions.   I picked off some of these incrustations
 with an intention of applying them in fomentation,        if,per
  chance,
        I     could not procure the true pus for inoculation.
  The fame farmer promised me an opportunity of seeing this
  disease with my own eyes, and for this purpose conducted
  nve to
       a    neighbouring meadow,    in    which we found   a  herd
  of cows belonging to  a      friend of his. We examined these
  cows, and discovered on two of them different red spots,
  which the farmer assured me was the first stage of the disease:
  no other symptom appeared on the cows, but      a  slight degree
  of dejection,     lit allured me that this was the very disease
                                                           I     was

tules   ; three of these were spread over the nipples, and the
fourth lay in the middle of the dugs.        The other cow had
fix pustules ; two on the nipples, and" the rest scattered abov«
them.      These were larger than those of the first cow, and
around them appeared a slight red circle.       Apparently these
pustules occasioned much pain to the cows; for, on my ap
proaching to examine them more minutely, they would
scarcely permit me to touch them for one moment.              Al
though the pustules were already large and prominent, they
did not yet appear to me sufficiently mature to yield the matter
I   wanted.    As the cows were that day to go forward on their
w.iy to Milan, I found myself under the necessity of follow
ing them to their first halting-place, in order to examine
them again next day.         I walked out at an early hour to
the meadow where they were at pasture.           I examined the
   ustules, which appeared to me to be now arrived at maturi-
Ey. They were lucid, and of a pale red colour, with a brown
spot in the middle more depressed ; and I thought this a fa
vourable moment to collect the matter, which, through the
 assistance of the herdsmen, I was easily enabled to do Dy re
peatedly soaking a thread in it.     Although I saw no reason
 to doubt that this was the true cow-pox, yet, this being the
 first time I had ever seen it,
                              I    began to suspect that the pus
 tules might be of that kind which .Tenner calls the spurious
 cow-pox     I
             :  determined, therefore, to decide the matter by
 experiment.      A considerable number of experiments, all
 uniform in their symptoms and progress, and alwavs con
 stant in their results, put the matter beyond doubt, and gave
 me full conviction that this was the true cow-pox.          Such
        so
 and       many are the obstacles to be overcome on the intro
 duction of any innovation, however salutary, that  I    for some
 time despaired of being able to induce any one to submit to
 inoculation with the matter had collected. In fine, after
                              I
 many fruitless persuasions,I     succeeded in   my design the
                                                          :

   success which attended the first inoculations encouraged others
   to submit to the same process."
       Dr. Sacco then proceeds to detail three hundred cafes, in
   which he applied the pus he had obtained in the manner
   described above.        These cases were attended with' various
   circumstances; but the inoculation succeeded to produce the
  cow-pox in all of them s and in a considerable number the
   inoculation for the small-pox was afterwards applied, but
  without anv effect.
                       ELECTRICITY       AND LIGHT.
       The following hint for electric experiments is communi
  cated by a person who has not a room fitted up properly for
  making such nice experiments himself :
       The  electric matter being supposed by some philosophers
  lo    be the fame as the ether mentioned by Newton, which
  he imagined constantly to reside near the surface of all bodies,
   I  wish  to have the following       experiments made by some of
  your readers,      and the results    communicated to the public
  by your Magazine.
       Let small wire bars be electrified positively and negatively,
  as it is called, and placed in a convenient situation, so that
  rays of light may pass very near them, and observe whether
  any difference is produced cither in the reflection or inflection
  of the ravs when the bars are electrified ; and what that dif
  ference, if any, is. These experiments may perhaps give
  some insight into the two states of electricity, and inform us
  whether the positive is a condensed state, and the negative a
  rarefied state, of the electric matter.

       The astrologers alarmed Europe in 1 186 by announcing
  a conjunction of all the planets, which was to occasion ex
  traordinary ravage. Iiiavc spoken of this in the preface to my
  Astronomy: but, being desirous to know whether this rare and
  singular phænomenon really took place that year, C. Flau-
  guergues, associate of the Institute, a zealous astronomer, un
  dertook to make the necessary calculations, and sound, indeed,
  that on the 15th of September 1 186 all the planets were
  comprehended between 6 signs, and 6 signs 10 degrees of
  longitude.       This is not exactly a conjunction, but many
  thousands of years perhaps must elapse before there          will  be
  such an approximation towards a conjunction.                        \

 and Sir William Hamilton, procured him a connection with
 the first artilts of Europe; by which means access was opened
for him to objects in different countries, and he was thus
enabled to carrv his long-projected plan into execution, not
withstanding the multiplied representations which were made
to him respecting the difficulties to be encountered in such
an undertaking.         Tischbein began his work, on which he
incessantly    laboured    for several years, with uncommon zeal,
patience,   and   assiduity,   and at a very considerable    expense.
In this manner he formed a valuable series of drawings,
relating to, and illustrative of, the poems of Homer ; and
they no doubt would have been long; ago published, had he
not been interrupted in his peaceful occupation by the tu
mult of arms, and obliged, in consequence of the taking of
Naples by the French, to abandon Italy.              Fy making great
sacrifices, both in regard to labour and money, he carried off
in safety his valuable treasure, among which was one of the
first master-pieces of Raphael, a painting of St. John ; to
gether with his drawings for Homer, ana such of the plates
as were already engraved.           In the course of his passage by
sea, from Naples to Leghorn, a passage which carried him
past several or those islands celebrated in fabulous history, he
experienced a violent storm in the very place where the draw
ings of Leonardo da Vinci, and those of Michael Angelo
which he had executed for Dante, were formerly lost j and
the ship,bcing unable to weather the storm, was driven on the

    MEASURING       A DEGREE OF THE          MERIDIAN IN

   The following extract of a letter on this subject from M.
Melanderhielm, perpetual secretary of the Academy of
Sciences of Stockholm, to C. Delambre, member of trie
French National Institute, dated October 9th and December

received the circle, the double metre with the toise, and the

tained no damage by the way.
    "Since these articles arrived, Messrs. Svanberg, Ofverbom
 and myself have been employed in examining all the parts
of the circle, and comparing it with the complete description
 which you had the kindness to communicate to me. We
 have thus obtained a perfect knowledge of the mecha

 method of making observations.      As the prospect from the

    " The double metre, the toise, and the volumes, which the

   "   In regard to the measurement in Lapland,         shall give

and the angles, they will have occasion for two able and ex
pert ones.
   " In this respect have found every thing could desire.

The first     M. Holmquist, mathematical assistant at Upsal,
             is
where he has laboured for several years in the observatory                  ;
the other       M. Paluder, teacher of mathematics in the
                  is
university of Abo, in Finland. They are both well acquainted
with the mathematics and astronomy, and animated with the
strongest zeal for the success of the expedition.
   " Messrs. Svanberg and Ofverbom returned hither in the
beginning of October,lheir first journey having been attended
with complete success. The only thing wanting, in my opi
nion,  is, that, notwithstanding the strictest search, they were
not able to find the northern point of the base of 1736. The
uncertainty in regard to this point         about two toises.
                                              is                           I
consider this difference as   great defect,as
                               a                wissied, above all
                                                    I
things, to have exactly the Tame base, to render our verifica
tion more certain and conclusive. They have found all the
other stations and points of the measurement of the above
period.    What they have done besides may be reduced to
the following articles they have erected all the signals ne
                           :
cessary for continuing the arc, which will extend to lat. 670
08' 36", almost 30' oeyond that of 1736. They have also
given  a peculiar construction to the signals, that they may be
exactly sure of the point observed.       have sent you the figure
                                           1
and description of these signals.    They have caused two new
observatories to be built at the extremities of the arc, with
huts to serve as lodging-places during the time of observa
tion.   But all their researches to find ground proper for                  a
second base have been fruitless.    We must be contented with
measuring twice the same base as         in
                                        1730.
                                                                          <<In

            unexpected incident retards their journey, Messrs.
 Svanberg and Ofverboni expect to set out for Lapland to
 wards the middle of January next.      By these means they may
 employ the months of February, March, April, and even part
of May, in measuring the base on the river Tornea, since the
 ice seldom thaws in that country before the end of May.'"'
    From the conclusion of this letter it is to be presumed
that the Swedish astronomers are now on their way to Lap
land.    To form a just idea of the zeal and courage which
their enterprise requires, nothing is necessary but to read the
work published in 1738 by Maupcrtuis under the title of
Figure de la Terrc determine e far les Ohjervations suites au
 Circle Polaire; and particularly page 51, where an account
is given of the measurement of the base, begun on the 21st of
December 1736, and finished the 27th of the same month.
It is here seen that Messrs. Svanberg and Ofverboni propose
to devote a much more considerable time to this operation,
in order that no doubt may remain respecting the correctness
of it. The angles which they mean to observe at the two
extremities of their base, between signals placed in the very
fame points as those of 1736, will perhaps enable them to
find more exactly the northern term of the old base.      At all
events, what ought to lessen the regret of M. Melanderhielm,
as well as ours,is,that the triangle on this base was situated in
the manner molt favourable for making the distance between
Avaska and the southern term independent of the small
errors unavoidable in the measurement os angles.        The cafe
is  nearly the fame with the second triangle;       so  that the
distance between Avaska and Cuituper may, like that of
Avaska from the southern term, give results as certain and
as conclusive as the direct companion of the bases of 1736
and 1801.

  XXXVI.      On the Fujion of Malleable Iron with various Kindt
     of Glass ; being a Continuation of the Examination of
     C. Clouet's Process for making Cajl Steel. By David
     Mush et, Esq. of the Calder Iron IVorks*.
  V-».   CLOUET,      in his results of experiments upon iron and
 steel, states, that a particular modification      of iron is formed
 by fusing malleable iron with glass ; and           infers, that this
 change is effected by the combination of a small portion of
  the glass with the metal.
     In my last communication I had occasion to remark, that
 the mixtures there fused in contact with malleable iron en
 tered into fusion a considerable     time before the iron.     It ap
 peared, therefore, sufficiently obvious that a perfect glass was
 formed before any disposition to fusion was indicated on the
 part of the iron. Reasoning in this manner, I could distin
 guish no difference of situation betwixt iron exposed in contact
 with a glass formed by an union of clay and lime, and be
 twixt the fame substance exposed to fusion in contact with
 window or bottle glass.
     If an alteration of quality is effected, and this as being the
 consequence of an affinity exerted upon the glass by means
 of the iron, then it appeared probable that the affinity would
 exert itself in both cases, and be productive of similar effects.
 In short, since the carbonate of lime had failed in forming
 steel, it was conceived that the results of the fame iron fused
 in contact with glass, would be analogous to -those obtained
with a mixture of iron, lime, and clay.
    The following experiments are selected from a great variety
performed to ascertain this point.

From this mixture was obtained a very perfect fusion,
accompanied with a dense, smooth-skinned button of

drew easily into shape, and formed a solid handsome bar.
This was subjected to various tests, in all of which it exactly
resembled the products obtained with the clay and carbonate
formerly described.
    The glass in this experiment, when compared with a mass
of the fame fused per se, was of a darker green colour, possessed
of an additional (hade of amber.

The result in to minutes was a finely formed button,
weighing               -                                        1090

This experiment was performed to ascertain if the quality
of iron was affected by a reduction of the vitrid matter.
Nothing materially different as to quality could be inferred.
The fracture of the button approached to. a regular crystal
lization, in which some very perfect cubes of T'0th inch upon
the fide were formed.                                          Grains.

                                          1750 grains.
There resulted from this mixture a very perfect fusion,
accompanied by a very beautifully crystallized button
of metal, weighing              -                                 860
                                               Lost in f.ision      1 j
 equal to -^-^th part     of  the original weight of the iron.   The
 fracture of this product presented groups of large flat granu
 lated crystals resembling in point of colour No. 3.         One-half
 of the button forged with every appearance of softness and
 malleability, and formed a solid bar.       In subsequent tests, no
 (hade of distinction could be found betwixt this and the qua
 lity of the three former results.
     It would therefore appear conclusive, that Swedisli iron, by
 fusion with bottle glass, forms a species of cas malleable iron
  exactly similar in its appearance and properties to that for
 merly obtained when carbonate of lime and argil were used.
 It is further inferable that the resulting products are not ma
  terially affected by various proportions of glass, feeing that.
 an equal portion, a half, and even a double portion, by
 weight, to the iron, were productive of no perceptible altera-

half of this button drew pleasantly into shape, and formed a

none of that want of tenacity described by Clouet, but in every
respect resembled the qualities of metal described in my two
last communications.         The glass obtained in this experiment
was of a greenish blue lead colour, a little transparent when
broken into thin fragments. Beneath the button of iron                 I
found a small mass ofrevived lead which weighed 135 grains^

The mixture was exposed for an hour to a violent

wards stood hammering, with caution, at a welding heat, but
was so completely red-short that it would not turn at any
shade above a faint red. The fracture of this bar, when cold,
 was partly granulated and partly silky fibrous, of a very light
colour.    The glass approached more to a perfect green than
that of No. V j still, however, faintly' tinged with a shade of

From this mixture resulted a very complete fusion.
The metallic button was minutely but regularly crys
 tallized upon its upper surface.        I  found it to weigh         868

 equal to    —-th     part the original weight of the iron employed.
 The fracture of this metal was silvery white, parting in la
 minae, destitute both of fibre and grain.              This appearance
 •was quite new, and more like zinc than any fracture of iron
 I   had ever before seen. Suffice it to say, that when subjected
     '
 to trial its quality was precisely the same as found in the
 former results.      The glass was light green, resembling that
 of No.     III.                                                    Grains.

 This mixture was reduced to a perfect fusion, and a
  crystallized button of metal obtained marked with
  various prismatic shades.       It was found to weigh               553

  equal to F'Bth part the weightof the iron. The fracture of this
  button was granulated, and in point of appearance and lustre
  differed considerably from No.       VII.     It drew, however, easily
  into shape, and felt soft aud very ductile under the hammer.
  I  ventured to double-weld the cud of the bar ; which it stood
  pretty well, a few edge cracks excepted.              The glass was of
  a blueish green cast, abounding with waving lines of a faint
  garnet colour.       Thin fragments, however, displayed a grassy
  green, considerably transparent.
       It seems decisive, from these experiments, that the quality
  of the metal obtained by the fusion of bottle glass, flint
  glass, and crown glass, with the fame quality of iron, was
  productive of exactly similar results to those described in for
  mer papers, where Swedish iron was used with various pro
   portions of argil and carbonate of lime.           None of these pro
  ducts exhibited any properties of steel, but all of them con
   siderably altered.     The cause of alteration flill remains to be
   developed.     If  glass has an affinilv to iron, this must have
   been exerted in all these fusions alike, whether the glass was
                                                              introduced

 introduced already formed into the crucible, or afterward*
 produced   by the fusion of one or more earths.       In all, similar
 deficiencies of weight have been experienced.          This accords
 not with a combination of glass, which ought to have added
 weight to the results.
    Having thus minutely stated the results of various experi
 ments here detailed, and classed their qualities with that of
 others obtained by different mixtures, and communicated in
two former papers, I sliall next exhibit some experiments
with British cold-short iron, wherein some results approach
very nearly to that description of cast malleable iron described
 by Clouet as combined with glass, and incapable of distend
ing under the hammer.                                           Grains.

A very perfect fusion also resulted from this mixture.

This   mass was also found to be utterly incapable           of

This button was as incapable of hammering and distension
as the former. The accuracy of these results may be inferred
from the respective deficiencies of the weight.         The quality
of the whole seems to be nearly that described by Clouet.

The fracture of this button was completely destitute of grain,
laminated, smooth, and of a silvery white colour.              With
much caution one-half of it was drawn into a small bar ; but
in endeavouring to form it into a point, it became loose, and
incapable, of further distension.       It felt considerably harder
under the hammer than the products from Swedish iron.
This result, upon the whole, was more ductile than any of
the former, and the quantity of class used less.              Grains^

This button possessed a brilliant, flat, granulated fracture.
One-half of it was drawn into a very solid bar possessing duc
tility and softness in an eminent degree.        The quality of this
iron was so completely cold-short before fusion, that a stout
bar of it was easily broken by a blow from a hand hammer.
It now possessed the opposite extreme of red-short, and was so
pliant when cold, that a bar nearly -Jths square folded close
by the compression of the vice, and afterwards opened fairly,
and was bent backwards and forwards seven times before it
cracked.                                                      Grains.

The fracture of this iron displayed a double row of very perfect
cubes inserted in each other.      The colour was a silky light
blue, not so dazzling as in the former experiment. One-half
of this button   was smooth filed upon the fracture, and forged
at a low heat, to endeavour, if postiblc, to obtain a solid bar.
It however cracked considerably, and became loose and slialy.
The hardened fracture possessed a flat, crowded, indistinct
grain, of a dazzling silver)' colour; the surface turned up a
gray spotted shale, resembling thai of cast steel.
                                                                   It

    It would appear from these experiments with bottle glass
and British cold-short iron, that a quality of cast malleable
iron is obtained, different, in general, from the products ob
tained with Swedish iron ; that the least ductile iron is formed
when equal portions of glass and iron are used ; and, that the
most ductile state results from fusing the iron per fe.
   It cannot, however, be inferred from this, that the general
want of ductility is owing to a combination of glass with the
iron, seeing that when Swedish iron was employed under
similar circumstances no want of ductility was perceptible;
I would rather infer, that the difference betwixt the fused re-r
suits was characteristic both of the species of the iron and the
nature of the manufacture.
   The following experiments were performed with flint and
window glass, to prove whether any part of the difference, in
point of quality, arose from the nature of the glass used.

The fracture of the button was composed of large facets,
bright, and inclining to a cubical structure. One-half of the
button drew into a loose shaly bar, considerably cracked upon
the edges.    Jn point of quality it resembled products         XII

  The quality of       the metal now obtained was equally incapable
  of being forged       as that in Exp. IX and X.
       From the nature of the results of these experiments it can
  not be satisfactorily concluded that even the fusion of British
  cold-short iron with glasses is uniformly productive of the
  fame quality of metal.           But it may be fairly deduced that it
  invariablv is product ive of a cast malleable iron, harder aud
  much less ductile in every particular than the results from
  Swedish iron similarly treated.
       The most probable cause of this irregularity of quality in
  the cold-stiort iron I conceive to be crystallizatiop.                 In the
  bar, this quality ot" iron ahvavs presents cubes more or less
  diliinct.       When fused, and allowed to cool under the cir
  cumstances necessary to produce this effect, a large perfectly
  crystallized fracture is the consequence.               This does not in
  variably happen        ; but in  two   experiments out of three, I have
   found it to be t-he cafe.        In a button of 10 to 1200 grains,
  these cubes are found measuring a full quarter of an inch
  upon the Facet ; and Inch sometimes has been the degree of
  division of the fluid, and a consequent perfect crystalliza-

  when a mass such as is now described is put under the

  precise degree of heat could be ascertained which would co

. municates a great degree of red-shortness      to all qualities ; but
                                                                   with

 aoa            On   the Fusion   of Malleable Iron, &c.
with cold-short iron, the extent of the change              is by far the
most considerable.         Its loss by weight is also much beyond
that sustained by Swedish iron.
     I meant to have inserted a few experiments with iron un
commonly red-short; but the number already adduced will,
I  am afraid, have the appearance of prolixity.              Suffice it to
fay, that I have obtained data sufficient to be able to prose
cute, with some hope of success, an investigation of the causes
of red- and cold-short properties in malleable iron.                I shall
conclude this subject with the following remarks : — Iron fused
with window glass always has its upper surface impressed with
a beautiful crystallization, often coloured. This circumstance
never takes place when flint glass is used.                When bottle
glass is used, the crystallization is not so frequent, and sel
dom so perfect, as with window glass.            Crystallization is still
less frequent, and less perfect, when a mixture of clay and
lime is employed. When carbonate alone is fused with iron,
the fame want of crystallization takes place as when flint
glass is used.
    The fusion of malleable iron is productive of the disen
gagement of an elastic fluid, the escape of which, I am in
clined to think, is one of the chief causes of the alteration of
its quality.      In most cafes, when the cover was struck off
while the matter was still red-hot, a burst of whitish blue
flame issued from the mouth of the crucible.                   In others,
where the fusion had been of short duration, or less perfect,
the upper surface of the glass became covered with thin trans
parent bubbles, each of which appeared filled with a dull
lambent blue vapour.           These were easily perforated with a
pin point, and a slight explosion was heard from each, ac
companied by a momentary combustion.                   In burning, this
substance resembled hydrocarbonate *.
    Experiment, which was omitted in the former commu
nication, to prove that the carbonic acid was neutral in the
fusion of iron, or at least was not productive of steel.

                 may lead to a more simple explanation of the formation of

iron with a mixture of glass, without the addition of carbon or its acid in
lime, arc here productive of an elastic substance possessed of similar pro
perties as that obtained in their experiments.

the vitrid mass was minutely examined, but no metallic
globule was visible. The mixture before fusion was mag
netic, owing to the oxide.        This property was now en
tirely lost.
    The heat of this experiment was urged moderately, that
time might be given for the exertion of any affinity, if such
existed, betwixt the iron and the carbonic acid, or betwixt
the oxide of iron and the carbonaceous part of the acid. No
portion of meta) being revived, I conceived this a most con
clusive proof of the nondecomposition of the carbonic acid.

M. BODE,           of Berlin, has publislied the last part of his
laro-e Celestial Atlas in twenty sheets, which contains all the
old constellations, with several new ones, and some thousands
of stars, with which I furnished him ; an immense labour, of
which the astronomers had need. This beautiful work may
be procured at the College de France.
    On the 27th of September the Helvetic republic adopted
the French measures.       This is the first of the European states
which has been sensible of the importance of this universal
measure to the general good of civilized nations.
    Guglielmini, of Bologna, has made three new experiments
on the fall of bodies, to prove the rotation of the earth : he
has found the fame deviation from the south within a line,
though it is not given by theory ; but the deviation from the
west ne has found as it ought to be. Preparations are making
for observations of the fame kind at Hamburgh from the
tower of St. Michael, at the height of 326 feet.
    The observatory of Cadiz, during several years, has fur
nished us with a series of important observations ; but for
some time it has been neglected.           General Mazzaredo has
caused a new one to be built in the Isle-de-Leon, and he has
attached to it four astronomers, officers in the navy — Rodrigo
Armesto, Maximo-Lariva Aguero, Julian Canela, and Jo
seph Cuesta, who have resided there four years.             For ten
vears past, a nautical almanac has been published in Spain.
1 hope navigation and astronomy will be benefited by it. The
telescope 25 feet in length, made           by Dr. Herschel for
Spain, will be sent off in the month of January ; and Du-
pont will go to Spain so mount it.

  2C>4        History of Astronomy for     the Year  1S0I.
      M. Travassos, secretary of the Academy of Lisbon, has
  sent me observations     by M. Ciera, which have confirmed
  the longitude of that city ; the Nautical Ephemerides pub
  lished to 1803, and various works of the Portuguese Academy,
 of which we had no idea, and which the National Institute
 of France received with much interest.             This negotiation
 was conducted by the chevalier d'Aranjo.
      Astronomy was long in a languishing condition in the
 Batavian republic: M. Fokker has established, at his own
 expenses,   an observatory at Middleburg ; he has purchased
 instruments,     and sent us several observations made between
 1797    and 1801.    M. Fokker, during the revolution of 1795,
 was member of the committee of public safety, and at that
 time obtained a tower in the abbey; but The revolution of
 the 12th of June 1796 interrupted his plans for the improve
 ment of the observatory. He is now engaged in tHe finance
 department of Zealand ;. but his spare time is employed on
 astronomy, and he has sent rne several interesting observa
tions.
     In Germany astronomy continues to be cultivated with
 great assiduity.    Baron Von Zach's tour to Bremen and Li-
Henthal has produced new activity; and the society formed
for the purpose of searching the heavens are still occupied
with that object. He observes the moon with great diligence ;
and gives me reason to hope, that I shall fee next summer a
part of the German astronomers assemble in an astronomical
congress at Gotha, as was the cafe in 1798.              Amidst the
horrors of war, the French astronomers signalized their zeal
for astronomy.       General Moreau, being at Cremsmunster,
where there is a celebrated observatory, caused a bill to be
posted up denouncing the punishment of death against every
person who should be guilty there of any depredation ; and
neither the observatory nor the convent of the Benedictines
sustained any injury.      It is flattering to the French to have
officers who distinguish themselves by a taste for the sciences.
It will no longer be said that military men, in consequence
of their situation, are ignorant and ferocious.
     The Academy of Petersburgh has requested an observer,
but Burg and Wurm have been retained by their sovereigns;
and this beautiful observatory is still useless, notwithstanding
the number of excellent instruments with which it is fur
nished.
     C. Henry has had the satisfaction of erecting the large
mural quadrant by Bird, and of making some observations
with it.
     The irregularity in the degrees of the earth hitherto mea

quarto.
   M. Garrard has published tables in thirteen pages only ;
but his method is neither shorter nor so accurate.
.  Mr. Vince, an able English astronomer, has published the
second volume of a large treatise on astronomy.
   The stereotype tables of logarithms, published by Firmin
Didot in 1795, have been again corrected.         M. Vega, who
has caused to be printed in Germany the largest collection
extant, has verified the French tables, and sent us several
faults, which are going to be corrected : in all probability
they will be the last, ana we may depend in future on correct
tables.   This is a great benefit for calculators, who have
sometimes lost whole davs in revising calculations, which
did not agree, in consequence of an erroneous figure.
   But as the small manual tables are most frequently em
ployed, I have caused them to be printed in stereotype : se
veral persons have corrected them ; and in three months 1
can give all calculators the most correct, most convenient,
and most elegant edition that has ever appeared.
   C. Verniquet has finiflied the engraving of his large plan
of Paris in 73 sheets on a scale of half a line to the toise,
which in correctness    surpasses every thing of the kind.
   A project was  long ago formed and undertaken for making
a lunar globe representing all the mountains and craters.
Mr. Russi-1 has accomplished this object in England : his
lunar globe, mounted on an ingenious stand, expresses all
 the circumstances of the moon's libration, and shows that
 body as slie ought to appear in the different positions of the
                                                           earth.

earth and moon,       as  well as the variations of the equator and
 orbit.
    M.   Philippides, born at Mount Pelion in Theflaly, who
attended     the course of astronomy at the College de France
in 1794, and who is now at Jafli with the hospodar of Mol
davia, proposes to publish in Greek the Abridgement of my
Astronomy : he has already published various works, for the
purpose of endeavouring to propagate              instruction in his
 country.
    Three-fourths of the two last volumes of Montucla's His
tory of the Mathematics are printed.           This work will con
tain the history of astronomy, optics, and navigation; to
which I have been obliged to make great additions in conse
 quence ofthe too premature death of the learned author.
    M. Von Murr, of Nuremberg, who has manuscripts of
 Regiomontanus, the first restorer of astronomy before 1500,
has caused a page to be engraven, an exact sac- simile of the
character of the manuscript : he offers to fell these manu
scripts for 2400 francs ; they would be a treasure to a large
library.
    The astronomical     poems of Ricard, Lemiere, and Fontanes,
had before     shown how far a view of the heavens is capable
of exciting poetical enthusiasm.       C. Gudin has again proved
it by a poem, which contains both the history ot astronomy
and a description of the heavens, and which displays as much
correctness    as elegance.
   This year geography also has made considerable progress.
Tranchol is constructing a map of the four united depart
ments on the scale of a line to 100 toises : a survey is taking
of the country between the Adige and the Adda, Piedmont,
jSwabia, and Swisserland; and the minister at war caused the
details to be inserted in the Moniteur of August 14.
    C. Henry, who has been invited to Munich to construct the
map of Bavaria, informs me in a letter that the topographical
part is in great forwardness ; a base of 21,649 metres or 11,108
toises has been measured : it is the longest ever measured.
The large triangles around the capital aro already in part
closed.    There arc some the sides of which will be from
15   to 20   leagues, and even more.         lie has already swept
the horizon several times with his circle, and with astonisliing
precision. The last sweep was composed of six angles; the
sum of which when reduced was not in excess, but 8-ioths
of a second in 360 degrees; and yet the circle he used was
not very good. To make up as much as possible for what
may be wanting in regard to precision, he multiplies his ob
servations : he never makes less than 15 conjugate observa

lions,    and he often carries the number to 20.     The triangles
which Caflini      assumed in the neighbourhood of Munich are
badly chosen, and the measurement of them is very incor
rect. Without employing his triangles, Henry has alreadv
disposed a series or 14 triangles, the measure of which will
give us that of an arc of the meridian of somewhat more than
a degree : he hopes that it will still be possible to prolong this
arc, which will pass at a little distance from Ingoldstadt, and
which will ascertain the positions of a part of Germany. The
 travels of baron Von Zach and several of his co-operators
have also supplied us with new information and new posi
 tions, which will improve the geography of Germany.           Co
 lonel le Cocq continues his map of Westphalia.
     Baron Von Ende, member of the supreme council os ap
 peal at Cette, has published a volume on the determination
 of several places in Lower Saxony : it is filled with observa
 tions and calculations.
      The geography of distant countries has assumed also a new
 activity. Captain Baudin, whole voyage of discovery 1 before
 announced, left the Canaries on the 24th of November, and
 the Isle of France on the 22d of March.        We have reason to
 hope    that he  has already  made interesting discoveries in New
  Holland ; the only country of the earth which is almost un
  known to us, though it is 2000 leagues in circumference.
  Bemier, the astronomer who accompanies him on the expe
  dition, a man of intelligence and courage, leaves nothing to
  be wiflied for on that head.        In the month of June the
  French government granted passports to the English vessels,
  the Jnveliigator, captain Flinders, on the point of proceed
  ing on a voyage of discovery to the South Seas, and to the
  Lady Neison, commanded by lieutenant Grant, who is to
  accompany the Investigator, in exploring the coasts of New
  Wales.
       C. Deguignes jun., arrived from China, where he resided
  from 1784 to 1797, will, in all probability, when he pub
  lishes the journal of his voyage, give us some information
   respecting that beautiful part of the world.
       Baron Humboldt, an enlightened and intrepid philosopher,
   has gone to South America, where he has travelled 1300
   leagues in the deserts, with great labour and amidst terrible
   dangers, to make us acquainted with the geography and na
   tural history of those countries which ate still new to us.
       M. Deferrer has sent me observations which give the posi

 3C8         History of'Astronomy    for  the Year 1801.
    C. Nouet has sent us from Egypt an almanac calculated
 for that country, and several positions of cities even in Upper
Egypt, notwithstanding the climate, the dangers, and incon
 ceivable labour which such observations require.         The value
of the degree is 56,880 toises ; the Egyptian stadium 711
feet; the Egyptian cubit 21 33 inches; the Greek stadium
487-543 feet, and the cubit 19*5017 inches.           In a word, he
 has arrived  himself,   and brought   us  the continuation of his
 labours, accompanied with young Isaac Mechain, the son of
one of our most celebrated astronomers, who was his com
panion and co-operator in Egypt.          C. Fourrier has brought
us drawings of the zodiacs of Upper Egypt, which attest the
 high antiquity of astronomy ; and he proves that the forma
 tion of the constellations goes back 14,000 years, as Dupuis
presumed.
    C. Marquis, præfect of La Meurthe,        has sent to the Board
of Longitude observations and manuscripts of P. Barlet, a Jesuit
of Nancy, which contain interesting things.
    I must here fay a word of meteorology C. Lamarc has
publislied a meteorological journal, in which he gives a great
many observations, and indicates the variations of the seasons
which may be supposed to take place in the course of the year.
The minister of the interior has established a meteorological
correspondence     to multiply observations; and Lamarc, who
solicited this establistiment, will make it advantageous to the
science,   which is still in its infancy.
    C. Burckhardt, also, has written a long and curious work
on meteorology.      He has examined 15,000 observations of
the barometer, that he may be able to calculate the influence
of the winds ; and he has found that the south wind gives for
mean height 27 inches 11*3 lines, while the east gives 28
inches 1*9 line.     He has found also that the height on the
borders of the Mediterranean sea is 28 inches 2'2 lines, and
on those of the ocean 28 inches 2'8 lines.
    Well placed weather-cocks are very rare at Paris. There
is none at the observatory, though I requested one on being
appointed director; and I have thanked, in name of all ob
servers, C. Bois, tinman, who having built a house on the
Quai des Augustins, has erected there a loftv and very move-
able weather-cock, with letters indicating the four cardinal
points, which will be on a line with a meridian I have ttaced
out on the quay. Astronomers, when they go to the Insti
tute or the Board of Longitude,       will have an opportunity of
seeing conveniently    the  direction of the wind; and the same
advantage will be enjoyed by the inhabitants of that vast
quay, of the Louvre, and the surrounding houses, which
                                                                had.

 conductors, which are not very interesting.
     On the 3d of November there was in the Baltic a terrible
 storm, which destroyed some vessels, and was felt even at
 Brest. On the 7th there was a storm in Provence, which
    reduced 73 lines of water in 2'. hours by a wind at S.S.E.
 f t did very great damage at Marseilles;         several persons pe-
 ristied in the neighbourhood, and the loss amounts to some
 millions.      C. Thulis has found some memorandums of the
 storms of July 12, 1748; September 4, 1764; and Septem
ber 15, 1772: but no person had any remembrance of a
 storm like that of the present year.        The plain of the Po was
exposed to an immense inundation.
     The Class of the Physical and Mathematical Sciences on
the 16th of April chose three astronomers,           who were pre
sented to the general assembly for the place of associate, va
cant by the death of      C   St. Jacques, viz. C. Vidal, Sepman-
ville, and Bernard.
     The first is an uncommon observer, who has alone made
more observations of Mercury than all the astronomers of the
world since 2000 years. The section of astronomy had presented
also C. Pictet of Geneva, Chabrol (de Riom), and Quenot,
officers in the navv.       I even made out a list of the astrono
mers known in France, which contained C. Henry, returned
from Peterfburgh ; Nouet and Beauchamp, returned from
the Levant ; C. Deratte and Poitevin, of Montpellier ; Ber-
nier and Bissv, who embarked with captain Baudin; Cheva
lier, In the department of foreign assairs ; Kramp, of Co
logne; Duvaucel, at Evreux; Guerin, at Amboise; Mongin,
at la Grand- Combe-des-Bois ; Maingon and Lancclin, at
Brest; Jacotot, at Dijon; Planpain and Degrand, at Mar
seilles.    If we   add to these the six astronomers     associated at
the Institute, it will be seen that this science, the most un
profitable and the most neglected, liill furnishes subjects in
France.        As soon as the happy event of peace exalted the
hopes    of  literary men, I took advantage of it to solicit from
all quarters, that astronomy might participate in the benefits
ofit.
     The Academy of Peterfburgh        has transmitted to me a small
            which it has been accustomed for thirty years to
  end me for the good of astronomy; and the emperor of
fwesent,
Russia has approved the desire of the Academy in that respect.
     The king of Etruria has promised to patronize astronomy
at Florence. The observatory is already provided with excel
lent instruments, and Fabroni has assured me that an ob
server will be placed in it: he has requested one of my pu-
     Vol. XII.      No. 47.           0                          pils;

 pils  ; and this circumstance makes me regret that I. bare not
  a greater number.
     General Jourdan gives me reason to hope that the observa
  tory of Turin will be put in a proper state ; and C. Vaffallr,
  president of the academy, affords me hopes also.
     The minister of the marine has given orders that new ob
  servations (hall be made at Brest on the tides, according to
  my request, in order to complete my Trait-: du Flux et Jit
  Reflux cle la Mer, which I wrote to confirm the excellent
  theory of Laplace in his Mecbanique Celeste, and to ascer
  tain what influence the wind has on the tides.
     We requested the first consul to procure us from Spain
  two thousand pounds weight of platina, to construes a tele
  scope of 36 feet ; and we have reason to hope for it.         Our
  telescope  will,  perhaps,  surpass that of Hersehel.
     The   observatory   of Paris has acquired C. Agoustene. The
  minister of the interior, C. Cliaptal, has agreed that the
  Board of Longitude may increase its expenses for this new
  assistant; and I have obtained C. Giroult, whole youth and
  assiduity give me new aid, and leave me no other regret
  than that of not being able to procure a <rreater number.
      In my History of Astronomy for 1800, I mentioned the
  loss which astronomy had sustained on the 5th of November
  that year by the death of Ramsden : to him we have been
  indebted, during the course of twenty years, for the belt and
  largest instruments, the most perfect telescopes, and the most
  ingenious ideas.      Troughton, at present, is the most cele-
'brated artist in England, and is preparing to indemnify us
  for this loss. He has already made excellent instruments j
  and C. Pictet, of Geneva, lately brought us some of them.
      On the 10th of P'ebruary we lost C. St. Jacques de Svlva-
  belle, director of the observatory of Marseilles, who distin
  guished himself by theoretical researches in 1753, as mav be
  seen in the Philosophical Transactions, and then by useful
  observations: he was 79 years of age, and was still usefully
  employed.      His eulogy will appear in the journal of the Ly-
  cæum of his department.
     He has been succeeded by Thulis, who has long been as
  sistant director of the observatory.    The latter made proselytes
  and pupils C. Planpain and C. Degrand; but they have both
  left us, to the great loss of astronomy.
      In the month of December 1800, Matteucci died at Bo
  logna : to him we are indebted for the last volumes of the
  Ephemerides of Bologna, which go as far as 1 810. He has

  notti, and Matteucci,   have rendered    interesting for a  century
 past.
     Chdligni  died lately at Madrid ; lie had long made ob
 servations  and calculations, by which he has been known
 with advantage as an astronomer.
     M. Chevalier has died at Prague : he made useful observa
 tions at Lisbon in 1759, and 3t Brussels.
    On the 8th of October, Gabriel de Bory died at Paris,
 aged 81 : he undertook a journey to Spain in 1751, and in
 1758 went to Portugal and Madeira to determine their posi
 tion. His observations are in the Memoires of 1768, p. 270,
 and in those of 1772, part ii.        In the Memoires of 1770
 he gave a description of a portable observatory, and in the
 third volume of the Sav ns Etrangers an observation of the
 transit of Mercury in 1753. In 1751 he published a descrip
 tion of a marine octant : he diffused a taste for observations
 through the royal n aw : being cbef d'efcadre and governor
 of the windward islands, he had means of contributing to
 excite emulation, and he always employed them.              In 1765
 he was therefore elected a free associate of the Academy of
 Sciences, and in 1798 member of the Institute.
    The Academy and Institute have always been sensible how
mitch need we have os enlightened fellow-labourers to im
 prove our knowledge of navigation, the most difficult of all
arts, and the most important of all sciences for the prosperity
and ereatness of states.
    But the greatest loss sustained by astronomy is that of Jo
seph Beauchamp.       He was born at Vezoul on the 2yth of
June 1752.      His observations at Bagdad in Persia, and on
the Black sea, were as laborious to him as they were im
port. mt to us.     He set out in 1795 as French consul for
Malcate in Arabia ; and he wrote to me on his departure
as follows: "Remember my attachment to you and to astro
nomy."      He left indeed, with some regret, a country and
family who were dear to him : he is certainly one of the
martyrs to astronomy.       He set out for Constantinople on the
25th of September; we expected him with the greatest im
patience, but he had scarcely arrived in Provence when he
fell a prey to a maladv of which he had not been properly
cured. He died at Nice on the 19th of November 1801.
Eight days before his death the section of astronomy had pre
sented him to the vacant place in the Institute.         1 published
a notice of his labours in the Moniteur of Dec. 15, 1801.

XXXVIII. Analysis of the Arseniates of Copper and of Iron*

    One hundred parts of this ore, boiled with dilute nitric
acid, left a yellowish white residuum, which weighed 17.
These 17, exposed to a degree of heat sufficient to volatilize
the sulphur, left 5, which were silica. The liquor from which
this residuum had been separated by filtration, upon being
tried for all the different metals, and particularly for arsenic,
afforded no traces of any thing but copper and iron.                 A co
pious precipitate took place by the affusion of ammonia; the
copper was redilfolved by adding an excess ; and then obtained
by volatilizing that alkali, and boiling with potash, after the
filter had separated the iron already precipitated. The contents

    In this   ore,   I believe, for the following reasons, that the
metals are in the state 1 have marked. First, the propor
tions in the ore announce it ; for I always had an excess of
weight in the total result, if 1 did not deduct; such a propor
tion of oxygen as might be contained in 30 parts of copper.
    Secondly, there is a considerable disengagement of nitrous
gas.
    Thirdly, the ore does not attract the loadstone.
    And, fourthly, the greater part of the iron (but none of
the copper) is dissolved in muriatic acid, forming a greoa
muriate of iron, without disengagement of hydrogen gas.
    No. V11I. Gray vitreous copper ore. (See pa^e 6.) There
are many intermediate states between this ore and the yellow
hematitic copper ore; but they are not fair objects of che
mical analvsis, being merely mixtures of both kinds, in dif
ferent proportions.            The mineralogist, indeed, may dwell
upon    them,    as  interesting in studying the products of nature,
but they are unsatisfactory subjects for the chemist.
   * This   and the following ('Mo.   VIII.)  being the matrices upon which
the arseniates of copper and of iron are generally found, I thought it right
to give an analysis of than also.
                                                                      Gray

    Although       I   have mentioned, in the preceding statements,
only a single analysis of each specimen, it is by no means to
be imagined, that so small a number would be sufficient to
satisfy inquiry.          None of the above results have been taken
into account, unless confirmed by frequent repetition; and
the probationary experiments have been diversified, as much
as lav in my power, by many different tells, and various che
mical reagents.
    With      regard to the colour 6f some specimens of artniare
of copper, it is easily to be accounted for upon chemical prin
ciples. The mistake under which we have long laboured,
that the green is the real oxide of copper, has happily been
rectified by M. Proust*. Me has proved it to be a particular
substance, (to which he has given the very improper name of
hydrate of coppers,) endowed with peculiar properties, and
composed of the brown oxide, and of water, in a state of
combination.            From his experiments, and from what I my
self have seen, I am inclined to draw the conclusion, that we
have never vet obtained by art any real salt of oxide of copper.
In examining, for instance, sulphate of copper, we findit to
afford blue crystals ; and to contain a known quantity of
water of crystallization, and of what we formerly called the
oxide.      But that oxide still retains a quantity of water, of
which when it is deprived it passes to a very dark brown, and
changes its chemical nature and properties.

   f  Copper    is not  the only metal capable of a similar combination.  Co
balt, nickel, and uranium, enjoy the fame propertv.         This may, in some
measure, explain the change of colour which the liquid muriates of       some
of these metals undergo by gentle heat ; it may likewise throw some      light

    If, upon that brown oxide, a sufficient quantity of dilute
sulphuric acid is poured, it yields a blue salt, but in a pro
portion greater by about 24 per cent, than if the green sub
stance had been employed.             I imagine, therefore, that the
firfl operation   of this  brown     oxide is, to assume the quantity
of  water  necessary   to constitute   a hydrate ; and, that the com
bination of sulphuric acid takes place, not between the oxide,
but between the hydrate and that acid, to form a salt, which,
when crystallized, has taken another portion of water in the
act of crvflallizalion.      It is a well known fact, that there is
a state of concentration, when an aqueous solution of muriate
of copper, gently heated, will change from a blueish green
to a beautiful brown, which, upon cooling, or by the affu
sion of water, resumes its former tinge.           This brown liquor
is probably a solution of muriate of copper; while the blue
liquor, like every green or blue solution of a cupreous fait, is
a combination of the acid and the hydrate, or (as we should
say in this cafe) a muriate of hydrate of copper.            It is true,
I  have not been able to produce, so often as I could wish, this
change of colour.        I can, however, adduce the following in-,
stance, as being much in favour of my opinion.
    It is evident that oxide of copper (for so I shall henceforth
call the brown substance) has a very strong affinity for water;
because the fixed alkalis, (unless when boiled upon it,) and
their carbonates, all of which easily decompose the salts of
copper, cannot dispossess the hydrate of copper of its water.
    This led me to imagine that I could perhaps, by fire, dis
sipate not only the water of crystallization, but that contained
in the hydrate; and leave the acid, if a potent one, still in
the salt.     But I found that the affinity of the alkali, acting
upon the acid, hud, in the humid way, determined an order
of combination not to be effected bv heat; for even sulphuric
acid was expelled before the water of the hydrate could be
completely dissipated. Upon reflecting on the fixity of acids,
I could find none so proper for this experiment as the phos
phoric.      I therefore prepared some artificial phosphate of
copper, by precipitating the nitrate of that metal by phos
phate of soda.      When washed and dried, it was in the form
of a sine blueish green powder, among which many crystals
were discernible almost to the naked eye.
    One hundred parts of this, exposed to a gmtle red heat,
became of a much paler green, but passed entirely to brown
when the temperature was sufficiently elevated.            I had then
a brown phosphate, not of hydrate, but of oxide of copper,
and from which no acid had been volatilized.                 Its lots of
weight    was  wholly   from  the  water   which  had  been   expelled,
                                                                    and

     1 could  easily produce, by the fame method, a pale green,
 or a brown arleniate; and, in nature also, the colour of the
 ore accurately corresponds with the proportion of water, as
 may be seen by comparing together any of the foregoing
 analyses.
     Having thus convinced myself, by analysis, that copper is
 found in nature united with arsenic acid in different propor
 tions, I next wished to ascertain whether art could effect
 similar combinations.       For this purpose, I poured into arse-
 niate of ammonia, a solution of nitrate of copper.      The me
 tallic arleniate was immediately precipitated in crystalline
grains, of a blue colour, rather more intense than the phos-
         already mentioned ; and the liquor, which remained
   lue, was decanted.
Ehate                      The colour which this latter retained,
 I imagined, was due to the presence of a greater quantity of
nitrate of copper than was necessary to precipitate, from its
alkaline basis, the arsenic acid combined with the copper. After
a partial evaporation, T poured in alcohol ; and found, to my
surprise, that the consequence was another precipitation,
which was much increased by allowing the liquor to remain.
Crystals still more rich in colour than the former, and very
evidently rhomboidal, even to the naked eye, were gradually
formed.      Imagining there must be some essential cause of
the greater solubility of the one than of the other, I resolved
to examine them apart.
    One hundred parts of the first of those precipitates, exposed
to a low red heat, lost 22. Boiled with potash, there remained
undissolved a blackish brown powder, which, well washed and
dried, weighed 50. The supernatant liquor, saturated with
                                0 4                         nitric

nitric    acid, and evaporated, was precipitated by nitrate of
lead.     Upon filtration, 82 were left, which indicate 27 of
arsenic acid.      Therefore this arfeniate of copper contained,
                   Copper                            50

      The  second artificial compound, which was mentioned
 above, was evidently more soluble than the latter; and ana
 logy might lead us to suspect, in arguing from the generality
 of salts the balis of which is supersaturated, that it contained
 an excess of acid.     It was analysed in the same manner as
 the last, and afforded,

      Thus then have we two artificial arsemates of copper, one
  of which intimately corresponds with one of those which wa
  have recognized among the productions of nature. The other
  poffiblv will he found, but we are not yet in posseflion of it ;
  for I (hall presently mention the reason why No. I., although
  containing 39 of acid, cannot fairly be esteemed as such.
  I   have not yet been so fortunate as to form the other com
  binations,    but do not doubt that art may one day succeed in
  obtaining them.
                              REMARKS.
      Before I conclude this section, which hitherto has had for
  its object a particular account of certain kinds of copper ore,
  as well as or their matrices, it may not be superfluous to offer
   a few remarks, not foreign to the present subject,        upon some
   methods generally used in the docimallic art.           To prove the
   presence ot different substances in fostils, is an object of deli
   cate research : but, to determine proportions with accuracy,
   is the most difficult operation of analytic chemistry, and
   often eludes investigation. It is rather a pleasing reflection to
   think that we are in the infancy of chemical exactness; and
   that we may fee the day of improvement, when the errors
   which we now commit will require al! the aid of self-compla
                                            '
   cency to be in the least excused.          nd it may be of more real
   utility to state with frankness, although we cannot account
    for them, those anomalous appearances which so frequently
    occur, than to court the phantom of rigid accuracy, the re
                                                                   ality

                           is   Copper and      of Iron.                              317
atity of which we can as yet, but in a few instances, be sure
we have attained.           For every observation, however trivial, of
this kind, will hasten the arrival of that moment when we
fliall be enabled to approach a little nearer to truth.
    I have, for many reasons, preferred boiling the nitrate of
copper with either of the fixed alkalis, to the method gene
rally recommended, which              is,  to precipitate all the copper
from its solvent,          bycarbonate of potash or of soda            then, to
                                                                            ;
redissolve in muriatic acid          ;  and to precipitate, in the me
tallic state,    by   a plate of polished iron.
     First, when an alkaline carbonate                  used, the precipitate
                                                         is
is a   carbonate of hydrate of copper             ;and this substance                is   so
luble in an excess of the precipitant.                Ionce evaporated some
 very beautiful blue liquor, obtained in an operation of this
 kind, and found          acrystallized salt, which           became desirous
                                                                I
 to examine.         But, as the solution contained another salt,
 formed     by   the acid (which originally held the copper                          in   so
 lution)    and   the alkali employed,          found
                                                I           necessary to form
                                                              it
 some hydrate of copper directly for the purpose.
     Some hydrate of copper was therefore prepared,                     decom   by
 posing     the   nitrate   of that  metal        by
                                                   a  very   dilute  solution  of
 potash,     and   well  washing     and   drying    the  precipitate       was  :   it
  that fine powder formerly well known a? the oxide of copper.
  Some of this substance was thrown into                       solution of car
                                                                a
  bonate of potash, through which                 acurrent of carbonic acid
  had been made to pass for          a   long time, and they were then
  slightly   heated    together.      One   part of the hydrate became
  of the fame colour as the real oxide; the other was dissolved,
  and the liquor was converted into                   greenish blue solution.
                                                      a
  Thus, one part of the hydrate had yielded its water to the
  other, in order to favour this quadruple, or rather this double
  combination, of carbonate of potash and hydrate of copper:
  the liquor, when reduced, afforded                mass, which, repeatedly
                                                     a

   of potash, holding          little copper.

 21 8                       Analysis    of the     Arseniates
 to retain a much greater quantity.     This, therefore, is a suf
 ficient proof of the inaccuracy of attempting to precipitate
 copper from its solutions, by an alkaline carbonate; for car
 bonate of soda has, like carbonate of potash, the property of
 dissolving and crystallizing, as a triple salt, with hydrate of
 copper.
     In addition to this source of error, we may add the very
 uncertain operation of one metal upon the saline combination
 of another, whatever may be their affinity for oxygen.       In
 deed I have so often remarked this very great uncertainty,
 that I was pleased to find the observation had occurred to
 Mr. Proust; and I have constantly found that more depend
 ence can be placed upon the method I have adopted, than
 upon any attempts to precipitate the metals by each other.
     With regard to efficacy and promptness, tin or zinc is pre
ferable lo iron ; but, with any of the three metals, a phæno-
menon occurs, for which I have not been able to account
in any manner the least satisfactory.    As the effects are more
striking   with  zinc  than  with the other metals, I (hall enter
into particulars respecting the use of that metal only.
    When a bit of zinc (or tin, or iron,) is immersed in a so
lution of muriate of copper, a precipitation begins, and all
the copper is finally separated in a few. hours*: but, isa
little muriatic acid is added to this solution, and the zinc
then immersed, a violent effervescence takes place ; hydrogen
gas is disengaged, and, in less than two minutes, the copper
is so completely precipitated in the metallic state, that neither
ammonia, nor even sulphurated hydrogen, can discover any
vestige       of   its presence.
    It would  appear from this, that hydrogen                   is,
                                                      in this cafe,
the real reductive and precipitant of the copper.       Yet, how
can we reconcile the evident contradiction, that, in one cafe,
zinc with muriatic acid will decompose water, that             that       is,
zinc and muriatic acid will attract oxygen more strongly than
hydrogen can, yet that, in the other cafe, hydrogen, whose
affinity for oxygen      weaker than that of zinc and muriatic
                             is
acid, will be more speedy and powerful than zinc and mu
riatic acid, in attracting that oxygen from copper? Again,
how      is  possible that zinc and muriatic; acid will, in pre
               it
ference to taking oxygen immediately from the oxide of cop
per, decompose water, the hydrogen of which will unite with
the oxygen of the oxide of copper, again to become water,

                               by
metallic salt, without acting upon the arsenic.
      If,
        instead of muriatic acid, sulphuric acid         used, the            is
same phænomena take place, in          less degree. a  But,      the                 if

   In the analysis of every ore in which the metal       com                        is
bined with sulphur,       have found much variation in the
                                   I
quantity of the latter which may be obtained, even in expe
riments upon the fame specimen.       If nitric acid used not                  is
sufficiently strong, part of the ore remains untouched, and
will require subsequent treatments always disadvantageous in
                                                                                    delicate

 Ck20                     Analysts   of   the ArfeniaUs
  delicate operations.    If the acid is too strong, a great part of
  the sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid ; so that, in either
  case, there is room for error.     I thought that, to avoid this,
  (except in cafes where any metal which, with sulphuric acid,
 forms an insoluble salt, was present,) strong nitric acid might
 be used, and all the sulphur converted into acid. If potdsh,
 soda*, or ammonia, are used as precipitants of the different
 metals, the quantity of sulphur may be easily ascertained.
 I took a given weight of sulphur, and converted it into sul
 phuric acid by means of nitric acid.        I then neutralized and
 evaporated it.    Nitrate of barytes, poured in, gave a precipi
 tate which, in one experiment, indicated a proportion of
 sulphur equal to 14,4, and in another to 14,6, contained in
 one hundred of sulphate os barvtes.        A difference so trifling
 need not be regarded.      According to M. Lavoisier, sulphuric
 acid contains 71 of sulphur, and 29 of oxygen; and, accord
 ing to the synoptic tables of M. Fourcroy, lulphate of barytes
 contains 33 per cent, of sulphuric acid : therefore, by this
 calculation, one hundred of sulphate of barytes contain 23,43
of sulphur, instead of 14,4, or 14,6. I do not pretend to
                                                           f
account for so great a difference in these results ; but that
very difference led me (by exciting me to doubt those which
I had obtained, and inducing me to frequent repetition,) to
a more positive conviction of the proportions I have men
tioned.    M. Lavoisier obtained his proportions by combus
tion ; and, admitting even that nothing was lost, it must
have been rather difficult to obtain the sulphuric acid in a
state proper to value the quantity.         Indeed I do not know
of any direct experiments which prove, in a satisfactory
manner, that we have ever obtained that. acid perfectly free
from water; unless when combined with an earth, or an
alkali, in some salt, and that salt calcined in a very strong
red heat.
   To ascertain the quantity of metallic arsenic in mispickel,
arsenical pyrites, 8cc. the most advantageous method         to   is,
acidify   it   by
              nitric acid, and then to  combine     with oxide
                                                          it
of lead.  This arseniate of lead (containing, as was before
said, 33,2 per cent, of acid,) may be estimated lo contain
22 per cent, of metallic arsenic.           If
                                      both sulphur and arsenic
are present, lead may be equally serviceable, after both ha\e
been acidified   for sulphate of lead
                    ;                    not materially soluble
                                                 is
in any acid whereas, on the contrary, arseniate of lead
               ;                                                        is
very much so.

   When copper and iron are to be separated, one single affu
sion of ammonia will not always suffice.        That two may be
sometimes necessary, is an objection to the method I propose
tor the subsequent ebullition with potash.        But, when      I
                                                                use
that of precipitating the copper by iron, it requires no pre
vious precipitation by any alkali.    It is sufficient to add mu
riatic acid to the original solution of the ore in nitric acid,
and evaporate to dryness.     The nitric acid is dislodged from
the oxide of copper, and the muriatic takes its place. Isa
single evaporation is not sufficient, a second (for the operation
is very short, and causes no loss upon filters, &c.) may be
attempted ; and when the iron used for the purpose of re
 vivifying the copper is put in, the liquor may be made to
 boil; by which means the process is rendered much more
 certain and expeditious. Some iron will necessarily be dis
 solved, and the quantity must be noted.       The liquor, which
 contained muriate of copper and of iron, now contains only
 the latter.  Boiled with a little nitric acid, it will become
 red ; and then ammonia, or potash, will give a red precipi
 tate, which, well washed and dried, will represent 61 per
 cent, of metallic iron.   All these metals having thus been
 precipitated, no constituent part of the ore, except the sul
 phur, which, in the first treatment, had been converted into
 sulphuric acid, is contained in the liquor; and from      it, when
 neutralized, this latter may be precipitated       bynitrate of ba-
rytes, which will represent 14,6 per cent, of sulphur.  The
absolute necessity of constantly using pure alkalis, in this
method of analysis,    too evident to be insisted upon.
                          is
   GENERAL VIEW OF THE FOREGOING ANALYSES.
    In taking  a   retrospective survey of the experiments above
 related, upon the various natural arfeniates of copper which
 we have examined, we (hall find,
    First, That natural arseniate of copper exists in three dif
 ferent states of combination    the first containing 14 per cent.,
                                     ;
 the second 21 per cent., and the third about 29 per cent, of
 acid.
    Secondly, That each of these may contain different propor
 tions of water, either as constituting  hydrate, or as water
                                             a
 of crystallization.
    Thirdly, That, upon losing its water, arseniate of copper
 will pass from blue to pale green, and finally to brown, as in
 No.   I.
    Fourthly, That No.          the only real arseniate of copper,
                               I.   is
 all the others being arfeniates of hydrate of copper.
    Fifthly, That No.     I,  not to be admitted as an arseniate
                               is
                                                                           of

 222                 Analysis of tie Arseniates
 of  copper containing 39,7 per cent, of acid.     For,  if  we pu(
 it  on the same footing with the others, in admitting a due
              of water into its composition, we shall, by calcul
[>roportion
  ation, reduce it to that class containing 29 per cent.
    Sixthly, That in beginning with that kind which contains
 the   least quantity of acid, and rising progressively     to that
 which contains the greatest, we shall find the order to be thus:
            No. VI. contains        -      14 per cent.
            No. V.      -      -    «      21 per cent.
            Nos. I. III. and IV.    -      29 per cent.
    No. II. seems to be a particular species. It consists of a
much greater proportion of oxide, with a less quantity of
water, (and this its external colour announces,) combined
with nearly the fame proportion of arsenic acid.        Indeed, if
certain characters did not speak so strongly in favour of this
division, I should not have hesitated to class it with the last-
mentioned kinds.        But it is found in many states ; which
seems to indicate, that the water is by no means in the
fame degree of intimate combination that it is in the others ;
and this alone may serve to distinguish it to the eye of the
mineralogist.
    If, to the above natural arseniates, is added the second ar
tificial arseniate, we shall have another proportion of acid, at
the rate of 40 per cent. Here then we have two simple sub
stances combined in four different proportions, and producing
seven distinct combinations.
    But, what is not the least to be admired, is the wonderful
accordance in the order which two sciences, operating with
very different instruments, have allotted to the fame substances.
By that, not only the sagacity of Nature becomes very strik
ing ; but, from the acknowledged accuracy of one method of
investigation, the reliance to ibe placed upon the other is
rendered more conspicuous ; and each receives additional
strength and confirmation.       Chemistry has long been in the
habit of aiding the science of mineralogy, of which it laid
the foundation ; but it was not till lately that crystallography
could form a judgment of its own, much less confirm th«
truth of the source from which it sprung.
                           Section II.
                         Arseniates of Iron.
    The arseniates of iron remain now to be examined. In*
eluded, formerly, among arseniates of copper, they have been
separated from them upon the authority ot chemical analysis.
For, although to recognise, by external character and form
in all their modifications, substances already known, is par
                                                          ticularly

 pitate, as usual ; but the operation was discontinued until              I
 should obtain all the arseniate of copper which I imagined
 to be contained in the ore.             For this purpose, I had re
 course to the 60 parts mentioned above.             They were in the
 form of a greenish gray powder, very hard and gritty, which
 had every appearance of silica, contaminated by a small por
 tion of copper interposed between the molecules of that earth.
 I resolved to treat it in the same manner as all siliceous stones,
and proceeded to boil it with potash.
     In less than three minutes it became of a very red brown,
 from the greenish gray which it originally was ; and seemed
 considerably attenuated in its particles. The liquor was de
 canted, and examined. It was found to contain arsenic acid;
 and the precipitate, which had resisted the action of the pot
 ash, was proved to be a mixture of iron and copper.
    These preliminary experiments were sufficient to indicate a
 ready method of analysis.            100 parts, boiled with potash,
 immediately became of a deep reddish brown.                  The liquor
 was separated from the residuum by filtration; and, after the
 usual neutralization, evaporation, and affusion of nitrate of
 lead, (all   of which     operations were detailed in the first part
 of  this paper,) gave a precipitate corresponding to 35,5 of
    * This   species had been mentioned by Mr. Proust, but in a manner
 which, as it was a new substance, and demanded particular attention, does
 not give all the satisfaction which that chemist generally affords.    No
.doubt   the -scarcity of the ore  prevented his making every necessary re
 search ; and [ may deem myself fortunate in having been   so near the spot
 in which it is found.    My friend Mr. Hatchett very obligingly gave me
 a specimen of this ore, which he had received from Dr. Pallas, who had
 brought it \yith. him from Siberia, where it had been found.
                                                                   arsenic

  None of    these experiments    were sufficient to determine,
whether this ore is in the state of a triple salt, or merely a
mixture of two arseniates.       As, in a ternary combination,
the proportion of acid might vary, it cannot be justly called
in to aid us in our inquiry. The solubility of one part of the
ore being much greater than that of the other, and in dif
ferent quantities of each salt, incline more to the opinion that
it is but a mixture.
                       Simple Arseniate of Iron.
   This arseniate, exposed to any degree os heat, gave but an
Unsatisfactory    result, with regard to the quantity of water.
The arsenic acid is volatilized from this ore with peculiar
facility, for which I (hall attempt hereafter to account.
   Some subsequent experiments, however, have induced me
to fix the quantity of water at about 10,5.
   One hundred parts, boiled with potash, left 58,5.           The
liquor,  treated,  as usual, by nitrate of lead, gave 31 of arsenic
acid. The 58,5 left four, which muriatic acid could not
dissolve, and which were silica.      Ammonia dissolved 9; and
there remained 45,5 of iron.            This   analysis presents the fol

  This   ore appears to be a pure arseniate, mixed accidentally
with a little copper ; as some of the copper arseniates casually
      traces of iron.   This     tlic kind mentioned

                                                                  under

 under that denomination.             Heating it on charcoal, before
 the blowpipe, he perceived a smell of arsenic, and, at length,
obtained a metallic button, which was found to be copper.
 That there is copper in this ore, is evident from analysis. But
 the mere arsenical smell was not a sufficient ground to assert
 that it contained arsenic acid; for this metal might, with as
 much probability, have been in any other state.                   indeed,     If,
 that very accurate and able analyst had, upon trying the ore
with the blowpipe in             platina spoon, perceived no fumes,
                                       a
he might then have concluded that the arsenic must be in
 the state of acid, and that charcoal was necessary to operate
a  partial reduction, to which the arsenic owed its volatility
and its smell.       But no such experiment            reported,  is
     It   isalso rather extraordinary that Mr. Gmelin should
have taken this ore out of the class of arsenical ores, and left
it as an unknown          species of copper; when, in fact,             an           it   is
arsenical ore, but not an arsenical ore of copper.
 I    examined some crystals which are commonly attached to
the specimens of this ore. They were those which, according
to M. de Bournon, are in state of decomposition.

sition. The same theory that accounts for the difficulty of
ascertaining the quantity of water will account for the red
colour they thus assume.

green oxide of iron has taken up oxygen from the acid                  and           ;
this latter has been partly decomposed, and almost totally
volatilized.      Now, in the species here spoken of, the iron, as
in  the  green sulphate,        in the state of green oxide therefore
                                       is                                  ;

place,    when    oxide   of iron, ready to receive, and arsenic acid,
ready   to  yield oxygen, are         contact. A less degree of heat,

therefore, will suffice to drive off this acid, from green arse-
niate of iron, than from arseniate of copper.                But we must
not from this conclude, that the affinity of the latter metal
for arsenic acid        superior to that of the former; for, the at

affinities.
     But most of the mineral acids that have been tried have
been found capable of uniting with iron in two states; in
the state of green oxide, and in that of red oxide, the resi
duary powder above mentioned.              I was desirous to know
whether I could, in any manner, imitate, by art, the last
natural products I have"^ examined, as I had already imitated,
in some degree, an arseniate of copper.             For this purpose,. I
decomposed green sulphate and red sulphate of iron, by arse
niate ot" ammonia; and, having well washed and dried the
 precipitates, proceeded to examine them.
     The green arseniate was acted upon by heat, in the fame
 manner as the natural one, and exhibited the fame appear
 ances.     By the usual methods, I found its proportions to be.
                     Oxide of iron         -      43

     This is not  the fame proportion      of  acid that is contained
 in    the natural arseniate; however,        I state them both as     I
 found them. The other artificial arseniate,             which   is of a
 pale ¦greenish  red, afforded,

                                                   98,0
     These salts agree whin the generality of the known salts
 of iron ; all of which contain a greater quantity of oxide, as
 the oxide itself contains less oxygen.
     Bv boiling with nitric acid, it was easy to^ convert the green
 arseniate of iron into the red ; and such is the cafe with all
 the laits of green oxide of iron.         As, during the course of
 these experiments, I had occasion to make some remarks
 upon the divers habitudes of this metal, which, as far as             I
 know, have not all been observed, I sliall terminate the whole
  of these analyses (as I have already done that part of them
 which, treats of arseniate of copper in all its known

 by limply staling what has occurred to me.
      I happened to boil some muriatic" acid upon a greater
  quantity of iron than the acid could dissolve.         I found a per-
  fecily limpid and colourless liquor remain, which, neverthe
  less, was a solution of muriate of iron.      This colourless liquor
  hung decomposed by        arseniate   of ammonia, the precipitate
                                                                    was

                                          an excess of ammonia
remained in the solution.       In endeavouring to distil, or to
evaporate, the water of this colourless solution, in order to
obtain crystals,    became of
                     it              light green, the intensity of
                                         a
which augmented, as the distillation was continued.           could      I
not, therefore, hope to procure this fait in crystalline form.

  This solution of white muriate of iron, when                         exposed to
the air, becomes green,            and   is   then in the         state of green

have observed the precipitate formed, to be soluble in the car
bonates of potash and of loda, and still more        in that of     so
ammonia; but, upon absorption of oxygen, to be quickly
abandoned       by
                them, and then to fall to the bottom, in                       a

green muriate of iron nitric acid        poured, both liquors

the liquor becomes red, but still gives a blaekisti green pre
cipitate; but, if it is boiled with nitric acid, it then is con
verted into a red liquor, which yields a red precipitate, by all
the alkalis and earths capable of causing a precipitation. From
these observations,     upon the different combinations of iron
with oxygen, and of oxide of iron with muriatic acid, some
conclusions may be drawn interesting to mineralogy as well
as to chemistry.      The variety of colour in many stones in
which iron has been found, is a fact which, although we
cannot deny our assent to direct experiments, has never been
accounted for in a satisfactory manner.             In white, green,
yellow,   black,  red ; in a word,  in fossils of  every  colour, iron,
with sometimes the help of manganese, and lately of chro
mium, has been regarded as the colouring matter of every
shade; but it seems almost paradoxical, that the fame sub
stance should assume and cammunicate so many tints.                  In
mica, kaolin, amianthus, asbestos, rock crystal, and all
white stones, [ believe it to exist as the white oxide ; and
that state is its first degree of combination with oxygen.
In them, this metal is not very abundant; for, if it were, I
have some reason (as stiall be proved immediately) to think
that they would obey the loadstone strongly. In lapis ollaris,
serpentines,   and many green stones, we have the green ox
ide ; and most of these are magnetic ; nay, as Mr. Humboldt
has observed, serpentines enjoy the property of polarity. And
thence I conclude, that the rarity of this metal, in the first
class, prevents them from participating that quality.              This
I  believe to be its second stage of combination with oxygen.
In the state of black oxide it is frequently found, and is too
well known to need further comment.               I believe this to be
its third stage of oxidation. But there is a red liquid muriate,
which gives a very dark greenish precipitate, approaching to
dark brown.      What the state of that precipitate         is,
                                                              I    have
not yet determined but imagine
                      ;     I            it  to be
                                                 a   mixture of black
 and red. Brown and yellow oxides,       I    am confident, are mix
 tures of simple oxides, and neither of them         is  an oxide sui
generis.    The red oxide   is  the extreme of oxidation, and af
 fords many beautiful colours in nature and in art.
    It    much to be desired, for the advancement of analytic
         is
 chemistry, that experiments upon the proportions of oxvgen
 with which metals are capable of uniting, under different cir
 cumstances,    and upon the combination of those oxides with
 all the known acids, together with many others of their pro
 perties, would attract the notice, and engage the labours, of
 accurate manipulators.       Experiments of this kind have been
 despised, from an idea of their resembling     a    mere mechanical

    nish materials for a new map of Great Britain, were under
    taken, about 25 years ago, in England, and have been car
    ried on since that time. These labours, begun by the late
    general Roy, have b|(en conducted with a great deal of sa
   gacity and precision, and the results of them may afford in
   teresting data in regard to the figure of the earth.   A distin-
             member of the Royal Society of London, Sir George
      chuckburgh, has employed himself, with success, in re
   fuished
   searches calculated     to establish the precise length of the
   standards, which have served as a basis to all the geodesiaa
   measurements made in England.
       It was therefore to be regretted that labours so analogous
   in their nature, carried on in two neighbouring countries, and
   susceptible of acquiring, by comparison, a new degree of in
   terest, should remain unconnected for want of a real standard
   of the measures of one of these countries, viz. England. We
   experienced     this regret in a very lively manner at different
   periods ; and we can with truth assert, that if the hope of
   procuring this mean of comparison was not the only motive
   of the journey undertaken by one of us to England, it was a
  strong inducement towards it.
       Our colleague, professor Pictet, when he arrived at Paris,
  took some steps to obtain an authentic metre, in order that
  he might submit it to examination before the Royal Society
  of London, of which he is a member; but, in consequence
  of the stiortness of his stay in Paris, these steps were not at
  tended with the desired effect.      He, however, took advantage
  of a longer residence in England to procure from Troughton,
 an artist celebrated for his accuracy in constructing and di
 viding geometrical and astronomical instruments, a standard
 exactly similar to one he had constructed for Sir George
 Schuckburgh, and to which that philosopher referred the
 principal English measures in the memoir above mentioned.
 Our colleague also caused to be constructed by the same"
 artist the comparative apparatus of Sir George Snuckburgh,
 consisting of two excellent microscopes, one of which is fur
 nished with a micrometer that divides the English inch into
 ten thousand equal parts.         On his return to Paris he took
 the earliest opportunity of laving these articles before the

 ExlraSl from       the Regijhrs of the Class ; Sitting of the
              6tl> Nivofe, Ytar jo (Dec. 27, 1801.)
   A member, in name of a commission, read the following
report on a comparison of the standard metre of the Institute
with the English foot :
   " C. Pictet, professor of philosophy at Geneva, submitted
to the class, in the month of Vcndemiaire last, an interesting
collection of objects relating to the sciences and the arts,
which he procured during his travels in England.
   " Among these objects was a standard of the English mea
sures on a brass ruler, strong and well polished, about 49
English inches in length, 36 of which make the English yard,
and divided along its whole length, by lines exceedingly fine,
into tenths of an inch.
   " This standard was constructed, at the request of C. Pictet,
by Troughton, an artist of London, who has the well-earned
reputation of dividing instruments with great accuracy : it
was compared at London with another standard made by the
lame artist (or Sir George Schuckburgh, and it was found
that the diflerence between these two standards was no mofe
than the diflerence between each of the divisions, that is to
lay, quantities absolutely insensible.
   " The standard of C. Pictet, then, ought to be considered
as identical with that of Sir George Schuckbargh : a detail
ot the experiments which ascertain the exactness of the latter,
may be seen in the Philosophical Transactions for 1798.
   " C. Pictet had laid before the Institute,' together
                                                      ~
                                                             with
                                P4                              the

234            Comparison    is the "Definitive Metre
the above rule, divided into tenths of an inch, a comparer dr
instrument proper for estimating the small differences between
the measures, constructed by the fame artist, and of which
the following is a short description :
    " The comparer is composed of two microscopes with
threads, which are placed in a vertical situation.       The faces
of the rule to be examined being horizontal, and at a con
venient distance from each other, by making them move
along a metal rod with divisions, one of the microscopes re
mains fixed near one of the extreme lengths of the point to
be compared, and serves to assure the immobility of that
 point; the second microscope is towards the other extremity
of the fame length, and fixed also; but the frame which bears
 these threads may be moved bv means of a micrometer screw
 the threads of which arc equal to -,,%th of an inch English ;
 and the plate passed over by the index being divided into an
other 100 parts, gives -rti^th of an inch English for every
 division of the plate.    By means of this arrangement, if the
 microscopes   are first placed in such a manner that the inter
 sections of their threads correspond to the extremities of any
 length intended to be compared with another which differs
from it by a quantity less than x-ioth of an inch, the dif
ference of the two lengths, by employing the micrometer,
 may be estimated in to, oooth parts of an inch.
    " The threads placed in the focus are disposed obliquely
 in regard to the lines of division, so that a correspondence is
 known to have taken place when a line of division divides
 into two equal parts the acute angle formed by the two
 threads.
    " We shall here observe, that, in the year 1785, Ramsden
 employed, in the like manner, two microscopes,        adapted to
 au' instrument he had invented        to measure the dilatation of
 metals.    General Rov gave a description of this instrument
in the 75th volume of llie Philosophical Transaction?.
    " C. Pictet offered to entrust the class with the English
 standard and the comparer above described, to enable them
 to determine the ratio of the metre to the English foot : the
 class accepted this offer with gratitude, and charged C. Lc-
 gendre, Mechain, and myself, (Prony,) to join with
 C. Pictet in order to determine the ratio between the
 standard of the plasma metre and the English foot.
    " The following is a stiort account of the result of the
 labour undertaken on this subject at the house of Lenoir for
 a first comparison:
    " The 49 inches of the English rule terminate at divisions
 traced out on one of the faces of that rule : and the standards
                                                                 of

            with   the Standard  of the English Measures.               333
of platina and iron of the Institute have no division, the length
of the metre being given by the distance between their ex
tremities.      This circumstance prevented, on the one hand,
the length of a metre from being taken immediately on the
standards with the microscopes ; and, on the other, did not
permit the immediate estimation of the metre of the Institute
in Englisti inches, by the process employed for fixing the
standard of the new measures ; a process which consists in
resting the extremity of the metal rule subjected to examina
tion against the knee of a fixed gauge, and applying to the
other extremity a sliding knee, constructed for estimating the
difference between the measures, the ratio of which is to be
determined, or the identity of which is to be ascertained.
    " The artist Lenoir tried to surmount these obstacles by
employing a copper rule, a metre in length, cut at its extre
mities into a very sharp bevel, in such a manner, that this
rule could be compared with the standard of the Institute
according to the usual method of extreme contact, and which
 being placed above the English rule, the edges of the bevel
 produced on the surface or that rule the effect of divisions
 parallel to those delineated upon it. By these means, the
microscopes       could be used for estimating in inches, and ten
thousandth parts of an inch, the distance between these edges.
    " By this method, the standard metre of platina, and an
other metre of iron, both belonging to the Institute, were
compared with the Englisli foot ; the two former measures
being constructed in such a manner, that at the temperature,
of melting ice they are equal to each other and to the ten
 millionth part of a quarter of the meridian.                 It was found
 that at the temperature of i$'$ degrees of the centigrade
 thermometer the platina metre was equal to 39*3775, and
 the iron metre to 39*3788 English inches, measured on the
 rule of C. Pictet.
     " But these first observations made known to the commis
 sioners that the process they employed might leave some un
certainty, in consequence of the great difficulty of placing the
 intersection of the threads at the exact extremity of the bevel
 of the rule, which served as a term of comparison. A reflec
 tion or irradiation of light which took place at that extremity,
 prevented our clearly distinguishing whether the optic axis
 of the microscope was exactly tangent to the small surface
 which terminated that bevel.
     " To remedy this inconvenience, one of the commissioners*
    * This method, as simple as ingenious,  was proposed by C. Prony ; and
 C. Paul of Geneva, who was accidentally      present, carried it into execu
 tion : it «at attended with complete success.
                                                                    proposed

»34        Comparison   of the Definitive Metre, &c.
proposed the following method, which was adopted : —          It
consisted in tracing out, on a small flip or rule of metal,   of
the same thickness as the English rule, a very delicate line
perpendicular to the length of the rule. This piece of metal
was made to rest against a fixed knee, and the microscope
with fixed threads was brought to the line above mentioned :
the piece of metal containing that line was then removed,
and the metre to be compared was put in its room, with one
of its extremities resting against the fixed knee, and the piece
of metal placed at the other. It is here evident that the line
traced out on the piece of metal was in this new position at
the exact distance of a metre from its former position when
resting against the fixed knee; and, by making the thread*
of the second microscope correspond with this line, the di
stance between the points of intersection of the two threads
was exactly a metre.       To estimate the metre in English
inches, nothing then was necessary but to put into its room
the divided rule, to place a line of one of its divisions under
that of the intersection of the threads which was fixed, and
to estimate at the other extremity, by means of the micro
meter, the fraction of division, which with the whole num
ber of these divisions gave the length of the metre.
   " The comparison was repeated on the 4th of Brumairc
at the house os one of the commissioners by the method here
described ; and after several observations, which corresponded
in a very satisfactory manner, it was found that, at the tem
perature of 1 2* 75 degrees of the centigrade thermometer, the
platina standard of the metre was 39*378 1, and the iron
standard 39/3795 English inches.
   " The two metres having been constructed to be equal at
the temperature of freezing, the operation from which the
preceding results were obtained may be verified by finding
what the ratios would be at that temperature.      For this de
termination we have the correct experiments of Borda, and
the commission of weights and measures on the dilatation ot
platina, copper, and iron, from which it results, that for
one degree of the centigrade thermometer, platina dilates
0-00000856,      iron 0-00001156, and copper 000001783;
and from these data it is found that, at the temperature of
freezing, the platina metre of the Institute is equal to
39*38280, and the iron metre to 39*38265 English inches,
measured on the standard of C. Pictet.
   " The difference 000015 between these two lengths, less
than Ticth of a line, or T^V^th of a metre, may be abso
lutely neglecled. The result of our labour therefore    is,that,
supposing the platina and iron standards of the metre belong

     Observations on the duration of the Life of these Birds .
  J!\ O one      can know better than you do, that it is impossible
 to have      the natural history ot birds so complete as that of
 quadrupeds. To render it more perfect, we must collect, as
 you have done, all the new facts and correct observations
 made since the immortal Buffon published his work, in order
that we may form a new one still more complete.                That  I
may contribute towards this branch of natural history, permit
 me to fend you an account of an interesting fact, viz. the
history of two parrots of the family of the Amazons, which
 laid eggs several times, and which have reared a young one,
brought forth at Rome in the course of the present year 1801.
     1st, I shall first give you a history of these parrots, with
tea account of their laying and incubation.
     2d, Of their habits and attachment, and in what manner
they reared the young one.
    3d, I shall examine the species to which they belong : I
shall give a description of the male, the female, and the
young parrot, and compare them with those given by orni
thologists.
    4th, I shall relate some very rare cases of parrots hatched
in our climates, and the difficulties that oppose this circum
stance.

 there is a constant relation between the time employed ia
 incubation and the duration of their life.
     I. History of the Parrots, their Laying and Incubation.
    The    parrots of which      I am going so give the history, be
 long to   M. Passeri, a Roman.
    In  the first place,  I must express my gratitude to the owner
 for having permitted me to examine and observe them very
 closely, and for having communicated to me the observations
 which either he or his mother had an opportunity of making,
 for sixteen years, on the manners and habits of these birds,
which enables me to give a correct history of them.
    M. Passeri obtained at Marseilles, in 1786, a female parrot
of the family of the Amazons.             Some months after, he got,
at Avignon, a male under the name of the Amazon parrot of
Brazil. He put them together, being both tame, and suf
fered them to go about the house at their pleasure.                   They
never had a small chain on their legs, nor any other badge
of slavery.      They often remained on the stick placed for
them, and sometimes they retired in the night to a large
iron cage which was not (hut; and in every other place
where they have since been, thev have always enjoyed the
fullest liberty.     From the moment thev saw each other, they
conceived a strong mutual attachment, the cause of which,
no doubt, was their difference of sex;> and their friendship
still continues to such a degree, that if separated for a few-
moments they are in the greatest agitation, emit loud cries,
and their uneasiness continues till they are again brought to
gether.     When they came into the possession of. M. Passeri
they had attained to their full growth, but he had no know
ledge of their age.
    The male pronounced distinctly several French words, as
it does still ; but the female emits only loud cries, and chat
ters very much, without articulating a single word.                   They
have travelled a great deal with their master, being first car
ried to Rome, thence to Forti, Valentano, and Nagni, and
again back to Rome : during these journevs they were (hut
up separately in small wooden boxes called sabots *.
    The female laid eggs several times. The first time this
circumstance was observed was at Forti, about five years
ago. She produced two eggs, which slie deposited in a hole
near the kitchen chimney; but the incessant noise of the
people going backwards and forwards, prevented her from
continuing to hatch them. Besides, unforeseen circumstances
obliged the owner to change his residence.
   • This method of c; frying birds is very
                                            convenient ; for, as they cannot
turn themselves, they do not spoil their plumage.
                                                                       The

              Account os a Parrot hatched at Home.                           237
     The second time was at Valentano, where she produced
two eggs, which she deposited in a corner of the room, with
out preparing any nest.      Having fat on them some days, it
was then concluded that it would be better to place them
under a pigeon ; but, though the pigeon fat on them for a
considerable time, they were not hatched .
     The female laid for the third time last year (1800). She
produced two eggs about the middle of May, and deposited
them on the ground ; but some days after they were found
broken. Whether it was done by the male that he might
enjoy the female again, or whether it happened by some
other cause, is not known.         In the beginning of June, how
                        two         *
ever, she again laid          eggs ; but she deposited them this
time in an earthen vessel which, the handle of it being broken,
was employed as a chaffing-dish : it was half silled with ashes,
and stood behind a door which concealed the female while
fitting.
     The female fat for forty days, and on the 25th of July
one of the eggs was hatched ; but the young one died next
morning.
     As M. Passeri was desirous to confirm the fact of a parrot
being hatched at Rome, he carried it to the hospital of San-
Spirito ; but putrefaction being too far advanced, it was
thrown away. It was seen, however, by several of the young
surgeons at that institution.
     The fourth, or rather the fifth time, that the female laid,
(for she had laid once besides the three times above men
tioned,) was in the present year 1801.             She deposited three
eggs     in the fame  vessel  filled  with     ashes, which stood in
the fame place as before.       The incubation lasted forty days,
and on the 24th of June a young one was hatched : some
days after, the other eggs were thrown away as unfruitful.
This young parrot is at present in good health, and as large
as a pigeon.
   '
     It remained almost naked for the first fortnight, being co
vered only with soft down : the small gray tubes of the quills
then began to appear, and from thele issued, like a small
brush, the green feathers, which grew progressively to such a
degree, that on the 20th of August, that is to fay, at about
the end of two months, it was completely clothed.
     On the 12th of July, that     is,  on the 18th day, the young
parrot began    to emit cries  for  the  first time.
     On the 14th, that    is, on the 20th day,         began to open
                                                         it

                             rearing their Young.
     It   has not been         observed      that these parrots speak more
in summer than in winter.                 They did not   seem to suffer any
inconvenience from the heat: yet they wash themselves in
summer, and, when the fun            ardent, place themselves in

the sliacle  :  on the other hand, they seek for the sun                     in
winter.. They seem much affected                change of weather;

and during storms they are under great agitation, and fend
forth loud cries.
    No particular time of their moulting has been remarked                    :
it  takes place gradually in the course of the year.
    These birds copulate only once       year,    a   the spring:    in      it
was always in the latter end of March and beginning of
April that they sliowed figns of it. At this time, the male
redoubles his caresses to the female, which returns them                     by
marks of the greatest sensibility.     They kiss with their bills,
scratch each other, and stroke, one        one, the small feather*
                                                      by
of the head. Sometimes the male, pressing his throat,                        by
a  fort of rumination throws up some morsels he has swal
lowed, and presents them with his bill to his companion,
¦which eats them with great avidity.
    After these preludes, they copulate like pigeons. They co
pulate several times day     athey have been seen to copulate
                                   :
even three times in      morning, and
                             a                  to be presumed that
                                                      it   is
they did     several times more in the course of the day; which
            so
                                              -
proves that they are exceedingly warm.
    According to our observations they construct no nest.
They collected no feathers, bits of straw, or any other light
bodies within their reach.      The female deposited her eggs
in the fame vessel, without carrying any thing to it.
    The eggs are as large as those of pigeon, and are entirely
                                                   a
white.     As some authors have observed that the eggs of the
Amazon parrot are spotted with gray, while thoseof the parrot
in question were white, there       reason to conclude that the
                                             is
state of domesticity has an influence on the colour of the
eggs, as    it has sometimes on that of the plumage.           This
observation did not escape Aristotle *.
    The number of eggs was always two, except once, when
                         *   Hul   Animal, lib. vi.        c    1.
                                                                          there

                Account   of a Parrot    hatched  at Rome.            239
there were three. Though these eggs were often handled,
the female never made the least hesitation to sit upon them*.
     Of the eggs laid this and the preceding year, only one was
hatched.
     The female alone fits on the eggs. The period of incuba
tion is forty days f. The female scarcely ever leaves them,
except to drink, or for any other necessary purpose ; and then
 she immediately returns.         During that time, the male stands
sentinel at a little distance: he is very attentive to the least
noise, and never stirs from the spot but to carry food to the
 female, which he always breaks with his bill during the in
 cubation.
     When the young parrot is hatched, both the old ones
 carry it food. The young one did not begin to eat alone till
 the 70th day.        The old ones continued to cut the food with
 their beaks for more than ten days.
     They gave to the young one the fame food as they used
 themselves.       Being accustomed to every thing, they ale rice,
 meat, paste, Turkey corn, hemp-feed, and fruits ; but they
 were fondest of the feeds of the turnsole, carthamus, melon,
  and cucumber.
      The following fact is highly worthy of attention : — The
  owner seeing that his young parrot increased in size, and
  fearing that the vessel would be too small to contain the
  mother and her young one, he put into a basket some linen
  rags and feathers, deposited it in the fame place where the
  vessel stood,     and conveyed the young parrot into it : the
  mother immediately repaired to the basket, and seemed highly
  satisfied with her new habitation ; but some hours after, she
  began to cut with her beak one edge of the basket: in three
  days she finished her work, having made an aperture in it
  four or five inches in width and six or seven in height.             The
  twigs were cut as neatly as if by the stiarpest instrument. —
   It appears to me that this fact can be explained only in two
   ways.      The mother, seeing her young one grow big, cut the
   edge of the basket, that when it was in a state to go abroad
   it might have no occasion to climb over the edge, which was
   about six inches in height.
   III.   Description of the Male, the Female, and young Parrot,
            in order to ascertain to what Species they belong.
       Had ornithologists left us exact descriptions, it would be
   easy   to compare different species : these descriptions are very
   often deficient and imperfect, and very often the male alone,
      *  Burton made the fame observation, vol. ix. 8vo. p. 1E7.

 or the female, has been delineated. It is well known that
there is a difference among birds according to their sex ; and
this has produced great ambiguity, of which many instances
might be produced : the cafe has been the fame, in my opi
nion, with the male in question.
  ¦ The male    is as large as a pullet of four months old : its
length from the root or the bill to the extremity of the tail
 is 14 inches.     The top of its head is of a beautiful yellow
 colour, which extends to the throat and the lower part of
 the neck. On the head, the feathers appear to have an orange
 tint, because there is a double row, the longest of which
 are yellow, and the shortest of a rose colour. The rest of the
 neck, the upper part of the back, and the cover of the wings,
 are of a brilliant green.     The breast, and belly are of a yel
 lowish green, and the tip of the wings of a beautiful yellow
 intermixed with orange. The plumes of the wings are varie
 gated with blue, violet, and very bright red.             The two exte
 rior feathers on each side of the tail have their internal barbs
 red at the origin of the quill, and of a dark green at the ex
 tremity, which is yellowish green : the other feathers are
 of 'a dark green, terminating with a yellowisli green. On the
 thighs it has very thick yellow feathers, like breeches a la
 Suijse: the bill is of an ash-gray colour, black at the tip:
the iris of the eye is orange : the feet are gray, and the claws
black.
    According to this description it appears that, by the head
 and tips of the wings, it may belong to the family of the
 criks ; but its size, and the plumage ot the back and belly,
seem to give it a resemblance         to the first species of the             yel
low-headed Amazon of Buffon.                The large yellow breeches
a la Suijse, as far as   I  know, have been described               by
                                                                     no or
nithologist;    and  this  peculiarity   is   sufficiently  remarkable    to
make   a  separate  class:   besides,   the  iris of  the eyes  of the par
rots in question    is orange instead of yellow, as           in the criks;
and the bill   is ash-coloured; while that of the Amazons                         is
red at the bottom, and that of the criks white.
    The female, which         smaller than the male,
                             is                               isas large as
a  pigeon:    her length   from   the    root    of  the  bill is only 11         [¦
inches.    The top of the head        is   yellow, and the tips of the
wings   pf a  bright red.     The plumage has             aperfect resem
blance to that os the yellow-headed Amazon of Buffon                     :   it   is
certainly the PJittacus major, viridis alarum, cojla fuperne

tacut nobilis of Linnæus *. In my opinion Linnæus alluded
to some species of Ara, as the individuals in question have not
their cheeks bare.      There can be no doubt that the female
is the real Amazon, but it is difficult to determine to what
species the male belongs.       It is possible that the latter may
be the male of this species, and that ornithologists may have
examined and described only the female, and may have sup
posed both to be perfectly similar ) which, however, is rarely
the cafe.    It cannot be classed either with the species ap
proaching the yellow-headed Amazon, and known under the
name of the bastard Amazon, or demi- Amazon ; for none of
these have yellow breeches on the thighs : to obtain, there
fore, a complete history of these birds, it would be necessary
to describe always both the male and the female.
   The young parrot, when examined at the third month,
had the head and lower part of the neck yellow, like the fa
ther : its length from the root of the bill was about 10 inches,
and, at four months, 1 1 inches. The body is exactly like
that of the father; but its plumage is of a much livelier and
tnore splendid green.      The tips of the wings are orange, the
small red feathers being interspersed with yellow : it has the
yellow breeches, but less tufted than those of the father ; the
lame legs, gray feet, and black claws : the bill is gray, and
blackish at the point. The eye till the third month was gray,
and the iris of the fame colour; but it gradually changed,
and at the fourth month it was yellow.                  I have no doubt
that it will become orange, like that of the father. Its tongue
is very black, and the nostrils well marked : the progress it
has made in size during the course of four months, induces
me to think that it will still grow, and become larger than
the father.
    This living individual may afford an opportunity of making
many important observations, which it would be interesting
to follow.

    I have requested the owner of this parrot to attend to the

 I believe it to be very long, it can be known only to the
second or third generation after us.           I have begged him also
 to note down to what age the mother will lay.                 At present

since she came into his possession ; and, as (he was then of
the full size, she must at least have been five years of age.     I
begged him likewise to be attentive during the next year,
and to observe whether one egg alone will produce, and whe
ther the rest will be equally fruitful.
,  IV.   Instances of some Parrots which have laid in Europe.
    The parrots both of the old and new continent never pass
the tropics, and seem con lined to a zone of 23 degrees on
each fide of the equator : in their wild state thev never pass
these limits, which nature seems to have prescribed to them.-
When transported beyond these latitudes, they live, and are
 sensible to love, notwithstanding the difference of climate.
We have some instances therefore, but very rare, of parrots
 producing young in our temperate countries ; though it often
 happens that they lay eggs without any germ. Buffon asserts,
 on the testimony of the Gazette de Litterature of the 17th of
November 1774, that M. de la Pigioniere had a male and a
 female parrot in the town of Marmande, in Angumois, which
 for five or fix years never failed to lay eggs that produced
young, which were reared by the father and the mother. These
 parrots were of the species called the jaco, or asti-coloured
 parrot of Guinea, Pjittacus cinereus feu fulcieruleus of Al-
drovandi.      He quotes father I„abat, who speaks of two par
 rots v\ hich several times produced voimg at Paris ; and the
abbess of Beaumont-lcs-Tours,        who had two young parrots
hatched in the month of January; but the cold soon killed
them.
    These are single facts which give us no information re
specting the habits of these birds either during the time ot
their laying or incubation.        We, however, no where find
that the Amazon parrots, or any others of America, ever
produced in Europe.
    Though the climate of Koine is not so cold as that of l'ari«,
as the mean temperature       at the end of March and the com
mencement of April is 17 degrees of Reaumur *, 1 am not ot
opinion that this was tRe principal cause ot these parrots pro
ducing ; as the fame thing must have often taken place in Sici
ly, Malta, and other countries lying more to the south: bm of
this we have no instance. I am therefore induced to think
that the parrots in question produced at Rome, because they
had been long together, were exceedingly fond of each other,
when they became acquainted, and always eiijoyed the com
pletest liberty ; because they were probably of the same age,

 find because the owner, finding that the eggs were not clear
 like those of the preceding year, but contained a germ,
 thought proper to leave them in a detached chamber exposed
 to the sun, gave the parrots more liberty and abundance
 of food.      I am fully persuaded that these causes contributed
 much more than the climate to their producing.
    If  instead of one young one, which I believe to be a male,
 there had been a female also, it is very probable that a breed
 might have been established at Rome.          We may hope for it
 the next year.
 Conjectures    respecting the Duration of the Life of Parrots,
    deduced    from the Time of tbeir Incubation, and compared
    with   that of other Birds.
    Salerne asserts that he saw a parrot 60 years of age still
 alive and active ; M. de la Borde fays that he saw one which
was more than 46 years, and I myself have seen one which
had been in the same family 75 years.
    Though Ollina, an excellent observer, was of opinion that
 the life of parrots, taken at a medium, did not exceed twenty
years, I am of opinion that he was deceived, having, per
haps, had an opportunity of observing only a small number
of individuals.
    All naturalists agree in assigning a long life to parrots, to
which Linnæus gives the epithet of longicvi.            This fact,
then, is incontestable.      The parrots in question furnish a new
proof of it. According to the calculation already made, the
age of the female cannot be less than 20 years; for, as it is
five since (he first laid, it thence results that she was then 15;
but if in the order of nature these birds begin to lay at that
age, this would be another proof of their longevity, since we
know that the large birds, with which we are best acquainted,
are capable of laying before they arc a year old, and that they
live at least nine or ten times as long: we may thence con
clude that these parrots mult live 130 or 150 years.        It may
be objected, indeed, that it sometimes happens that the fe
males do not become mothers till an age greater than that
established by nature : but this is rarelv the cafe among
quadrupeds, and still less so among birds. The parrots in
question     lived together ten years without laying, though
they enjoyed the Tame liberty and the fame facility of copu
lating as they afterwards had; and therefore we may suppose
that nature was not disposed for it.
    Bufl'on thinks that the life of birds is longer in proportion
than that of quadrupeds, according to the time emplpyed in
their growth.       As we can obtain certain data respecting the

time employed for the whole growth only in regard to a small
number of individuals, let us try whether we cannot, by in
duction, discover that the longevity of birds is proportioned
to the duration of their incubation.
    I subjoin the following table in order that the reader may
see, at one view, the period of the incubation of different
birds, and the duration of their life in the next column.                  I
must however observe that the time of incubation ia not al
together the same in all climates : in warm climates it is acce
lerated, and in cold climates retarded.              But the differenco
is very small, and can occasion no sensible difference in the
table.

     We shall here observe, that it appears by this table that
 the swan and parrot, which employ the longest time in in
 cubation, are not those which live longest : tine longevity of
 the former of these birds has been carried to aoo years, and
 that of the latter to 100.
     In regard to the ostrich, the life of which the antienu
 carried beyond too years, we can find no relation between
 this period and that of the incubation, as the female seldom

the antients assigned a life equally long; but we have no ob
servations in regard to their incubation *..
    The goose, which employs thirty days in incubation, lives
beyond the age of 80. The eagle, bustard, turkey, and duck,
are the next in the table in regard to the period of incuba
tion ; but it has never yet been compared by any one with
the duration of their life.
   All the other birds mentioned in the table, live nearly in
proportion to the time of their incubation ; but, as these
observations were made chiefly on domestic or captive birds,
it is probable that there may be some difference between these
and those which are in the wild state.
    " We know besides," fays M. de Buffon, " that we never
give time to our domestic birds to go through the complete
period of Jife assigned to them by nature."
    In regard to birds in their wild state, it is almost impossible
to obtain any correct information.             Very few ornithologists,
therefore, have spoken of the duration of their life ; and when
they are caught in snares, they endeavour to judge of their
age by marks which are very ambiguous. (See Arijlotle.)
   The constant ratio which I have observed between the
time of incubation and the duration of the life of birds, fug-
         to me the idea of examining what relation there is
  etween the duration of the life of quadrupeds and the time
fested
employed in gestation ; and I have made out the following

and that   of the incubation of birds, in regard to the duration
of life.   Thus we observe that, among quadrupeds, the ele
phant, which lives from 150 to 200 years, goes with young
24 months; and that the camel, which goes with young
12 months, lives 40 or 50 years.         Among birds, the swan,
¦which sits 42 days, and the parrot, which fits 40 days, are
those which live longest, their life exceeding 100 years.        In
looking   over  this table,  the  fame relation  appears to be pre
served.    The   horse and ass,  which   have   the fame period  of
gestation, live nearly the fame time; that is to fay, 26 or
30 years.    The domestic fowl and pigeon, which have nearly
the fame period of incubation, attain to the fame age ; and
the cafe is the fame with the goal and the sheep, as well as
with the canary-bird and the linnet.
   I must, however, confess, that in these tables there are two
very striking exceptions.      The stag, among quadrupeds, goes
with young a month less than the mare, and yet lives about
ten years longer : and, among the birds, I observe that the
crow, which fits only twenty days, lives far beyond too years,
according to Hesiod and several other observers.
   These exceptions still further prove that our knowledge re
specting this part of natural history i- very limited, and prove
the necessity of making more observations.         Besides, the dif
ficulty of ascertaining the exact duration of the life of qua
drupeds is equally great as that experienced in ascertaining
the duration of the life of birds, since these observations can
be made only on a small number of individuals, taken, for
the most part, in a state 'of domesticity; and M. de Buffon
sagely remarks, that man, wishing for continual enjoyment,
shortens the period.
   If, notwithstanding these exceptions, some relation has
been supposed to be found between the time employed for
perfect growth, and the duration of life, it appears, from a
view of this table, that there is a more direct connection be
tween it and the time of gestation : nature also seems to have
preserved a kind of connection between the time employed in
gestation and that of incubation in regard to the duration of
the life of birds and quadrupeds.
   The period of the incubation of the parrot, which no na
turalist had before observed, has led me into considerations
somewhat prolix; but ideas suggested merely as hints, when
aided by experience and more correct observation, often con
duct to important truths.

XLT. Description and Natural History of the Wild Goat
 of the Alps. By M. Berthout Van Bkrchem jun.
                      [Concluded      from   p.   hi.]
B,UT        having said enough in regard to this animal in its
confined state, let us now hasten to restore it to liberty : it is
on the summits of the steepest rocks, suspended, as we may
fay, between the heavens and the earth, that it ought to be
considered,    as it is there that it displays all its strength and
agility.    It is particularly interesting to fee the ease and fa
cility with which it traverses the most awful rocks, the bare
sight of which inspires terror, and which are inaccessible to
man.      When it leaps, it docs not seem to take a spring; it
directs its fight with the greatest precision to the place it
wisties to reach, and never mifl'cs its aim.        When tranquil,
it generally carries its" head low; but when running, it holds
it elevated : it even throws it somewhat back, which heightens
the agreeableness of its figure. When it wishes to raise itself
to the top of a perpendicular rock fifteen feet in height, it
does it at three leaps, or rather three successive jumps, of five
feet each : one might fay that it scarcely found any point of
support on the rock; and it appears to have touched it only
that it might be thrown higher, with the fame force that an
elastic ball would be if impinged against, a hard body.              It
never makes more than three leaps in this manner.             If it be
between two rocks standing near each other, and wishes to
get to the top, it accomplishes its object by jumping from
the one to the other.       It traverses the glaciers also with great
rapidity, but only when chaced : when its course is volun
tary it avoids them, and docs not seem to walk on them with
such confidence as among the rocks.
    I shall now give an account of the manner in which the
wild goat lives when peaceably suffered to follow its natural
habits, wlien not molested in its retreats; and shall then de
scribe the manner in -which it is hunted.          We shall see in
what manner man, who of all beings is the most destructive,
penetrates into the almost inaccessible places which nature has
assigned to this animal, and where, as appears, it ought to
be sheltered front his rapacity.        We fliall fee how, at the
risk of his life, and braving the molt imminent dangers, he
pursues  it,  and has diminiflied the number in such         a man
ner, that, though   it  was formerly dispersed over all the high
mountains of Swisserland, Savoy, and the Valais,           it    now
                                                                is
found only in some places, and even               in
                                               small numbers.
                                  Q   4                          These

     348                    .'   On the   Wild Goat of the Alpt.
       .-These goats feed during the night in the highest woods,
     'and never further than a quarter of a league from the fum-
.   . mit; but, when the fun begins to illuminate the tops of the
*     mountains, they leave the woody regions in flocks, ascend
      the mountains as they feed, and proceed sometimes to very
      considerable heights. They seek the declivities turned to
      wards the east and south, and lie down in the highest and
      most elevated places.   But when the fun has got through
      three-fourths of his course they descend to the woods, feed
      ing as they proceed, in order to pass the night. When it
      threatens to snow, they descend also into the woods for the
     fake   of   shelter.
         These animals assemble in flocks of to, 12, or 15; for
     merly they were more numerous, but at present they are
     often in small numbers.         All the males si* years of age, and
     those above       it,
                        always remain in higher places than the              fe
     males or the males that are younger. The older they are,
     they are the less fond of living in society.           They become
     hardened against the cold, frost, and all the severity of the
     seasons.     Very often these old goats have the tips of their
     ears withered, and, as         were, dead.
                                          it        Severe cold must ne
     cessarily produce this effect on extremities where            itwell
                                                                        is
     known the circulation of the blood            easily checked.

     lead   a solitary life on the steep summits, and never descend
     from them.       To conclude what we have to say in regard to.
     their habits, we shall here observe, that in winter they are
     accustomed to place themselves on eminences opposite to that
     part of the horizon from which the storm proceeds, and to
     remain there like statues: they only go from time to time
     to feed in the neighbourhood, and then return to their sta
     tion.    The females and young have not this habit they re    ;
     main at all seasons             in
                                places less elevated.
         As the fore-legs of these animals are shorter than those
     behind,      it   natural to suppose that they can ascend with,
                       is
      more facility than they descend.          Nothing but the severity
      of the weather can induce them to remain in the low                    di
      stricts;  and,    if   few sine days take place in winter, they
                                 a
      immediately     quit  the woods and ascend the mountains.
          Winter is their season of love, and the month of January
      that of their greatest heat.     All the goats, of whatever age,
      then mix together; the males combat, and the females be
      long to the victors; after which they return to their usual
      order. The females go with young five months, and bring
      forth in the last week of June or first of July. They produce
      only one at      time, of the size of cat, and which, like the
                       a                            a
      young chamois, walks as soon as dropped. An hour after
                                                                             its

mix in their natural (late.
    The best time for hunting the wild goats is towards the
end of summer* and in autumn, in the month of August and
September. It is then that they are in best condition.                 This
species of hunting is exceedingly dangerous and fatiguing,
and therefore can be undertaken only dv the inhabitants of
the mountains. The hunters, besides resolution to look down
without fear from the greatest heights, must have sufficient
address and steadiness of foot to get out of difficult passes, and
Jo take accurate aim. They must also be endowed with great
strength and vigour to endure hunger, cold, and the greatest
fatigue. The most determined hunters reside in the moun
tains of the Lower Valais : almost all the peasants of Servan               f
                                                                     follow
   * A hunter    one day surprised a female chamois while bringing forth
her young one on a rock : a sentiment placed by nature in the breast of all
mankind retained his arm, and prevented him from killing her : he viewed
(his interesting spectacle for some moments, and saw the mother lick her
kid. He then prepared to fire, but the chamois and her young one both
instantly disappeared, and concealed themselves among the rocks.
    t The village of Servan is situated in the mountains of the Lower Va
lais, and at the distance of two or three leagues from Martigni : its situa
tion is the wildest and most picturesque    I ever saw. It stands on the de
clivity of a chain of mountains which borders on the west that part of the
valley of Trient, which is only a continuation of that of Orsine, in Upper
Faucigny.      At the bottom of this valley runs the water of Berard with a
roaring noise, and, uniting itself to the Trient, assumes its name.     Tor
rents, which dalh down on every side from the summits of the mountains
in superb cascades, contribute ro enlarge its stream. That silence of nature,
that calmness, at the fame time awful and delightful, which is experienced
in the middle of a forest during a fine summer's night, never prevails in
this abode. The air is continually agitated by the noise of the torrent
which flows through the middle of the valley, and by that of the nume
 rous cascades which join it; But this continual and hollow roaring of the
water is often increased by the tumbling down of large masses, and the fall
                                                                           of

happens  that, not being able to disengage themselves from
the rocks, they are obliged to pass the night standing in
of the rocks, which, attacked by the flow action of the     moist elements, crum
 ble to pieces through age, and choke up the bottom of the valley. These
 torrents, by tearing open the sides of the mountains, unveil to us their in
terior structure.     J n this country, every thing presents the image of de
 struction : it is in the middle of these degraded forests of firs and pines, of
 those accumulated rocks which pass through all the states of decomposition
to sand, and from the state of sand to that of mould, that the geologue dis
covers the composition of mountains, and collects facts for the theory of
 the earth.    But in the midst of this disorder one may discover the hand of
man and the labour of industry : excited by his. wants; sheltered from all
 quarters by the rocks, and in a good exposure, the inhabitants have col
lected a little earth, which they cultivate and sow with corn to supply
th;m with food.
    Of all the cascades with which this valley is decorated, the most inte
 resting for the naturalist and the painter is that, no doubt, of Maupas, be
tween the village of Finio and that of Scrvan. The torrent of the Trieve,
the white foaming waters of which dashing against the rocks, which they
 break and carry with them to their bed, form several cascades; between
very high rocks, a plank laid across serves as a passage, and from this tre
mendous bridge the torrent is seen precipitating itself from one fall to an
other, and flying to a distance below the feet : before is a rock cut into the
form of a peak, and which seems to be an insurmountable barrier; but ;»
small narrow path, cut out in a zig-zag form and furnished with a parapet,
enables, the traveller to pass over  it,   and to consider this sublime and mag
nificent view, which the horrid noise of the torrent renders still more
striking.    The more you advance towards Scrvan, the less steep the de
clivity of the mountain hecomes, while the valley becomes broader and
better cultivated.      Butin   traversing this wild country oneis   not astonished
that the inhabitants should seek for and be fond of those dangers to which
they expose themselves    in   hunting the chamois and wild goats: they aic
bred up to this occupation  ;     the rocks and precipices arc, as we may fay,
their element, and when they quit their habitations they find no perils to
which they are not accustomed.

situations which none can have an idea of but those who have
traversed the rocks.        I cannot here help making one reflec
tion : It is among the inhabitants of theft wild and horrid
mountains that.l found the greatest honesty and friendship;
 in a word, all those virtues which render men worthy of
esteem.
     As these animals ascend to the highest regions early in
the morning, the hunters must get to those places before
them. The goats are then seen coming to pasture, and,
though their smell is exceedingly acute, they do not smell
 the hunters, who, concealing themselves behind the rocks,
suffer them to approach within 30 or 40 paces before they
fire.
     The following appear to be the most natural causes why
these animals do not smell the hunters : — In the morning the
fun heats and rarefies the upper regions of the air, while the
lower ones are still cold ana condensed.                From this want of
equilibrium there must necessarily result a current which pro
 ceeds upwards, and which consequently carries in that direc
 tion the emanations proceeding from the hunter, who is
 above the goats.       This effect, indeed, must take place during
 the greater part of the day ; for the fun, by warming the de
 clivities of the mountains, must produce along them an
 ascending current.        Besides, as these animals feedas they go
along, their nostrils become filled with dew, which must
 have a very great influence on their smell.                However, it is
 essentially necessary to get to the heights before the goats
 reach them ; if they anticipate the hunter, they smell him,
 and make their escape : it would in that case be of no use to
 follow them ; for, when once put to flight, they never stop
 till they get to a very great distance, and when they think
 they are beyond all danger*.            It is singular that the animal
 never flies till it smells the hunter;          for if it only  fees  him it
    5>Tiie reader will not be displeased to see here an account of the manner
 in which the inhabitants of the island of Crtte hunt the wild goat, as de
 scribed by Belon : — Some of the peasants who live on the summits of the
 high mountains are such dexterous (hooters with the bow, and principally
 around the mountain of Spachia and Madara, that they pierce them with
 their arrows at the distance of 15 paces; and, to be more sure of them,
 csrry females, which they have bred up and tamed from their youth, and
tie them up in some passage of the mountains where the males are accus
 tomed to pass.   The hunter conceals himself behind the bushes opposite
 to the wind, knowing that the male goats have so acute smell, that they
 could smell them at the distance of 100 paces.      The male finding the fe
 male in his way stops, and the peasant then discharges his arrow. — Ob/erv.

                                                                           is

as it smells the blood it betakes itself to flight ; then returns,
approaches with the fame eagerness, and again retires for the
fame reason.    It can hardly be consoled for the loss of its
mother ; searches for her a long time, and never quits the
place where it was brought forth and where it lost her.
   When a wild goat is wounded, all the rest make their
escape and abandon it : they are seized with fear and terror,
and  fly with the utmost rapidity. The hunter can distinguish
the wild goats that have been wounded, by their walk, which
is flow.    They suffer their heads to fall sometimes to the one
fide and sometimes to the other, and they soon after he down,
even when the wound       isslight.
   Man, though the greatest enemy and principal destroyer
of these wild goats,      is,
                            however, not the only one whom
they have to dread.       The wolves and eagles pursue their
young*. The mothers, on these occasions, escape with them
to caverns or hollow places in the rocks, make their young
enter first, and then, having entered themselves, present their
head to the aperture in order to face the enemy.
   There are few animals the natural history of which         disis
figured with more fables        by
                                superstition, and more errors          by
ignorance, than that of the wild goat. The naturalist, as
already observed,    isobliged to trust to the hunters, and these
indemnify themselves for the labour and fatigue they have
experienced     bythe falsehoods which they propagate: be
sides, an animal the hunting of which         is   so
                                                  painful, ought,
in the eyes of the vulgar, to have something of the marvel
lous connected with it. Hence the property ascribed to the
horns of the wild goat of destroying the force of poison      and;
hence the opinion of the hunters, that            their pieces are
                                                   if

expert, and so sure of its aim, that it has never any occasion*
to throw itself on its horns : that if this ever happens, it is
by accident ; and besides, it is sufficient to look at the animal
to be convinced that it could not take such leans with im
punity.     It has a long body^ its legs are short, its limbs are
thick, and it weighs nearly 200 pounds : how, then, is it
           that it should throw itself from the rocks without
   eing torn by their sharp points, or dashed to pieces by its
Eoffible
fall ? I have been more particular in regard to this fact, be
 cause the same error is not only related by most naturalists^
 but is received also among the Tartars *, who are hunters
Of wild goats, like the people of the Valais of Swisserland ;
 and because this conformity of opinion among people so di
 stant might induce some to believe in the reality of the fact.
 But is it not well known that the fame prejudices are found
 among different nations ? Ignorance is every where the fame,
 and every where the fame objects have given rife to the like
 errors. Those naturalists whb are so fond of final causes,
 wishing to give utility to the large horns of the wild goat,
 have adopted this opinion } and it is thus that the mania of
 wistiing to explain every thing injures the cause of truth, and
 often perpetuates popular tales. M. Pallas, deceived by the
  accounts of the Tartars, mentions, a3 a proof of this asser
  tion, a wild goat which he saw having one of its horns
  broken  f:   but this, in all probability, was owing to another
  cause. Their large, thick, and almost useless horns are often
  broken by the tumbling down of the rocks 5 and on these
  occasions they are often killed themselves.             For this reason,
  the inhabitants of Cormajor traverse the bottoms of the
  mountains to collect the horns carried down by the snow.
  M. Pallas fays, also, that the wild goat is of so savage a na

wild goats, he is right ; but the instances above mentioned
prove that, if the wild goat be caught young, it is susceptible
of education : and this Opinion is confirmed l>y that of Bclon,
who fays, that in the ifland of Crete this animal is tamed
when young.
    When one of these animals has been killed, it is left on
the spot till it becomes cold. The entrails are then taken
out, and the blood is put into the stomach.              In consequence
of this method it never acquires a bad smell, which takes
place when this precaution is neglected.              Large wild goats,
without the entrails, weigh 180 or 200 pounds, of 18 ounces.
The female from 70 to 80 and 90 pounds. The flesh of this
animal is excellent j it has the taste of mutton, but is more
succulent.
    The skin can be dressed exceedingly well : it becomes very
pliable, and resembles that of the goat.             It is employed for
manufacturing shamoy leather. Various small articles are
made of the horns, such as cups and goblets.                The blood is
employed in false pleurisies ; but, as its properties are owing
to the plants on which the animal feeds, that of the common
goat and ram, when fed in the fame manner, has the fame
efficacy   *.
    The   sale  of these goats is liable to many variations : it de
pends on the weight of the beast, and the eagerness of the
purchaser. Formerly they were cheaper, because more com
mon.      At present they are sold sometimes for four louis-
d'ors.     The chamois also is fold for one louis-d'or.                 The
wild goat is fond of salt: it licks the rocks which contain
Epsom or Glauber's salt, and the waters which hold it in so
lution.      It feeds chiefly on the wild plants that grow on the
higher Alps, such as silky wormwood, artemisia glacialis ;
but in winter it eats the lichens and young shoots of the
trees.     Like that of Siberia f, it prefers those places which
abound with the dwarf birch, the Alpine willow, the tbi-
liflrum, sassafras, rose-wort, rbodiola, the willow-herb, epi-
lob'ium,    &c.
    These animals are much scarcer than they were formerly ;
they are found at present only in some mountains of Savoy
anu the ValaiSj whereas formerly they were dispersed through
out all the higher parts of Swislerland %. But this is not

of Cogne, which is the frontier of the valley of Font, in Pied
mont, that it is now most common, and always on the de
clivities exposed to the south.
    It is no longer found in the Valteline, the frontier of the
Valaisj but it must stili exist in the mountains between the
valley of Sefia and that of Vieche. - It was hunted, about
30 or 40 years ago, in the mountains of Upper Faucigny :
out the breed is now entirely destroyed in that quarter; and
it is probable, if the hunters continue to pursue it with the
same ardour, that the race will become totally extinct.
    In reflecting on the fury with which these animals are pur
sued and destroyed, the cause           of it appears to me to have been
the great abundance which there was of them formerly ; and,
though a single goat did not produce much, as a great many
were killed during one hunting excursion, the gain was con
siderable.      At present, since the number_ has greatly de
creased, and since the hunters often go a great way without
finding any, their ardour ought to be relaxed in consequence of
the dangers to which they are exposed : and besides, trie inhu
manity of persecuting and tormenting a mild and timid ani
mal, which has po other resources to defend itself but flight and
server, has furnished me with the following notice: — " There were for
merly wild goats in our Alps, but none of them are now to be found.            I
have   seen at Unterseveh    two superb horns  of that animal, which is said to
have been killed formerly in the Alps of Lauterbninn.            These animals
were destroyed by the      hunters, as well as the castors, which formerly fre
quented the borders of lake Brientz, and along the Arr towards Thun.
] am certain M. Bourrit is mistaken when he fays that he saw one traverse
the chain of mountains that separates Lauterbninn and GrindcIvJd, since
none of the hunters of that country ever fell in with any during thtir ex
cursions.    It is asserted that wild goats are still found, but rarely, in the
wildest mountains of the country of the Grifons : for my part,          I rever
saw any in my travels; and none of the hunters were able to give me any
certain information respecting them." — Letter of M. IVittenbacb to M. Fjn

address, a motive, indeed, of little importance to a being who
thinks himself the sovereign of animals, but who is only their
tyrant, and knows no other laws than those of the strongest,
the hunters ought to consider, before they leave their wives
and families, that they not Only expose themselves to be
killed, or maimed during the remainder of their lives *, but
neglect their property ana affairs, and, if they perish, their
families are reduced to beggary.              If
                                        these considerations are
not sufficiently strong to deter them from this kind of hunt
ing, let them reflect, that they can entertain no hope of
making their fortunes ; since no one acquires riches by this
occupation, but, on the contrary, they are often lamed, and
drag out their existence in misery.    But such is the force of
habit and the power of illusion, that the accidents which
happen to the hunters do not deter them ; for they are
scarcely cured when they return to the fame occupation f.

    • The elegalit translator of Coxe expresses himself in the following
manner in regard to hunting the chamois : — " A great number of men
lose their lives by this kind of hunting : the thick fogs of the Alps, which
suddenly envelop the country with a dark veil, make the hunters wander
into the glaciers, where they perish with cold and hunger. Sudden storms
moisten the rocks, and render them so slippery, that the hunter, however
furnished with cramps his shoes may be, cannot attach himself to them ;
and sometimes the heat has so dried their scorching faces, and covered them
with dust of 1b moveable a nature, that the wretched hunter who clambers
up them is obliged to moisten them with his blood, by making large
Wounds in the soles of his sect and his legs." Coxes Letters on Siuijfer-
land, p. Z73. M. Ramond, the translator, adds, that the abbe d'Engeiberg
congratulated himself that he had lost only five men in one year by hunt
ing the chamois ; and his district     is, at most, but  a hundredth pare of the
Swiss Alps.
f     One of my friends traversing the mountains one day with          a   guide,
the latter showed him    a  spot where the year before he had remained more
than six hours with his thigh broken, and without any hopes of relief.
A young shepherd,     by  the greatest accident, heard the reports of his fusee,
which he fired as    a   signal of distress, and at last went to call assistance.
This accident happened to him while hunting the chamois, and yet did       it
not disgust him with the occupation.
  %   The wild goat of Siberia    is  no longer found    in the Urallan Alps and
the civilized countries of Siberia :   it inhabits the steepest mountains of that
chain, which unites with the Taurus between Eastern Tartary and Sibe
ria.   It   isfound also in Eastern Siberia beyond the Lena, and in the
countries of Kamschatka.     It is   believed likewise that   itfrequents the de
sert forests bordering on the middle country of the Tongusians, to the east
ot the Jenissee and beyond the Lena; nut these animals are every where

a few flight characters, which, however, are not sufficient to
make them two distinct species.      The former has always a
very large beard j while that of the latter is very short, and
sometimes it has none.     The hair of the Siberian wild goat
seems, in general, to be longer and thicker than that of the
Alpine wild goat; but the most striking difference, though
not very specific, is that found in the horns. The anterior
face of the horns of the Siberian wild goat is not so flat, it
is more convex ; and is not comprehended between two lon
gitudinal ridges, as in the wild goat in question : the trans
versal knotes are not terminated by a salient tubercle on the
internal border of the face.    In other respects, these horns
have a perfect resemblance.
    The Cretan wild goat, according to Belon, is certainly of
the fame species as the Alpine wild goat : but it appears that
there are two kinds of           it,
                              one of them perhaps the cegagrus*.

    M. Perroud has given very good account of the manners
                                      a
of this animal, which has been inserted in Bufson's Natural
History  t:   we shall add to          few observations.
                                          it   a            We are
assurea that in the mountains there are two species of the
chamois      one, which
             :               much smaller than the other, keeps
                                 is
in the higher districts, and ascends to the fame elevations as
the wild goat. The large species, on the other hand, frequent
the less elevated regions, and live chiefly in the woods.
These two species, however, ase only two varieties, or rather
two constant races, which can mix and produce. The large
chamois have two holes behind their horns, which are not
found in the smaller kind.       These holes penetrate to the or
gans of the head. The males of this large species weigh from
Ho to ioo pounds, and the females from 60 to 70; whereas
the males of the lesser species weigh only 6a or 70 pounds,
these  names are corrupted from those which the Moguls and the Cal-
eioucs give equally to the wild goat and the domestic goat.      The latter
call the male taiga, the female )<ima, and the kid rjli^a or idjhija.   The
Chinese also call the male wild yoats takjti; and thev employ their horns,

fond of being alone, and in small Hocks.                      Their limbs and!
body are shorter,         and   consequently     thicker   in  proportion than
the    small    kind, which are longer        and    slenderer.
    The males can produce at the age of two years. The rut
ting time is in November and December, and they bring:
forth their young in June. The large chamois bring forth
sometimes in Mav.               They generally produce one at a time*
and rarely two. These animals arc hunted in the fame man
ner as the wild goats, except that dogs are sometimes em
ployed. They are always in fear ; have their eyes and ears
on the watch.            They never feed in tranquillity.           They crop
a little grafs, then raise their heads ; and while they eat, look
on all fides around them : if one of them perceives anv thing,
the whole stock take to flight ; whereas a stock of wild goats
all whistle before they fct oft".                 In regard to the sentinel
which, it is said, they post to give them notice of danger,
it appears to be a mete fable, founded on the timidity of
these animals. Both races of the chamois exist in the moun
tains of the country of Hasli, of Grindewald and Lauterbrun,
as well as in those of Savoy and the Valais.                     It might here
be proper to examine, with Messrs. BiVffon and Pallas, to
what wild animal the goats are indebted for their origin j
whether to the wild goat of the Alps, as Busson thinks, or
to the capra otgagrus, according to Pallas ; and whether the
chamois and Alpine wild goat are the fame, or two distinct
species.        These interesting questions would require to be exa
mined at full length *, but in the mean time I fball mention
my own opinion.              I have endeavoured to examine those of
Busson and Pallas with that impartiality which every one wh»
sincerely searches for truth ought to. employ, and especially
when he discusses the opinions of men lo justly celebrated.
 I agree therefore with Busson, that the Alpine wild goat ought
 to be considered as the origin of all the goats.                     The con
 formity of their manners and figure, and the circumstance of
 these breeds intermixing and producing, are sufficient proofs
 of it. In my opinion, the copra agagrus and the Capricorn
 are varieties in the species of the wild goat, and have con
 curred with it to form the different races of our goats.                  But,
 I think, with M. Pallas, thai the chamois cannot he of the
 fame species as the wild goat, since they do not mix in a
 ft. te ot nature, and I consider           it as an intermediate species
 between the goats and the antelopes.
     '  I discusst-d this question in the natur.1l history of the jackal], which
 sweated in the Journal       t.e Ptyfque for November 17*1*.
                                                                    XLII.    On

were first made known by myself in a paper on the longi
tudinal vibrations of rods and strings, published at Erfurt in
1796, and which may be found also in the Transactions of
the Electoral Academy of Sciences of that city.                  For some
time I have observed, that, besides these two directions of
vibrating motion, there is a third, where the rod, or each
part into which it divides itself, turns alternately to the right
and left in a spiral form, while the vibration nodes or the
boundaries of the vibrating parts remain motionless, as in
the other kinds of vibration.           Such spiral vibrations may be
produced with most ease on a sufficiently long cylindric rod,
the surface of which has been made as smooth as possible, if
the rod be held gently between two fingers at the place where
there is a vibration node, and if it be rubbed in a spiral di
rection in a vibrating part with a piece of woollen rag held
between the fingers of the other hand.              When the rod is of
wood or metal, the rag must be previously strewed over with
resin; but when a glass rod, or, what is the fame thing, a
thermometer or barometer tube is employed, it must be
moistened with water, or be strewed over with very sine sand.
The ways in which a rod, when it is either entirely free, or
fastened at one end and free at the other, or fastened at both
ends, can divide itself into vibrating parts, and the position
of the vibration nodes, are entirely the fame as in the cafe of
longitudinal vibrations. The sharpness and flatness of the tone
depend also on the same laws; and therefore, to avoid all un
necessary prolixity, I shall refer to the above-mentioned essay
  • From Der

i6d                Observations on Maddering,
 on longitudinal vibrations. There i§ this difference, however,
 that, as far as I have observed, the tone, when the vibrations
 take place in a spiral direction, is a fifth lower than when the
rod vibrates in a longitudinal direction under the fame cir
cumstances.
    By the spiral vibration one phænomenon, which            haveI
mentioned in my discoveries respecting the theory of sound,
but respecting which I formed an erroneous opinion, can be
explained. On a prismatic rod,' one end of which was fastened
in a vice, when I rubbed one of its edges, in a diagonal di
rection, with a violin bow, and strewecT sand over one of its
horizontal fides, there appeared on this side a line proceeding
along its length, where the sand, which was thrown from the
other parts by the vibration, remained at rest ; and this ap
pearance took place on each fide of the rod when held hori
zontally.     The reason of this     is,
                                      because at the edges which
are further distant from the axis the range during the vibra

part of powdered alum in two parts of boiling water; and while
this solution of sulphate of alumine was still warm, to avoid
re-crystallization,I    speedily poured into  it successively, always
stirring it  without interruption, the above-mentioned caustic
ley, till the alumine  it  had at first precipitated after saturation
to excess with sulphuric acid had been redissolved.          I  left at
rest this solution of alumine, which exhaled ammonia, and
which, on cooling, formed        a precipitate of sulphate of potash
in very small crystals.     I   then mixed   a   thirty-third part of

   formed a kind of milky liquid *. As the oil gradually sepa
   rates itself from this mixture under the appearance of cream,
  it must not be employed till it is again shaken. The flcains
  of cotton or linen ought to be successively immersed in                                    it,
  and equally pressed, that they may be then exposed to dry on
      pole in the order in which they have been taken from the
a

  summer, and in         warm place in winter, and be left

 the property of mixing with the oil.

with linseed-oil will be sufficient to obtain beautiful red               a                  ;

    The best method of obtaining shades lively as well as
bright, is to expose the dark reds for a considerable time,
when they have been cleared, to the action of a                  of oxy       ley
genated muriate of potalh, or of soda with excess of alkaline
carbonate, in order to have such            degree of shade as may be

would be expensive.
    To have the oily alkaline solution of alum nearly                 the             in

    All fat oils may be employed in the mixture with proper
precautions ; but linseed-oil mixes better, and remains longer
suspended in the alkaline solution of alumine:       I never tried
fish-oil,  which, perhaps,  would  be  preferable.  It is probable
also, that in operating on a large scale, it would be best to
diminish the quantity of linseed-oil in the mixtures with the
alkaline solution of alumine ; for I have had reason often to
observe that too much oil hurts the attraction of the colour
ing parts of the madder: a thirty-third part of linseed-oil
always produced the best effect in my trials on a small
scale.
    In regard to the process  of dyeing cotton and linen thread,
sufficiently charged   with alumine,    by the oily alkaline solu
tion of that earth, the skains must first be disengaged from
every saline substance, as well as from the superfluous oil, by
rinsing them a long time in very pure running water; after
which they must be arranged, without drying them, on an
apparatus, which the operator may construct according to
the form of the boiler, — in which it is lo be placed in such a
manner, that during the process of dyeing the skains may
be continually shaken and turned, in order to catch every
where, and in an uniform manner, the colouring particles.
The bath must be composed of madder, mixed with a sixth
of pounded chalk, and diluted with about 30 or 40 parts of
 water. The heat must be carried only to such a degree that
 the hand can be held in thte bath for an hour without being
 scalded ; and it is to be maintained at this degree for two
 hours, either by diminishing or increasing the fuel. Three
 hours dyeing will be lufficient to exhaust the madder : the
 skains when taken from the bath must be washed in a large
 quantity of water to cleanse them ; they are then to be cleared
 by boiling them a pretty long time in water containing bran
 inclosed in a bag, adding soap and alkaline carbonate to give
 the red a rosy or carmine (hade.
    As I never had occasion to dye cotton or linen thread on a
 large scale, I employed a small boiler, which served me at the
 same time for the process of clearing : in the latter operation
 I confined myself to boiling the skains, properly arranged, in
 water containing a bag tilled with bran, for eight hours suc
 cessively ; and, that 1 might not interrupt the ebullition, I
 replaced the evaporated part by the addition of more boiling
 water.    In this clearing I employed neither soap nor alkali ;
 yet I obtained a red superior in beauty and fixity to that of
 the Levant, and which, in every respect, will bear a com
 parison with the belt colours dyed in France.

 264                Observations   on  Madderlng,
    For dyeing my red, I employed three parts of the best-
 madder for one part in weight of dry cotton thread.
    With the precaution I took to obtain an uniform (hade           I
 could have dyed at one time, but I mould always recom
 mend performing this operation at two different times, taking
 each time half a portion of madder and of chalk, if the fkains
 cannot be continually turned in the boiler: it may serve also
 for clearing, by adapting to it a cover so as to suffer very little
 of the vapours to escape, because it would be too expensive to
 replace the part evaporated by more boiling water.          By ope
 rating on a large scale, and concentrating the heat in the
 boilers, keeping them almost close, there, perhaps, would be
 no need of employing eight hours ebullition to clear and fix
 the colours. I have every reason to believe that this clearing
 of the Turkey red gave rife to the idea of bleaching with
 steam : it must have Deeu seen that colours by being cleared
 lose considerably in regard to their intensity ; and perhaps it
 has been observed at the same time that the packthreads em
 ployed for arranging the fkains were bleached during the
 clearing, especially when alkalies were added.
    A great variety of colours and of different shades may be
 obtained by following the process here described for obtain
 ing beautiful and durable reds. In this cafe, the oily alkaline
solution of alumine must not be employed till the required
 {hade of oxide of iron or indigo blue has been given ; but
whatever may be the colour or shade which you wish to give,
hefore you fix the alumine on the fkains of cotton or linen*
these fkains must always be first well boiled, by which means
the adhesion of ihe indigo fecula as well as that of the oxide of
iron will be increased in the same manner as that of alumine.
coloured by the colouring parts of madder when subjected to
the action of the heat of boijinoc water before they are im
pregnated with the oily alkaline solution ot alumine.         As the
method of dyeing indigo blue in all its sliades is well known,
it is needless to detail it ; and as to giving a rusty yellow colour,
which may be done at little expense, nothing is necessary but
to moisten the fkains well with a solution of the sulphate of
iron, to press them equally, and then to immerse them in a
caustic ley of potash, which will precipitate and fix the oxide
of iron of a disagreeable colour, but which will not fail to
assume a rusty yellow (hade by attracting and becoming satu
rated with the oxvgen of the atmosphere : thus yellow will be
more or less dark according to the quantity of the sulphate of
irojf in solution. "More intensity and even more equality
may be given to the rusty yellow by moistening the fkains a
                                                              second.

of   the colouring parts* of all these ingredients varies also to
such a degree, that the (hades arising from a yellow or olive-
green will be changed or totally metamorphosed by a second
dyeing with madder, kermes, cochineal, or Brazil wood ; and
will furnish orange (hades, capucine, carmelite, burnt bread,
bronze, &c. As the preliminary preparation of the {kains by
the oily alkaline solution of alumine might be too expensive
for some of these colours, the process I described in the
Annales de Chimie for the year 1792, p. 250, may be sub
stituted in its stead.   This process consists in treating the
(kains alternately with soap and sulphate of alumine, the
excess of the acid of which has been saturated with one of
the alkaline carbonates or with lime: this method is very
expeditious.     In the course of a day, especially in summer,
the (kains may be prepared and dyed red as well as other
colours ; which, for the most part, may be subjected to ebul
lition, and will bear clearing with oran for a quarter or
half hour, and even some os them for a whole hour. It is
also to be observed that there are none but madder colours,
the alumine and oxide of iron bases of which have been fixed
on the stuffs by means of the oily alkaline solution, that can
acquire perfect fixity by the action of heat os boiling water;
and that the fixity is very inferior in all madder colours the
earthy and ferruginous bases of which have been applied to
stuffs by means of acid solvents.
    Alumine, fixed in abundance on cotton or linen stuff by
means of a highly concentrated alkaline solution, attracts
very easily the colouring parts in the process of maddering.
The cafe is not the fame when the fame earth is applied by
the most highly concentrated acetic solution of alumine ; and
it is absolutely impossible to finish maddering at one time,
even when a profusion of madder is employed, and the opera

my observations prove in the mean time that maddering, in

XLTV. A          new Method of separating Silver alloyed with
              Copper in Bullion.       By C. Napione f.
M.LETALLTJRGISTS
per, which
                                   well know that argentiferous cop
                 does not contain half its weight in silver at least,
cannot be subjected to cupellation.            In that case, recourse
is had to an operation, called liquation, with lead ; but, un
happily, it is attended with inconveniences which in many
cafes render it impracticable.
    To extract silver from copper completely, in one liquation,
practice has fliown in the founderies where this operation
is   performed on a large scale on black copper, that for a
quintal of the latter there must be at least 70 or 80 pounds of
copper, and more than 8 or 9 ounces of silver ; and in this
cafe the proportion of lead to the copper ought to be 11 parts
of the former and 3 of the latter.
    But as in billon (base) money the silver generally forms
from i-i2th to i-4th of alloy, and sometimes more, it is
evident that several liquations must be repeated to impoverish
the copper ; for though in the first the lead carries with it a
great deal of silver, it is not always in the fame proportion,
and the latter portions are more difficult to be extracted.
    If we suppose that four successive liquations are sufficient
to extract the silver of our billon money, which is of the qua
lity of 3 deniers 10 grains, estimating it at the lowest, we
should nave 55 livres for the whole expense of the separation
for each quintal of that money.
    If the process of the celebrated Cramer, of which M. Jars
has given a stiort account in the third volume of his Poyages
Metallurgies ues, can be attended with any advantage,                     it
would, however, be of very little use to us.
    C. Napione, knowing that sulphur has a greater affinity
for copper than for silver, conceived the idea of reducing into
scoriae a large quantity of rich copper by combining it di
 rectly with lulphur, in the hope of obtaining, by this kind of
dry depart, the silver concentrated in a portion of the copper
    * Concentrated acetic solution of oxide of iron is attended with nearly
 the fame difficulties.

                                                                         so

so as to be able to refine           it immediately by cupellation,               and
to obtain       at the fame time scoriae, less rich, for amalgam
ation.
  The experiments which        he relates prove that he was not
deceived    in his expectation. He took a pound and fix ounces
of argentiferous copper of the quality of 3 £ deniers the marc,
and, naving fused it in a crucible, mixed with it two ounces
of sulphur. Having separated the matte or scoriæ, he repeated
the same operation twice on the cupreous regulus ; and after
the three operations he obtained 1 pound 5 ounces and 22
deniers of matte, and 4 ounces 16 deniers and 12 grains of
metallic regulus, which, though pretty ductile, split at the
edges when flattened with the hammer.
    The trial made on mattes or scoriæ of three meltings united,
showed that they contained only 11 pounds <\ ounces of silver
in the docimastic quintal, and the quality of the regulus was
7 deniers 16 grains per marc; a quality at which it may be
subjected to cupellation without any other process.
    After having well pulverized the mattes, and mixed with
them muriate of soda in the proportion of 12 to 100, and
the fame quantity of quicklime, and after calcining it for
four hours under a muffle, he amalgamated              the mixture.
The result of this amalgamation and of a subsequent one
procured him only a very small quantity of silver.         He again
calcined       it,
               for three hours and     half, with i-ioth muriate
                                                  a
of soda and after three calcinations of the fame kind under
           ;
 the fame circumstances, and three alternate amalgamations,
his mattes contained no more than             ounce and 18 deniers
                                                           1
of silver per quintal.
     C. Napione observes, that      his first calcination had been
                                            if
 carried further, he could have extracted the whole of the
 silver in three amalgamations.     Having repeated, indeed, the
 fame operation at iHe mint, employing ihe fame proportion
 of sulphur, he was able, after three successive calcinations
 and three amalgamations, to obtain          residuum, which con
                                                           a
 tained only an ounce and        half of silver per quintal.

 silver extracted on this occasion was of the quality of 11 de
 niers and 22 grains.         was of importance, after this last
                                It

 that a proper degree of heat could be given to the bason and
 the fused metal. The bra/hue being very dry, a quintal of
 our billon money was fused in the bason through charcoal ;
 and the charcoal being then removed from the top, a work
 man, furnished with a long iron spoon, threw sulphur on the
 melted mass, while another workman stirred the matter with
 a clay rod. In proportion as sulphuret of copper was formed,
 the surface of the mass was sprinkled with a brush dipped in
 water, and another workman, with an iron fork, removed
 in plates the matles as they became fixed.       There was ob
 tained in this manner, after the operation, a cupreous but
 ton, and mattes nearly in the fame proportion, and contain
 ing the fame quantity of silver, as in the trials on a small
 scale.   A quintal and a half of matter was thus fused al
 once, and it is probable that a greater quantity might be
 fused in the same manner.
    The mattes, well pulverized, were subjected to calcination
 with muriate of soda and Jime in a cupelling furnace ar-
.ranged for that purpose.
    After a calcination of ten hours, the matter was amalga
 mated in one of those mills commonly used in the mint for
 extracting silver and gold from the refuse of different opera
 tions. After the sirll amalgamation, which lasted only 14
 hours, the third, part of the silver contained in the oxide was
 extracted ; and, as it is in the second amalgamation that the
greater part of the silver is attacked by the mercury, we may
 conclude, without any danger of being deceived, that three
 amalgamations will be more than sufficient to extract, on a
large scale, the whole silver of the mattes.
    These mills, which contain from 26 to 30 pounds of mat
ter, may be put in action, to the number of forty, by a single
water-wheel : besides this advantage, their capacity may he
augmented.
    By the process of C. Napione, not only silver but the gold
united with it may be extracted from argentiferous copper;
and this may be done by one liquation.
    As the water oHhe wastiing or the first amalgamation con
tains a great deal of sulphate of copper, the metal may be.
extracted from it by cementation with iron, or by precipi
tating it by carbonate of potash, which will produce cupreous
carbonate of a bright green colour.       The fame water after
wards evaporated gives sulphate of soda in abundance.
    The water of the second wastiing and the third amalgama
tion is colourless; and there maybe extracted from     it,  with
advantage,  by   evaporation, muriate and carbonate of soda.
    The oxide of copper freed from the silver may be sent to

  C. Napione, having calculated the expense necessary for
his process when executed on a large scale, concludes that,
in the present circumstances, it will never amount to a fifth
part of that which refining by common liquation requires.

         favoured with yours of the 15th instant. The model
   the guttering-plough sent you, was a present to the Society
from his Grace the Duke of Bridgewater, made by Robert
Tomlinson,        of his Grace's constant workmen.
                  one
     I
     procured   the  following account this morning from the
duke's farmer : — In clay or stiff land that lies flat, the plough
cannot go too deep ; but if it lies on a declivity, about five
inches deep is sufficient. In soft light soil, the plough should
go as deep as it can in all situations, because the fides moulder
into the gutters.   The best time of draining is about Mi
chaelmas, or as soon as the grafs is eaten ; and the whole
should be accomplished betwixt that time and Christmas.
   In clay ground that has never been drained, fix good horses
will be requisite to draw the plough.         In every following
year the plough should be run through the same gutters, ana
four horses will then be sufficient.    I am, Sir,
                               Your most obedient servant,
                                                          Thomas Bury.
  P. S. The (hare of the plough must be well steeled, and
should be ground sharp.

 were employed to form drains with the plough at proper in
 tervals : the small drains were made at the distance of about
 nine yards from each other, in old furrows of the ground,
 and about five inches deep : the sod, when cut out by the
 plough, was of a wedge-like form, and turned out by it upon
the ridges of the land, entirely separated from the drain or
gutter.     These sods were afterwards divided across, by a
ipade, into lengths of about two feet each, then tossed by a
 pitchfork into a cart, and placed in a heap in the field, along
with strata of quicklime in a powdery state: the whole mass
was reduced to a compost by the frost during the winter, and
in the following spring was laid upon the surface of the land,
and formed an excellent top-dressing.
    The water from the small drains was directed into larger
drains, made by lowering the share of the plough to the
depth of nine or more inches. Little or no loss of land arose
from the small drains, as natural grasses were produced there
in early in the spring. It will be highly advantageous to re
peat the operation every winter : it is easily and expeditiously
performed ; and no person, without an actual experiment of
the fact, can form a sufficient judgment of the great benefit
arising to vegetation by the removal of cold stagnant water,
during the winter, from land of every description.

               sent you a small instrument for sowing turnips,
           have tried on several different soils, and think I can
venture to assert, that it will sow the seed and cover it per
fectly well in any soil that is nearly in a proper state to re
ceive it.    It is necessary either to harrow the ground across,
or to roll         it,
                previously to the instrument being used, that
the labourer may see the rows he has made           but   have                 :        I             al
ways found the crop to succeed better after the roller than
after the harrow, though the ground has/been very strong.

  N. B. The angle which forms the edge of the wheel A, must

and weights, as well as the period of the invention, is totally
unknown. The author, however, has collected the researches of
learned men on this subject, and refutes the opinion of those
¦who make the invention to be not older than the 14th century.
The invention, however, was not very great, as the more per
fect water-clocks were before that period furnished with
•wheels, so that the only improvement was the subflitution of
a solid body to act as a moving weight instead of water. The
principal point was to produce uniformity in the action of
these weights ; and in this respect the first clocks moved            by-
weights were deficient till the time of lluvghens.          It not
                                                                 is
therefore to be wondered at, that the application of weights
to clocks asa  moving power should excite so little attention
as to be scarcely thought worth notice             by
                                               cotemporary writ
ers  : water and sand were indeed more convenient than a
solid weight, which requires too much room for its motion.
The author  is of opinion that the origin ofclockswith weight*
is as old as the  1ith century, and adduces verv probable
grounds in support os       but       not properly ascertained,
                        it      it
                                is

whether the inventor was an European or Saracen. The    a
oldest complete clock moved bv weights, of which there                is
any certain testimony,   isthat sent    bythe sultan of Egypt in
the year 1232 to the emperor Frederic II, the value ot which
was at that time estimated at 5000 ducats.        In the 13th cen
tury many of the church-steeples             Italy were furnillied
                                              in
with clocks moved bv weights that struck the hours. About
the fame time the well-known clock-house at Westminster-
hall was furnished with.a clock that struck the hours; the ex
pense of which was defrayed bv          fine imposed on one of
the judges.    The clock moved         by a
                                          weights of the abbot
Richard of Wallingford, which     by many has been considered
as the oldest, was constructed in the 14th century.         In the
                                                                  yew

In   the year '523, the sines levied from the students at Oxford
were employed to defray the expense of the clock erected on
tfce church of St. Mary.     Private individuals, however, about
this time began to obtain clocks. The first instance of a clock
with weights being employed for astronomical purposes oc
curs in 1484, when Walther, as he fays, with a well regu
lated clock, made an observation of Mercury.          Tycho had
three of these clocks, which (bowed minutes and seconds : he
found, however, that they were exposed to variations from
the influence of the atmosphere and wind ; on which account
he caused to be constructed a quicksilver clock, in which
distilled quicksilver, instead os sand and water, showed mi
nutes and seconds.      To produce an uniform full, so much
quicksilver dropped from another vessel into the hour-vessel
as was sufficient to keep it always at the fame height.      As
the study of astronomy required more accurate measurers of
time, we are indebted to that science for the improvement of
these instruments, the construction of which does so much
honour to the human genius.
    VI. Invention of watches and tttbh-chchs. — HeleofNurn-
berg is generally considered as the inventor of watches or
spring-clocks, as they ought properly to be called ; the.
first of which he is said to have constructed in the year 1500.
According to others, Halbrecht of Strasburg was the in
ventor: but his first clock was constructed in 1520, and con
sequently twenty years later than Hele; who, it is certain,
made small spring-clocks or watches so early as 1500.
Nurnberg and Augsburg were the first cities of Germany in
which watches were made. Hele's watches not only indi-

    cated the hours,          but    struck        them    also.        Andrew Heinleiff,
    who trod in Hele's footsteps, made small clocks in the smell-
    ing-balls which were used in his time. In the architectural
    office at Augsburg there is a watch, above 2CP years old,
    which strikes the hours : it is contained in a crystal cafe,
    and was made by Buschman.             There were striking watches
    in France in the time of Louis XI. The oldest watch in
    England, that goes still prettv well, is of the year 1540, and
    is preserved in the palace of Hampton Court.

     end of the 16th centurv,         whom    by  not known, and was

    thence introduced into Germany.           was examined geometri

     the balance,       means of which the power of the spring can

    land about the beginning of the 18th century.             In the first
    watches with fusees, the diameter was small, and the box
    large and broad. The catgut,             which    by

     passed eight  or nine  times  around   the fusee.  This made the
    watch clumsy and ill-shaped.. The catgut, however, was soon
    exchanged for       chain, which consists of small plates of steel
                         a
    united together with great labour. In the middle of the 17th
    century, Huy<;heris invented       better method of regulating the
                                              a
    movement of clocks.        In the year 1657 he applied the pen
    dulum as    a regulator to large clocks moved        weights; and,    by
    some years after, recommended the balance spring for watches.
    Before that period some had used, instead of the Ipoon-formed
    balance, one in the form of            ring, or employed
                                                    a               small                 a

    then  a weak, straight, steel spring, for regulating the balance.
    In the year 1674 Huyghens caused watch with spiral ba  a                      a
    lance spring to be constructed         Turet at Paris.

     jijlronomy — Piazzi's Planet — New Lunar Equations.
    About the beginning of December Baron Von Zach ob
 served Piazzi's star in a group of others; but, having nothing
 to distinguish it from them, he was not able to find it again,
'and to allure himself that he had seen          it,
                                            till towards the end
 of that month. Dr. Olbers had observed           also at Bremen,
                                                       it
 about the same time.     The difficulty which astronomers ex
 perienced in finding   it,
                          must be ascribed to its smallness and
 the unfavourablenefs of the weather; for, according to the
 elements which M. Gauss deduced from the observations of
 Piazzi, an instrument could be easily directed to the altitude
 of this star, and in two minutes      would have been
                                        it                    the

 middle of the telescope.   Before we received this intelligence
 from Germany, we endeavoured to take advantage of every
 moment when the lkv was favourable. C. Mechain, whose
 researches were less interrupted, and who had observed all
 the small stars amons: which the planet could reappear, per
 ceived it,  for a  moment, on the 23d of January; but day
 having surprised him loo soon, he could only examine in
 haste the configuration of the stars which occupied the field
 of the telescope. On the 24th, however, he examined with       it
 more accuracy.      On the 25th he communicated to us his
 observation. There remained then no more difficulty.          In
                             S3                               the

That of Piazzi escapes the belt eve, even when it attempts to
find it in the place indicated by the telescope, in which it has
been observed.      It is indeed only of the seventh magnitude :
owing, however, to an union of circumstances in this season,
it appears in all its splendour ; for it is at its nearest distance
to the earth, and at a small distance from its perihelion.         It
was   much   less brilliant when found : it can never  now  be  lost.
    C. Flaguergues, associate, has sent us observations he made
at Viviers.     Among these is a new determination of the la
titude of that place, which he has found to be 18" further
north than marked in the Conrunffance des. Terns ; also, ob
servations of several spots, and particularly two which have
reappeared at the fame place after cue or two revolutions of
the fun around his axis.
    C. Laplace has communicated to the class his labours for
improving the theory of the moon. He has announced th3t,
instead ot one equation of a long period, of which theie was
 some reason to suppose the existence, he has discovered two.
This complication rendered the labour more difficult. Be
 tides, lluse analytical calculations are so embarrassing, and
 depend on substitutions so delicate, that it is proper to call in
 the aid of observation to fix the precise value. But as the pe
 riod of these new equations is more than 180 years, we cannot
 flatter ourselves with the hope of knowing both with com
 plete accuracy until one or more periods have been observed.
    Experiments ivlncb prove that all bodies, of *vb /ever na
 ture, arc subject lo the magnetic influence, by C. Coulomb.
 The new experiments undertaken 'by Coulomb, and which
 he repeated before the Institute, induce us to believe that the
 action of magnetism extends throughout all nature, since of
 all the bodies hitherto tried none of them has escaped the in
                                                             fluence

flocnce of the artificial magnet. But this action, though
 real, has not the fame force in all bodies ; and in the greater
part it is necessarily very small, fince it has hitherto eluded
the notice of philosophers.
    C. Coulomb gave to each of the bodies which he tried the
form of a cylinder or small bar : in this (late he suspended
them by a thread of silk, such as it is when taken from
the cod, and placed them between the opposite poles of two
bars of Heel.    The silk thread can sustain no greater weight
than eight or ten grammes without breaking; it was there
fore necessary to reduce to very small dimensions the needled
formed of the different bodies subjected to experiment.
C. Coulomb made them of from- seven to eight millimetres
in thickness: those of metal he made only one-third of that
size.
   For these experiments he placed the bars of steel in the
fame straight line, their opposite poles being distant from
each other five or fix millimetres more than the length of the
needle which was to oscillate between them.         The result of
these experiments has shown, that of whatever matter the
needles consisted, they always arranged themselves exactly in
the direction of the two bars; and that, if removed from this
direction, they always returned to it by oscillations, the
number of which was often thirty in a minute.        The weight
and figure of the needles being given, it was therefore easy
to determine the force which produced these oscillations.
   These experiments were made in succession with small
plates of gold, silver, copper, lead, and tin; small cylinders
of glass, a bit of chalk, a fragment of bone, and different
kinds of wood.

   C. Seguin, associate, read two memoirs respecting cinna
bar; in which he endeavours to prove that ethiops and cin

exygen and hydrogen : that these two substances differ from

each other only in the proportion of their principles, and par
ticularly in the decree of the union of their moleculæ ; that
this proportion and this degree cF union are invariable in the
cinnabar, and, on the other hand, very variable in the ethi-
ops : and, in the last place, (hat cinnabar is composed of
thirteen parts and one-third of sulphur, and eighty-fix parts
two-thirds of mercury.
    C. Seguin has written a third memoir on colophonium.
After having shown that good colophonium is nothing but
resin completely purified from essential oil, and from which a
portion of it3 hydrogen has been taken ; and after having
          that the colophonium used in commerce is more or
  ess deficient, he indicates a new process for obtaining it of

    Mineralogists     had  hitherto considered the oisanite or ana-
tase   of Haiiv  as a  peculiar kind of stone.   But Vauqaelin, bv
subjecting this mineral to analysis, has found that it is crys
tallized oxide of titanium.         The anatase, therefore, must
hereafter be classed among metals, and in the titanium genus.
However, as the form of this mineral is not the fame as that
of native oxide of titanium, Vauquclin thinks there is rea
son to presume that the anatase holds in combination some
substance which has disturbed the common order of crystal
lization ; and this he proposes to verify when he can procure
a sufficient quantity of this matter,.
    C. Sage has described in a memoir processes by which he
Was enabled to separate, in the dry way, silver from cobalt,
and to purify the latter substance, as well as nickel, in such a
manner, that these two semi-metals, when fused into thin
plates could be easily magnetized according to Coulomb's
method ; and that, when suspended by a silk thread, they
indicated the poles, aud exhibited the magnetic phænomena
obst-ned by Klaproth, H:iiiv, and some other philosophers.
    The fame chemist read another memoir on the alteration
produced by light on sulphurated        red arsenic, known under
 the name realgar.        He has shown that this realgar and orpi-
ment, or yellow ore of arsenic, are onlv the same substance
differently coloured ; thru light changes realgar into orpi-
 ment ; and that the latter mineral, which panes to the state
 of realgar by the action of fire alone, returns to that of orpi-
 ment merely by the contact of light.

colleagues, the Royal Society of London decrees every year
a prize, founded hy Copley, to the person who has written
the most important work in regard to the sciences.
     "I request permission from the Institute to place in the

         MTJSÆUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, PARIS.
    A letter from C. Martin, dated Cayenne, 28th December,
contains very satisfactory details respecting the cultivation of
the spiceries : he only waits for the favourable season to under
take some trials in regard to that of the pepper plant. Victor
Hugues, agent of government, has assigned to him a piece
of ground tor that purpose.       The object is to ascertain what
are the trees fittest for serving as props to the pepper plants,
giving preference to those which, being susceptible os multi
plication by slips, have a thick spongy bark, and which rising
to a small height have, however, a long duration.          But this
is not the only result which it is wished to obtain by these
trials.   The island of Cayenne is the district which was first
cultivated in that colony; the foil in some parts is ex
hausted,    and it is necessary to leave it at reft before any
other plants can be committed to it with hopes of success :
besides this inconvenience, it is exposed to a scourge still
more prejudicial to cultivation, — it is ravaged by ants, which
                                                            devour

among the nutmegs which are sown, and which germinate
exceedingly well, there is a much greater number of male
than of temale individuals.         He proposes also to graff the
latter on the males, and to try for this purpose the different
processes likely to produce a satisfactory result.
     In regard to the bread-fruit trees, they thrive in an ad
mirable manner. C. Martin announces that he will soon
have twelve new layers to separate from their parent stock.
Pome of them have already suckers, and the rest will have
them soon.      He has observed, that layers in general, if the
branches are somewhat strong when they are buried, will
produce fruits the fame year.
     A letter has been received from C. Reidle, the gardener
 who accompanies captain Baudin, dated Isle de France,
 April 20, iKcsi. The following is an extract from it:
     " We arrived here on the 14th of February, five months
 after our departure from Paris.       Our passage from the island
 of Teneriffe took up more than four. You have no doubt
 learned the accident which I met with two days before            I
 quitted the island. I fell from a rock about 45 feet in height,
 in consequence of which I was confined to my bed during
 three months.     I still suffered from my wounds on my arrival
 at the Isle ofFrance; and I entertained great fear that this
 misfortune would have prevented me from labouring during
 the remainder of the voyage.        But, thank Gad, I recovered,
 and now traverse the mountains as before.          I have already
 collected 255 species of plants, without reckoning double
  specimens for the herbal of the musæum.
      " I have made a catalogue of the colonial garden. I have
  marked those trees which are found in the Musæum of Paris,
  and those which are wanting there : the latter are in number
  sixty.   C. Cere has promised to give me plants on our return
  from the South Sea.       I have given him in exchange the fol
  lowing trees : two free olive, two pears, two apples, a cherry,
                                                                 an.

flowers of Europe. During our passage I planted walnuts,
and raised a multitude of young plants.       I have distributed
about thirty in the colony, and have sent several to the Isle
de la Keunion.
    " I cannot inform you whither we shall go when we leave
the Isle de France.     This day we have received orders to go
on board, and we are ready to fail.     But every thing in our
expedition has been greatly changed : our touching here has
been hurtful to it in more than one respect. The sailors have
deserted to go on board privateers.   Some of them have been
caught. The captain has landed two sick officers.        Several
of the naturalists seem determined to go no farther: as for
my part, I shall proceed with the vessel wherever it goes."
    By a second letter, dated the next day, C. Reidle an
nounces that the departure of the vessel was fixed for the 23d
of April : he thinks that they were bound to New Holland.
           BRITISH MINERALOGICAL SOCIETT,
    In the beginning of the year 1799 a few gentlemen attached
to the studies of mineralogy and chemistry, with the view of
illustrating an interesting department in the natural history of
their native country, which had hitherto been pasted over with
flight regard, agreed to form an association for this purpose
under the name of the British Mineralogical Society. They
saw, with regret, while institutions of this kind were multi
plying in the states ot Germany and other parts of the con
tinent, that the Britiffi islands, among their general and pro
vincial societies, possessed none whose attention was specially
directed to this important object.     Without being jealous
of foreign interference, they were sorry that Englishmen
should be almost wholly indebted to strangers for an acquaint
ance with their own mineral treasures, and that the names
                                                               of

•they may be to the public,     are essential  to the prosperity   of
the Society.      Having overcome most     of the difficulties which
at first presented, ana having received from various quarters
unequivocal assurances of cordial cooperation, the Society
feels itself called upon to make a public official statement of
its objects, and to communicate from time to time such
abstracts of its proceedings as may contribute in any degree
 to the advancement of science or the arts, and convey to the
 corresponding members a brief but faithful record of the la-
bours of their associates.
    One of the primary objects is to obtain as much informa
 tion as possible concerning the local or geographical minera
 logy of Britain. On this account the Society is strenuously
 exerting itself to obtain lists of mines, quarries, and mineral
springs, from the different counties, together with specimens
 and such particulars as the proprietors may be willing to com
 municate.     From many of the corresponding andordinary
 members, the Society expects also, with confidence, to receive
 accounts, as accurate as circumstances will allow, of the pre
 valent rocks and strata in various mineral districts, their ex
 tent, direction, and other particulars which may hereafter
 serve as materials upon which to found a general history of
 the mineral topography of the island. Among other valuable
 communications already received for this purpose, a manu
 script map of Cornwall deserves especial notice.
    A very serious obstacle to mitieralogical inquiries is the
 want of an uniform nomenclature among those who are ac
 tively engaged in the working of mines : the fame substance
 is not unfrequently called by different names, or the fame
 uame is applied to different substances even within the fame
                                                              mineral

 $,$$               British Miner ahgical Sciietj,
mineral district; the scientific and technical terms are per
 petually at variance, and give rife to innumerable errors. A
 reform in the language of the miners, how desirable soever*
is yet wholly impracticable ; but the Society expects to render
no small service to future mineralogists, by collecting front
 Cornwall, from Wales, from Derbyshire, and other districts,
full and accurate lists of the miner's terms, accompanied by
illustrative specimens, the former of which, in due time, will
be laid before the public, and the latter will be preserved in
the Society's cabinet as authorities, to which a liberal access
will at all times be allowed.
    When it is recollected how often valuable ores, by appear
ing under an unusual form, or by presenting difficulties in
their analysis that are not to be overcome by the common
methods, are neglected and thrown aside j it will not be
deemed a trifling object in the Mineralogical Society to un
dertake the analysis of specimens of this description.                 All
such will be gratuitously analysed, provided the conditions
                                                                     * are
already specified in the circular letters of the Society
strictly complied with.
    The above are the leading views of the British Mineralo
gical Society, and will always occupy the principal part of
its attention.     It is by no means, however, intended to neg
lect other objects : the examination of minerals which have
been either not at all> or but imperfectly investigated, will
occasionally form a part of its employment, and every occur
rence that throws light upon the difficult subject of chemical
analysis will be carefully registered in the books of the Society.

       Dr. Olbers's planet has, we understand, been seen in Eng
    land by Mr. Stephen Lee, of Hackney, and Mr. Aubert, of
   Highbury, who both agree that it has a greater resemblance
   to the old planets than Ceres Ferdinandea.
                               ANTIUDITIES.
       A superb statue of Achilles, nine Roman palms and a half
   in height, and in perfect preservation, has been lately dug
   up in the environs of Ostea.        The hero holds a metal lance
   in his right hand and the parazonium (sword) in the left t
   the helmet, which covers his head, has         a large plume similar
   to that   of the celebrated statue of the Villa Borghese, which,
   is not of so excellent workmanship.           This production, the
   work of one of the best sculptors Greece ever produced, is not
   inscribed with the name of the artist. The inscription Votiva
  Marti, engraved on one of the legs, proves that it was conse
   crated to the god of war.
                         UNCOMMON DISEASE.
      The thigh of a woman, who lately died in Geneva, has
  been sent to the Medical Society of that city, as exhibiting
  a very extraordinary phœnomenon.            It is stuck quite full of
  small thorns, which the woman, it appears, had been in
  the habit of swallowing, and which gradually making their
  way through the intestinal canal and the blood-vessels, ulti
  mately lodged hi the femoral muscles. C. Albert is appointed
  to draw up a report upon the circumstances of this singular
  case.
      A case somewhat similar occurred some years ago in the
  infirmary at Nottingham. A woman was admitted as a pa
  tient, from one of .whose breasts a number of pins were dis
  charged with excruciating pain ; and the disease was by her
  ignorant neighbours ascribed to the effects of witchcraft.
  The breast was obliged to be cut off, and the woman reco
  vered perfectly ; but, strange to tell, instead of being cured of
  a habit of putting pins in her mouth when undressing,             and
  with which she often went to sleep, in some time after, she
  returned to the infirmary, and was obliged to lose the other
  breast.     We do not recollect whether slie recovered after this
  second operation.

  gence has been received at the Hague of a dreadful explosion
  of the burning mountain in that island. For some time be
  fore, the air had been humid, accompanied by subterranean
  noises; but so violent an explosion has not been known for
  many years. All the plantations were entirely devastated ; a
, great many inhabitants        lost their lives, and the country, to
  the extent of several miles, was as inundated by the lava.

 knew the subject of this memoir, will not, it is believed,
judge it otherwise than impartial, though, confessedly, a tri-
Tuite from his nearest relative, one who reveres his memory
with the truest affection, who^ through the early stage of life,
 received froni him, as from a father, the genuine dictates of
wisdom, virtue, and religion; all of which were truly exem
plified in his own conduct throughout the whole of his life."
 From this relation he imbibed his taste for botanical studies;
and it was prolvblv through his instigation that he was de
stined to the medical profession.
    The youth's first situation in a professional capacity was
that of apprentice to an apothecary in Loughborough ; an
humble school, which, however, his industry and talent
for observation were able to render instructive. He passed
through the usual course of a country education, and then
complied with an invitation to settle at Leicester. That town,
like most provincial capitals, was divided into two political
and religious parties ; and it was that of the dissenters (to
which his parents belonged) whence Mr. Pulteney received
his support.    His sphere was still further narrowed, by the
limitation of practising only as an apothecary ; for it was
thought due to the consequence of the party, to possess a
surgeon of their own as a separate professional character,
which office was filled by Mr. Cogan, a man of merit and
agreeable manners.
    Few remarks can be necessary on the hardship of placing
persons of abilities and liberal sentiments in situations so un
favourable to the acquirement of that reputation and those

buying books, to which he was content to sacrifice every
other inclination. Science was, indeed, his great resource
under the discouragements of his situation, and it eventually
proved the means of raising him from obscurity.       To his
private friends he was known as one who had inquired largely
and thought freely on a variety of topics. To the public he
first appeared as a votary of the pleasing study of botany. He
became a correspondent of the Gentleman's Magazine at an
early period ; and communicated to             it,
                                             anonymously,         serie*

of valuable letters concerning the poisonous plants of this
country, and       dissertation on Fungi, contained
                   a                                           in

volume of that miscellany. To the same publication he sent,
in 1757,  a  translation of     curious paper in the Upsal Ama-
                                a
nitates Academics on       "  the Sleep of Plants."     This subject
he pursued more at large in             paper inserted in the 1th
                                           a
volume of the Philosophical Transactions, for 17,58, entitled
"   Observations on the Sleep of Plants, with an Enumeration
of several Plants which are subject to that Law." He had
before appeared among the contributors to the Philosophical
Transactions        by" Catalogue of the rare Plants of Leicester
                       a
shire, with Botanical and Medical Observations;"             vol. xlix.
for 1756.     Thrs paper he gave to Mr. Nichols, in an im
proved state, in 1795, who has inserted                   in
                                                    the first volume

Gentleman's Magazine,           translation from the same Araœ
                                a

a  catalogue of plants which, from experiment, were found to

domestic quadrupeds.         This he adapted more particularly to
English readers            by
                          referring to English authors; and he
subjoined to      some notes and observations. Its utility caused
                  it

to possess a friend whose ardent and enterprising spirit was an
admirable corrective of his own diffidence, and who esteemed
him too much to acquiesce in his continuing in a rank and
¦employment     beneath his merits.   This was Mr. Maxwell
Garthshore, then eminent in medical practice at Upping-
ham, in Rutlandshire. By means of a common friend, much
revered by both, they were made acquainted in the year 1758,
and this acquaintance soon ripened into a warmth of friend-
iship which death alone could extinguish.       As it was Mr.
Garthshorc's own plan, after a residence for some years at
Uppingham, to take the degree of doctor at Edinburgh,
where he had received his medical education, he strongly
urged Mr. Pultenev to accompany him thither, and otter
himfelf to the examinations of the university, though he had
never enjoved the advantage of academical instruction there
or elsewhere.     His re'uctancc was at length overcome ; and
the two friends set out upon their expedition in the spring
of 1764. Mr. Pulteney was already known by reputation at
Edinburgh, particularly to Dr. Hope, the professor of botany;
and he had the benefit of his companion's extensive connec
tions in the place.    He passed through all the necessary pre
liminaries with credit, and in May received the honours of
graduation.      The         of his inaugural dissertation was
 " De Cinchona," subject
                     or, On the Peruvian Bark; of the natural
and medical history of which important article he gave a very
satisfactory and instructive account. The botanical descrip
tion is particularly accurate, and is illustrated by a plate;
 and his Thesis has been thought worthy of reprinting in a
collection of the most valuable compositions of the kind which
ihe medical school of Edinburgh has produced.
    A circumstance relative to his graduation, honourable to
                              T%                        himself,

should have thrown occasional discredit upon academical ho
nours; nor that the public should have been prone to con
found the degrees conferred at universities similarly consti
tuted, in one general note of disesteem. The Edinburgh me
dical students justlv considered themselves entitled to be re
garded among thole of the profession who had received the
greatest advantages of education, and were the most deserving
of those testimonials of competency which titular distinctions
imply.      They had therefore begun to remonstrate against a
mode of conferring degrees which might confound them with
persons altogether unworthy of the honour; and their dis
content had been aggravated by some late instances of noto
rious incapacity in Edinburgh doctors by favour. Thinking
 their complaints nol sufficiently attended to, some of the
 students of the longest standing had entered into a mutual
 engagement publicly to oppose everv suture attempt at deco
 rating with the degree of doctor of physic at Edinburgh any
 person who should not have studied there, and to take their
 own degrees elsewhere in case their opposition should prove
 unsuccessful.
     It happened that Mr. Pulteney was the first candidate under
 these circumstances, after this resolution was adopted.    The
 subscribers handsomely expressed to him their concern that
 a person of his acknowledged merit should be the object
 of their opposition ; but they adhered to their determina
  tion.    His reputation and interest carried him through the
  contest ; but he was (I believe) the last in favour of whom
  the condition of studying at that individual seminary has
  been violated.    And so sensible have the Edinburgh pro-
  festbrs since become, that augmenting the credit of their uni
  versity's degrees, and the difficulty of obtaining them, was
  conducive lo their own personal emolument, that they have
  extended the period of requisite study there from two to three
                                                           years,

and advantage, had not the death of the earl followed so
speedily, that Dr. Pulteney received only one quarterly ad
 vance of his intended salary.
    Not long after this event, a medical vacancy happening at
 Blandford, in Dorsetshire, he was urged by Dr. Watson, Dr.
 Baker, and others of his friends, to go down and occupv it.
 Provided with their warm recommendations, but an utter
 stranger to all the inhabitants of the town and its vicinity,
 he fixed his abode in that spot which was to be his residence
 during the whole remainder of his life. A small country
 town, in the midst of a neighbourhood composed of the
 usual ingredients as provincial society, was not, perhaps,
 exactly the situation most desirable to a man whose mind
 was enlarged by free speculation and scientific pursuit : but
 it was now Dr. Pulteney's business to establish himself in his
 profession ; and to that object, prudence required that sacri
 fices should be made.      This     indeed, the condition of all
                                   is,
 who have their way to make in the world; and perhaps          a
just fense of true dignity of character, as well as regard to
pecuniary advantage, should lead       man to place before him,
                                         a
as his primary object, the attainment of success     in  the pro
 fession which he has chosen   ;    and to consider as secondary
 and subordinate all reputation or gratification derived from
other sources. Dr. Pulteney, therefore, seems to have fat
down with the resolution, not only of fulfilling his medical
duties with the utmost punctuality, but of avoiding every
thing which might    in   the least degree involve him in  differ
ences with those on whose good opinion he was to depend.
He was sensible that   by  his removal he had entirely changed
bis latitude; and though he was not         man to shift his fen-

394                   Biographical Account of
 timents and language according to his company, yet he was
 constitutionally cautious, and could, without much effort,
 practise the allowable policy os silence.
                                               " Commune with
 thy heart and be still," was the maxim of 36 years of his
 life. That it exerted its natural influence upon his character,
 will not be denied ; but it did not prevent him from being a
 very amiable, useful, and respectable member of society.
     The situation of Blandford had not hitherto afforded any-
 great scope for medical practice; but Dr. Pulteney soon ex
 tended its limits.   His reputation spread through the circum
jacent country, and he received professional calls from the
 market and trading towns in a compass of twenty or thirty
 miles round his centre, as well as from many of the country
 families of principal distinction in that part of the kingdom.
 As his industry was great, and his expenses were moderate,
 he began to accumulate property.         He continued to live in
 a state of celibacy till October 1779, when he married miss
Elizabeth Galton, of Blandford.       He could not have chosen
 more fortunately for domeltic happiness^ and the addition
 this connection made to his comforts was proportionable to
 the want he had previoufly felt of that society which alone
 can interest the heart.    No children were the fruit of this
 union ; but in the additional society of an amiable young
 relative of Mrs. Pulteney he enjoyed the pleasure of an adop
 tive parent.
     He continued to employ his leisure in occasional writings
 on topics of medicine and natural history.       In 1772 he ad
 dressed   a letter to his friend Dr. Watson (published in the
 Philosophical Transactions, vol. Ixii.) concerning the medi
 cinal effects of the Œnantbe crocala, an umbelliferous plant
 of a poisonous nature, the juice of which was exhibited, by
 mistake, instead of that of the water- parsnep.    In the Ixviiith
 volume of the same collection, for 778, he gave an accurate
 account of the bills of mortality for the parish of Blandford
 during forty years past, with observations.     To the London
 Medical Journal, vol. v. he communicated an account of the
 poisonous effects of the Hemlock Dropwort, (the Œnantbe
 crocala above mentioned.)
     He had hitherto appeared as an author only in detached
 memoirs inserted in periodical publications.        But in j 781
  he ventured to offer to the public a separate volume, on a
 subject, indeed, with which no man could claim a more in
  timate acquaintance.      This was " A General View of the
  Writings of Linnæus," 8vo. The purpose of this work was
  to afford an exact synopsis of all the labours of the great
  Swedish naturalist, who appears to have been the object of
  (t<t,„ :                                                      his

his    warmest admiration.            Along with the account of his
works, memoirs of his life are interwoven, chiefly extracted
from the different writings of Linnæus.                   In the prefatory
advertisement Dr. Pultency speaks with great modesty of his
 performance, which, however, was very well received by the
friends of natural hillory, and obtained for him the present
 of a medal from Stockholm, as an acknowledgment of the
justice he had done to the fame of the illustrious Swede.
 Many judicious observations and valuable points of informa
 tion are interspersed in the work. It concludes with a synopr
 tical account of all the papers contained in the first seven,
 volumes of the AmasnitaUs Academicce .
     Some years afterwards a more extensive and original work
 proceeded from Dr. Pulteney's pen, and which mutt have cost
 him much varied research in its composition. This was his
 " Historical and Biographical Sketches of the Progress of
 Botany in England, from its Origin to the Introduction of
 the Linnæan System ;" a vols. 8vo. 1790.                    He paid a just
 tribute to scientific      merit  in  dedicating  the  first volume of this
                    to Sir Joseph Banks; and a grateful return tp
   ong friendship, in inscribing the second to Sir George Baker
 fterformance
 aud Dr. Garthfhore.             The work itself is highly valuable, as
 an example       of  that   union  of the history of men with that of
 an object       of  their    common      pursuits Which is so peculiarly
 interesting     and   instructive.     It has likewise made an addition
 to national biography, which will be duly prized by those
  who are attached to their country's reputation.                It is marked
  throughout      with    that   candour     and  disposition   to  commend
  which always characterized the amiable author.
      Whilst he was thus tracing the progress of his favourite
  science in books, he was by no means inattentive to the
  volume of nature as it lay displayed before him. The county
  in which he resided is considerably furnished with objects
  worthy the notice of the naturalist, especially in the fossil
  kingdom.        Haw well he had made himself acquainted with,
  these treasures, the present writer obtained a proof, which
  laid him under a particular obligation.             This was a brief but
  masterly     account   of  the products   of Dorsetshire,   communicated
  to him for the use of his little work entitled
                                                            " England Deli
  neated."       He afterwards enriched the second edition of Mr.
  Hutchins's " History of Dorsetshire" with a catalogue of the
  birds, shells, and plants observed in that county ; and during
   his last illness he had under revisal a plate of Dorsetshire soffits
   communicated by himself. The formation of a miisæum was
   the amusement of many years of his life.                 By gradual addi
   tions, he accumulated a store of natural productions in various
                                       T4                               classes,

 templation, and will, doubtless, become to many students of
 nature a means of instruction, in the possession of ihe Lin-,
 næan Society, to which it was bequeathed.
     Dr. Pulteney, in his latter years, frequently expressed a
 wish to retire frrom business, and take up his residence in the
 metropolis, for the fake of the scientific advantages with which
it is so amply furnistied ; but hi* habits of life were become
 too strong to permit him to resolve upon so great a change.
 He continued, though with diminished ardour, to follow nis
 professional avocations, till he was attacked with a pleuritic
 complaint, which, after great sufferings, put a period to his
 existence on October J3, 1801, at the age of 71.
     By his last will he gave a signal proof of the deep impres
 sion which h's early friendships had made upon his mind,
 and which no subsequent connections of common acquaint?
 ance could obliterate or equal.     After a handsome provision
 for those who on every account were entitled to the first place
 in his remembrance, the remaining objects of his liberality
 were loinc of the friends of his early days, and even the sons
 of thole friends. He likewise paid a due attention to the
 claims of charity by bequelis to the Salisbury, Leicester, and
 Edinburgh infirmaries, and to the poor of the parish of Bland-
 ford ; and he dilplavedhis regard to science by similar boun
 ties to the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and
 to the Linnæan Society.
     Such are the brief memoirs which I have been able to col
 lect concerning Dr. Pulteney ; whose life affords, indeed, but
 little biographical variety, but presents an encouraging pic
 ture of modest merit gradually making its wav 10 success, and
 science, even of the most retired kind, becoming the passport
 to public esteem and reputation.

          DEAR SIR,                                 April 10 1^02.
     IT    is with pleasure I fit down to make you acquainted
 with some particulars relative to the friend and tutor of my
 youth the late Dr. Pulteney, with whom I had the happi
 ness and the benefit of enjoying the most familiar intercourse
  for the space of more than two years and a half, from the
  beginning     of March   1760, to the middle   of October 1762;
                                                                 that

ties in his profession, from whom he derived little information,
but in the common processes of pharmacy : for every thing
more than this, he was indebted to his own genius and in
dustry.
   A  taste  for botany he imbibed almost in his infancy, from
his uncle Tomlinson, who was a botanist of the old school.
    His first attention to this pursuit was merely the effect of
imitation. Seeing his uncle searching for plants, as they
walked together in the fields ; seeing him take them home,
examine them bv the descriptions of Gerard and Ray, at that
time the sole, or at least the best, and certainly the only good
guides in tnglisli botany, and compare them with the rude
wooden cuts of the former ; di'play some of them upon paper,
press -and dry them, and tit them for a place in his Hortus
Siccus ; he began to do ihe fame, to ask his uncle the names
of plants, to nuike imitative collections, to draw up infantile
catalogues and descriptions of the plants which he found
within the circle of his botanical excursions and researches;
and sometimes he added figures of such as he admired for
their beauty, or esteemed for their rarity.
    How early he was a botanist appears from what he fays
ynder the article Campanula patula in his " Catalogue of
some of the more rare Plants found in the Neighbourhood
of Leicester, LoughborOugh, and in Charley Forest," in
serted in the introductory part of the first volume of Mr. Ni
chols's History of Leicestershire, at p. clxxvii., where he has
this note: — " In the drier parts of Buddon Wood, and the
hedges and lanes adjoining.            First discovered in England by
Mr. Brewer, in 1726, near Worcester, as recorded by Dr.
Dillenius.      Next in this place (Buddon Wood) by the writer
of this catalogue, in 1742, who a few years afterwards com
municated the feeds to the gardens of Chelsea and the British
Musæum *."

                                                                     th»re,

298                           Biographical Account         of
    Of his youthful catalogues above mentioned I have seen
 and examined several, with descriptions   and coloured draw
ings of the most remarkable plants, in very small books. They
were drawn up at different times, and, like the different edi
tions of a book, were progressively improved and enlarged as
his experience in botany and his knowledge of the plants in
the neighbourhood were improved and enlarged.            Some of
them were,           I
                believe, made as early as when he was only
eight or nine years of age; and I particularly remarked that
or the Campanula patula, which, as we have seen, had not
been many years Known to be an indigenous plant of this
island, and which he himself had discovered 111 and near
Buddon Wood in the year 1742, that                         is,

    This taste, once implanted in his mind, grew and flou

provement in the fame way.       Imitation gave      turn to his            a
pursuits; and excellent abilities, united with indefatigable
diligence, led him on to that perfection in both the scien-
tifical and practical knowledge of botany,         study at that        a
time but rarely cultivated, lo which he afterwards attained,
and which at length railed him high         the estimation, and

ences and varieties ; in drawing up lists of those which he
had investigated ; in making memorandums of the places in
which he had found those which were less common, and of
the natural habitations of all ; and drew up, occasionally,
botanical tables, as well illustrative of the Linnæan system,
as of other matters interesting to the accurate botanical
student.
    But while he attended so diligently to the improvement of
his knowledge in botany, he was not less diligent in the
study of the theory and practice of medicine, of chemistry,
and of every branch of science which could contribute to the
advancement of his knowledge of that profession to which
he had dedicated the most serious business of his life, and in
which his success was no less remarkable than in his bo
tanical pursuits.
     His most favourite medical writer was the celebrated Fre
deric Hoffman, whose voluminous works he read over and
 o'er with indefatigable attention and perseverance.       Indeed,
 in whatever study he was engaged, his diligence was intense.
 I have often known him to fit, when the engagements of his
 profession did not call him from his studies, and have often
 fat with him, for whole days together, without interruption,
 but by the necessary interposition of meals, to which, on such
 occasions, we usually turned with reluctance.         Sometimes,
 when he was very intent upon a subject, he had a habit, not
 to be commended, of overspreading his pillows with books,
 of reading, and referring from one to another ; in short, of
 studying in bed till very late, sometimes till long after mid
  night.
     These habits of close application, both by day and night,
  served to render more delicate an originally weak constitu
  tion; and might have been seriously pernicious in their con
  sequences had they not been frequently interrupted, and
  sometimes for long intervals, by the necessary business of his
  profession, which, though not great, was not inconsiderable,
  and by long botanical excursions,     which we used to make on
  foot, once or twice a week in the summer months, aud not
  rarely in those of spring and autumn.
     He took great delight in the history of science and litera
  ture, and of scientific and literary men ; in which he was a
  most diligent inquirer, and h.id collected a stock of informa
  tion, both published and original, of which few men are pos
  sessed.   But nothing seemed to give him such exquisite plea
  sure, or so to excite in him the ardour of enthusiasm,     as the
  lives and travels of naturalists; and especially the herborizing
  adventures,   the great fatigues, the hair-breadth escapes, the
                                                      discouraging

 300                  Biographical Accmint  of
 discouraging difficulties, and the happy success, so common
 and so interesting in the narratives and histories of the bo
 tanist who engages in travels of discovery.
    He read the modern Latin books of medicine and natural
 history with great facility; and was particularly conversant
with the works of Hoffman, Van Swieten, Ray, Rumphius,
Van Hoyen, Linnæus, and of some other eminent medical
 and botanical writers : but had little studied, and read with
difficulty, the classical Roman writers of antiquity ; and those
of Greece not at all. In the French language he was com
pletely versed, and read a good deal.
    The acquisition of a new book of merit gave him the most
sensible pleasure.    The joy which he expressed on the first
arrival of the second volume of the so greatly enlarged tenth
edition of Linnætts's Syjlema Nature, which was published
at Stockholm in 1759, of which I was a witness, I shall never
forget. He seized upon it with eagerness, ran over it with
avidity, and could scarcely quit it till he had drawn up an
analysis of the whole, which, f think, he sent to the Gen
tleman's Magazine, as he had before sent an analysis of the
first volume to the fame valuable repository.
    His constitution was from his birth so delicate that his
parents found difficulty in rearing him ; and experienced
great anxiety about him, as he was an only child.         At the
time when 1 was in his family he had frequent illnesses, very
commonly from fatigue, especially from riding on horseback,
which alwavs, even after short journevs of perhaps ten or
twelve miles, very much discomposed him, and after long
rides brought on a considerable, degree of fever.        He had
frequent ulcerous (ore throats of a very uncommon kind;
being accompanied with great debility, but very little fever;
scarcely any swelling, and no great inflammation of the
throat, tonsils, or uvula ; but large sloughs, commencing and
running from these parts, which were very rapid in their pro
gress, but soon yielded to the use of the Peruvian bark and
proper gargles, without producing any alarming symptoms
or great suffering.    1 was then very young in the knowledge
of physic; but these ulcerous, spreading floughs appeared to
me, as they did to him, very singular; and I have never
met with any thing like them since.
    Great as wa< his attention to medicine and natural history,
his reading was not confined to books in these branches of
knowledge only.       He was well read in history, morals, and
the philosophy of the human mind; to the latter of which,
he paid particular application ; and, while he studied with
diligence the appearances of external nature, and the structure
                                                            and

Stamford.      This acquaintance and correspondence with Dr.
Watson began before or about the time of his first entrance
upon business.     Having long been in the habit of reading
the papers of that eminent botanist in the Philosophical
Transactions, in the xliid volume of which, No. 471, for
November and December 1743, his first botanical paper was
published, being an
                        " Account of Dr. Haller's Enumeratio
Stirplum Helvetia, extracted and tranflated from the Latin,"
&c, and to which he had continued to contribute frequent
botanical as well as electrical and medical papers ; and hav
ing, therefore, long admired him as an experienced and first-
rate botanist, he conceived a strong desire of cultivating his
acquaintance, took opportunities of sending him botanical
communications by letter; and at length, having occasion to
make a journey to London, introduced himself to him per
 sonally ; and, being kindly received, from that time a regular
 correspondence and friendship commenced between them,
 which did not cease till the death of Dr. Watson. This in
 timacy, I have good reason to believe, commenced soon after
 he had finislied his apprenticemip; and not only opened to
 him the most unreserved intercourse with Dr. Watson when
 ever he had occasion to visit London, but was the means of
 his introduction to the acquaintance of many other men of
 eminence, as philosophers and naturalists.
     At the time when I was his pupil, his Horlus Siccus of
 Briiisti plants was very large ; and was particularly copious
 in the order of grasses, in the collection and investigation of
  which he had been singularly iudcfatigable.
     He not only" corresponded with, but was visited by, the most
  eminent philosophers and naturalists. Among those who visited
  him while I was an inmate in his house was the earl of Mac-
  clesfield, then, I think, president of the Royal Society, who,
  I remember, was uncommonly pleased with his large and
  beautiful collection of English grasses.

 Analysis      of   the  Red Oclaedral          Copper Ore,     in which the
      Metal exijls in a        State    hitherto unknown       in Nature.
  J.N the course of the experiments which have been stated in
 the preceding sections, I have had occasion to examine a great
 number of copper ores, and particularly of copper ores from
 Cornwall ; but the only one which has afforded any interest
 ing results, is the well known species called red copper ore,
 crystallized in regular and brilliant octaedrons.                It has been
 so long known, and so often mentioned by mineralogists, that
it may excite our wonder when we reflect, that its chemical
 nature has never been ascertained.                  For it would be an in
justice    to   that  very  accurate     and  scrupulous    analyst M. Vau-
 quclin,   to  suppose   that  he  meant     to  pronounce    decidedly upon
 that point by the single experiment which he had made*,
and which is mentioned bv the abbe Many in a short extract
of his crystallographical arrangement of mineral substances,
 published in the Journal des Mines.
     RomedeLifle, the baron de Born, Lametheric, the abbe
Hauy, and indeed every other mineralogist, concur in calling
this substance red calx of copper; but some of them assert
that it contains a portion of carbonic acid.                     Among the
many analyses which have been made of this ore by Fon-
tana, Monnet, De Born, Renovantz, and others, I could
not find one, that in the proportions, or even in the ingre
dients, resembled what I had sound to be its contents.                    The-
    * He mcr ¦I poured muriatic acid upon the ore; and, as it was entirely
difl'oU ed, without effervescence, concluded it to be an oxide, and not a car
bonate, of copper.
                                                                       highest

highest amount of copper (that given by Fontana) does not
exceed 66 per cent., and is far short of the real quantity.
The remainder, as he states, consists of water and of pure
and fixed airs.         The difference in the results I had obtained,
together with some new facts, which I had occasion to ob
serve during my experiments, induces me to treat the subject
at some length ; referring for its external characters to those
mineralogilts above mentioned, who have amply described
the ore, and confining myself entirely to its chemical ana
lysis, and some analogous experiments.
     One hundred parts of very pure and regularly crystallized
red copper ore were reduced to a fine powder, and diflolved,
without the assistance of heat, in nitric acid.
     During the operation, a very violent effervescence, accom
panied by a disengagement of nitrous gas, unusually copious
and rapid, took place.              When these phænomena had sub
sided, the       solution   was   blue, like every other nitrate of cop
per;      and   the  ore  had  entirely disappeared.      The liquor, per
 fectly limpid,       was    evaporated    to dryness ;  muriatic acid was
 poured      in,  and   the  nitric  acid  was   expelled by a second   eva
 poration.        Into   the   muriate    of copper,   which remained    be
 hind,     a  plate   of  polished    iron   was  immersed,   which,   after
 the usual phænomena, gave a precipitate that was found,
 upon examination, to be copper, and amounted to 88,5.
 In order to complete the hundred parts, it would be neces
 sary to add 11,5.           But fire expelled from the ore neither
 water nor any other volatile substance ; nor did the weight
 of a given quantity appear either to diminish or to increase
 by long exposure to a moderately elevated temperature.                 The
 only oxide os copper with which I was acquainted, as exist
  ing in nature, contains 20 per cent, of oxygen. I had there
  fore 8,5 of copper exceeding the quantity I should have ob
 tained had the ore been wholly composed of black oxide of
 copper. And, on the other hand, as 1 had convinced myself
 that no loss of weight had been occasioned by any part of the
  metal remaining unprecipitated by the iron from its solution,
  I could not conclude the ore to be in the state of native cop
  per. I was led, therefore, to imagine, that it might be a
  mixture of those two substances ; and that muriatic acid, by
  dissolving the one, and leaving the other untouched, would
  be the most effectual means of producing the separation                   I
  desired, and of determining the proportion of each.
      Upon 100 parts of the ore a sufficient quantity of strong
  muriatic acid was poured.              A total solution was effected, ac
  companied with disengagement of caloric.                The liquor was",
   at first, of a very deep Brown, approaching somewhat to the
                                                          4            tmge

tinge which water will receive when strongly impregnated
with the colouring matter or dried \egetable substances; but,
upon being exposed to the air, and boiled some time, it be
came like everv other muriate of copper ; and a plate of po--
lifted iron precipitated 88 of metallic copper. From this last
experiment it was evident that no metallic copper was con
tained in the ore.         But still the deficit to be supplied by oxy
gen   amounted       to  no   more than i 2 ; while the copious dis
engagement      of    nitrous  gas, in the first experiment, indicated
that the metal was not at its maximum of oxidation ; and the
rapidity with which it seized upon an add t ion of oxvgen*
sufficiently showed how strong was the affinity of that prin
ciple for copper, in that particular state in which it exists in
the ore.
    I imagined it would be expedient to attempt some precipi
tations by other reagents, and make some further experi
ments.     For this purpose, I dissolved some more of the ore
in strong muriatic aciJ ; and, when 1 though) that the acia
had taken up as much as it could contain, and that the co
lour had arrived at its deepest tinge, I gently drew off the
clear liquor, using all the precaution which the nature of the
experiment allowed, to preserve it from the contact of the
atmosphere, and proceeded to examine it.                    Knowing this
solution of muriate of copper to be very concentrate, I at- ,
tempted to dilute it ; but what was mv surprise, when, upon'
the first affusion of water, I saw the liquor become turbid
and milky, and a very abundant heavy precipitate, of a white
colour, fall to the bottom !
    Struck with the novelty of this appearance, I proceeded to
collect as much of the substance as I could, in order to ijive
it a thorough examination. For this purpose, I decanted the
supernatant     liquor, and continued to wash the precipitate.
Upon every subsequent addition of water, I perceived that
the precipitate lost a little of its whiteness, and drew towards
an orange colour, not unlike the precipitates of platina.               I
soon sound, therefore, that by this method I had no chance
of obtaining, in a permanent and constant state, this muriate
of copper,    fit  to he subjected to experiments proper to deter
mine its internal nature and proportions.             I   then attempted
to make use of alcohol, ns precipitant, instead os water; but
I  found the salt to be soluble        in   it,  when the excess  of    acid
 necessary  for   its  solution in     water   was  prelent.      Nor  was
 more successful, when, after having precipitated           by         I I
                                                                   water,
 washed with alcohol    ;     for the colour of the salt passed gra
 dually from very white to      a       shade of orange
                                                      ;      less rapidly,
                                                                       it
is  true, in  this     cafe,  but      so
                                    still     as to  convince     me that
                                                                       I
                                                                       could

                                                       liquor, and
then proceed to wash copiously.       The precipitate will by de
crees assume an orange colour, which, as we shall presently
see, is the real appropriate colour of this oxide of copper,
prepared in the humid way.
   It is evident also, from this precipitation, that this oxide
of copper combines with muriatic acid by a very slender af
finity.
   As it  did not appear to me, that I should obtain any thing
very satisfactory from this combination with muriatic acid, £
resolved to try some other acids.     Sulphuric, phosphoric, ox
alic, citric, acetic, tartareous, and acetous acids were each
poured upon known quantities of the ore, and kept in bottles
completely filled and well stopped, in order to prevent any
absorption of atmospheric oxygen.         The liquors generally
became blue ; and, upon trial, were found to contain the
common and well known salts of copper, composed of the
respective acid, and the oxide of copper containing 20 per
cent, of oxygen ; while a large portion of the ore appeared to
remain in its original (late.    But. as I was certain that there
could be no decomposition in molt of these acids, under the
above circumstances, and moreover, that no oxygen could be
taken in from the atmosphere, it became a matter of no small
interest to examine from what source the metal dissolved had
acquired the necessary quantity of oxygen to favour its solu
tion, and aiford the usual salt os copper, in which it is oxidated
in the proportion of 20 per cent.
   I repeated, with all the above acids, the experiments tend
ing to satisfy that inquiry ; but, as the results from all were
nearly similar, I shall mention that only which proved to be
the molt ample and the most conclusive.
   One hundred parts of the pulverized ore were introduced
into a small phial, and dilute phosphoric acid was poured in,
so as to sill it.  A inouud-stopper closed it completely ; and
   Vol. XII.      No. 48.          U                            in

ally, nitric acid was added, and the whole gently heated.
A complete solution followed, during which much nitrous
gaS was disengaged.     The remainder of the nitric acid was
expelled by evaporation ; and a plate of polished iron, im
mersed in this muriate of copper, afforded a precipitate of
metallic copper, weighing within one part as much as the
weight of the first residuum.  It was evident, therefore, that
a partial reduction of the ore had taken place ; and, what is
still more strange, had taken place by means of the presence
of an acid.
     In many observations which have presented themselves in
the course of various analytic experiments, something similar
had before occurred to me.           I have known metallic oxides
yield a part of their oxygen, one to the other, in favour of
some particular solvent.       When the metallic oxide A, for
instance, containing 25 per cent, of oxygen, is in contact
with the metallic oxide B, containing 10 per cent, they will
each remain quiescent in their respective states.       But, if the
solvent C comes to be added, and if the substance B, at 10
per cent, of oxygen, has no affinity for C, but at 15 or 20
per cent, has a very powerful affinity for       it, then may the
oxide A lend  a   part of its oxygen, in order to favour the com
bination of B, at 15 or 20 per cent, with the solvent      C     In
deed, as soon as  I   saw the phosphoric acid assume gradually
a  blue tinge, and the undissolved powder begin to wear           a
more brilliant appearance,  I      imaginedI   mould not fail to
recognize the same fact    in  this cafe.   When phosphoric acid
has remained long enough upon the pulverized ore to dissolve
 allit   can, the oxygen   is   concentrated, as  it  were, to the
 amount of 20 per     cent,   in the part which  is dissolved
                                                            j    and
 all that which could not be dissolved has (through the two
 fold affinity of copper for oxygen, to the amount of 20 per
 cent, and of phosphoric acid for that oxide of copper, at that

degree  of oxidation,) yielded up its entire share of oxygen, to
favour the combinations which take place in a new order,
the only one which can exist among the substances now pre
sent,   it      is,
               therefore, to the disposing affinity          caused *,                 by
the presence of the phosphoric acid, which seeks to combine
with black oxide of copper, that the reduction of 41 per
cent, of this ore       entirely to be attributed.
                          is                            All the acids
above mentioned are capable of producing the fame change,
but in   a manner,' perhaps, not quite so distinct or satisfactory.
    From the foregoing experiments            appears, that copper
                                                  it
exists in this ore in    state hitherto unknown in nature; and
                           a
that  it contains much less oxygen than has ever been sus
pected      any oxide of copper; for, from the quantity which
           in
was precipitated in the metallic state            by
                                               iron,    appears to be

combined in the proportion      of about    1,5 per cent. To con

seems to arise merely from the tenuity of its molecules, com

green,     and then blackish, leaving a mark of the fame fliade
upon the paper.        Were it not for this property of changing,
it might be of use in the art of painting ; for the colour is
extremely beautiful, and would be highly valuable if durable.
    The precipitate caused in the muriate of copper by the car
bonates of potash and soda, is of a brighter yellow, and is a
 real carbonate of fuboxide of copper.          But, if ammonia is
poured, at first in a small quantity, into the above solution,
the precipitate is blue ; and, upon adding an excess of the
precipitant, the whole is redissolved, and the liquor is like
any other ammoniacal solution of copper.
    In order, however, to determine in what state the copper
was dissolved by that alkali, I poured some ammonia upon
 100 parts of this fuboxide in a well-closed phial.      The liquor
became blue ; and I expected to find that part of the ore had
been reduced, as with phosphoric acid ; but the residuum was
entirely soluble in muriatic acid, with the usual phænomena.
    A spirituous tincture of galls, poured into muriate of fub
oxide of copper, afforded no precipitate, owing, I suppose,
to the excess of acid; but sulphurated hydrogen gas threw
down a black, and prustiate of ammonia a lightish brown,
precipitate.
    I endeavoured to obtain muriate of fuboxide of copper by
evaporation, and by distillation in a retort; but, as I could
perceive the liquor constantly assume a blueifh tinge, I could
not reckon upon the purity of the fall, sufficiently to submit
it to analysis.
    Such were the principal experiments, which the fleeting
and precarious existence of the salt allowed me to make upon
it. But, from some properties which 1 had remarked, I could
perceive that this ore was a natural oxide of copper, nearly in
the fame stale as that artificial oxide which Mr. Proust had
found in the white muriate of copper, obtained by pouring
a recent solution of muriate of tin into a solution of muriate
of copper.
    If, however, by the very nature of the substance, (which,
as   I  saw it ever changing, I thought it would be loss of time
to examine further,) I have been turned aside from more cer
tain results, I have been more successful in imitating by art
the    state of this natural product.
    By    exposing oxide, hydrate, or carbonate of copper, with
out addition, to a violent heat, in an open crucible, I fre
quently obtained the fuboxide, which then presented all the
properties already recognized in the above species of copper
 ore. In one instance, I so far succeeded, that, upon the very first
                                                         inspection,

                      of Cofper and of Iron.                   309
inspection, the well-experienced eye of the Count de Bour-
non recognized a lump of it to be a mass of semi-fused,         ar
tificial, red copper ore.
    But I have found a method of producing at pleasure, in
the humid way, all the new salts, and the oxide above de
scribed.     As I had found about 11,5 per cent, of oxygen to
be the quantity contained in the ore, I took that quantity of
black oxide of copper which corresponded to 11,5 of oxygen;
 (57,5 of black oxide was the proportion thus indicated;) on
the other hand, I took 50 parts of metallic copper, which
had been precipitated by iron from muriate of copper, and
which was in a state of tenuity not inferior to the finest pow
der.     These were well mixed, by trituration in a mortar, and
   ut, with muriatic acid, into a well stopped phial.       A vio-
r
leent disengagement   of caloric took place ; the liquor became
of the same colour as with the ore, and contained a salt in
every respect similar to that afforded by the ore ; while a por
tion of metallic copper remained, with all its lustre, at the
bottom of the phial.      The solution was decanted, and the
residuum of metallic copper weighed 7,5.            Consequently,
42,5 had been dissolved, which, with 57,5 of black oxide,
complete the hundred parts.
    No experiment could prove, in a manner more satisfactory,
the quantity of oxygen contained in 100 parts of this sub-
oxide; nor could any afford results more important, or more
conclusive. The paflage of a portion of oxygen from one part
of the metal to another, to favour its solution, as already
stated, is proved beyond the possibility of doubt; and is
doubly interesting, as it is the inverse of what happens to
the ore when treated bv phosphoric acid.
    In the experiments of Mr. Proust, he has estimated the quan
tity of oxygen, contained in 100 parts of this oxide, to be 17.
This proportion was calculated upon the deficit of a single
analytic experiment, made upon the salt of muriate of sub-
oxide of copper, after having determined the quantity of acid,
of water, ;md of metallic copper.      But, first, the salt cannot
easily be obtained (as I have before observed) in a state suffi
ciently certain to be relied on, in an experiment of this na-»
 ture; and, in the next place, it is probable, as happens in
 almost every analysis, that the deficit was greater than the
 real quantity of oxygen.     For, the agreement between the
 analytic- and synthetic experiments I have just stated, seems
 to confirm 11,5 to be more exactly the proportion.
    When, in the dry way, the above proportions of metallic
 copper and of black oxide of copper, or, when metallic cop
 per with a corresponding proportion of hydrate or of carbon

ate  of copper, were intimately mixed, and heated at a low
red heat, the oxvgen seemed to he equally distributed through
all the mass; and every particle seemed perfectly homoge
 neous.
      In the ore here spoken of, it is by no means rare to find
 large pieces of real native copper; and, whether we consider
 it mineralogically or chemically, it certainly is an interesting
 substance.     But, how much more will it be esteemed, if it is
 regarded    with  a view to public utility !
      The Baron de Born has mentioned a gray cupreous pyrites,
 which, he fays, contains 90 per cent, ofcopper. I have ana
 lysed a similar one from Cornwall, (gray vitreous copper ore,
  p. 212,) which I foundto contain 8(f of the fame metal. But
  if we reflect, not so much on the quantity as upon the ex
  treme purity of this copper, and the wonderful facility with
  which this useful metal may be extracted, it will be found
  much superior to every copper ore hitherto discovered.              It
  would be well worth the attention of miners, to keep a con
  stant look-out for this substance, which, I am informed, is
  not rare in Cornwall.       It contains no iron, and no sulphur;
  the absence of which latter is a peculiar advantage.          It is a
  fact not generally known, I believe, that there is hardly such
  a thing in commerce, as copper which does not contain a
  little sulphur ; at lead, I have rarely met with any such ; and
  it requires but a very minute portion of sulphur to increase
  the fusibility ofcopper.      The advantage of obtaining copper
  free from sulphur, is too obvious to require to be pointed out ;
  and that advantage does this ore possess.
       To work it separately, if ever it fliould be sound in sufficient
  quantity, would well repay the labour it would cost ; and a
  very small mixture os any disoxidating substance would, in a
  short time, reduce immense quantities.
       From the foregoing experiments we may perceive into how
  many errors we may be drawn,        if,  in arguing from the results
  which we obtain, we pronounce too hastily upon the state in
'which substance exists,
        a                        inthe subject of any analysis. After
  what has been shown, with regard to the action of muriatic
  acid upon   a   mixture of metallic copper and black oxide of
   copper, both reduced to powder, and of the action of phos
   phoric acid upon the ore itself,    it   may be still
                                                       a  doubt whe
   ther this ore  is  really a   suboxide, ora    mixture of metajlic
   copper and oxide of copper, at 20 per cent, of oxygen.          But,
   as similar proportions of both, after having been made red-
   hot, presented all the properties and appearances of the ore
   much more strongly than when simply mixed,                it  fair to
                                                                  is

been used, the natural conclusion would have been, that the
ore was a mixture, or at most a combination, of these two
substances; for such did it appear to be by (he testimony of
the other acids.   The truth          is,
                                  we are but little acquainted
with the exact state in which substances exist in many na
tural combinations. However, in the mineral kingdom, such
fallacious conclusions are less frequently to be dreaded than
in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.          But, in every re
search, it   important to leave as little room for them as pos
             is

with    a practical contrivance for finding the distance at any
time by these data, are aimed at in the following scheme.
     Let a small globe of metal be attached to the end of a line
which is to be passed over pulleys fixed in the stern-post of a
ship, in such a manner that this globe may be drawn through
the water after the sliip at so low a level as not to be affected
by the ship's wake or the motion of the rudder, and so that
the other end of the line may be conducted into the vessel,
where it is to be joined to the end of a strong spiral spring of
sufficient size and elasticity to express, by distinct expansions
 and contractions, everv variation of resistance which may
 affect the immersed globe. If a fliip, furnistied with such an
instrument, move at sea with an ascertained degree of velo
 city, and if the expansion of the spring, at the same time, be
 marked on a scale annexed, this degree of expansion will be
 peculiar to that degree of velocity ; and if the scale be silled
 with all the useful graduations taken from actual experiment,
 the sliip's rate of motion may be known thereby at any time,
 whatever the law of hydrodynamic resistance may be.
     Then suppose a cup, with a small perforation in the hot-
 tom, containing that sort of metallic sand which is used for
 hour-glasses, to be joined to the extremity of the spring, the
 stream of sand which issues from it will have a common mo
 tion with the spring, so that the point of the scale on which
 this stream falls will mark the rate of progress, and (since
 land* flows equably) the quantity which falls upon that point
 will mark the time, the product of which quantities is the
 distance passed over during that lime.               Therefore, if there be
 a receiving vessel for the sand, divided transversely into several
 compartments, so that the partitions between them may be
 at the fame distances asunder as the graduations of the scale,
 the sum of the products arising from the multiplication of the
 quantities of sand received in all of them, by the velocities de
 noted by the compartments which hold them respectively,
 will be the distance sailed at any time.
      However, though this method furnishes quantities from
 which the distance may be computed, considerable delay
  must arise from the measurement os each separate portion of
  sand, and the multiplication of each of these by its respective
  degree in the scale; which difficulty may be removed in the
  following manner :
      It is evident, from the nature of the scale, that the orifices
  of the compartments of the receiver must he unequal; but if
     * It   h: s been proved, by experiment, that the discharge of sand in this
  cafe  will  be the lame in tejudi times, whether the superincumbent weight
  be great or small,   — contrary to the established laws of Jiuiiis.
                                                                         they

products is equal to the single product of the distance of the
common centre of gravity of the fallen sand from the ex
tremity of the receiver, by the weight of all the fallen sand;
and, if the receiver be furnished with a falling handle, this
centre of gravity may he found at any time by finding tenta
tively that point of the handle by which it may be suspended,
so that the receiver containing the discharged sand may not
incline to either fide : and if this experiment be made with
the hook of an ounfel containing a scale graduated for the
purpose, the weight or quantity of sand discharged may be
known; also, if the falling handle be graduated into equal
 parts, corresponding with the divisions of the compartments
 at the bottom of the receiver, and marked with numbers re
 presenting the rate of sailing which these divisions denote,
 the number on this handle at the centre of gravity, multiplied
 by the number on the scale of the ounfel, will show the di
 stance sailed at any time.
     In order to adapt this instrument to the seaman's use, it is
 necessary to consider the irregularities of motion occasioned
 by the waves, and to provide against their effects. These are
 of three ,forts. First rolling, or a motion about the longitu
 dinal axis of the stiip, which does not seem capable ot dis
 turbing the operation of the instrument.      Secondly, he-zvny,
 which takes place when a stiip moves in any direction except
  that of her keel : in this cafe, the string, being drawn trans
  versely, will not have its full effect on the pulley at the bot
  tom of the stern-post, but will act as an oblique force, and
  consequently the distance will be represented too little ; to
  remedy which, the lower pulley must be formed so as to bave
  a motion like that of a castor on the foot of a table, whereby
  it may be turned by the line into its own direction, and then
  the action of the ball will produce the required effect. Thirdly,
  filching, or a vibrating motion about the transverse axis,
   which, if the string to which the ball is fastened be short, in
  an high sea, would give a serpentine motion to the ball, that
   would represent the distance greater than it should bej to
                                                            prevent

  prevent which, the string is to be of such a length as to ren
  der the angle through which it vibrates very minute, whereby
 its tendency to deflect the ball from a rectilinear path will be
  diminished ; and if (as Mr. Boyle and others assert) the
 greatest height of a natural wave be no more than fix feet, h
 will not require a very long radius to render the angle sub
 tended by a fine of six feet so small, that the divarication
 occasioned by it may "become inconsiderable.
    This may be subjected to experiment in an easy manner :
 let a boat, with the instrument annexed, be drawn on a canal
 through such a serpentine line in an horizontal plane as it
 would describe in a vertical plane in pasting over waves, and
 the effect on the ball will be the fame in both cafes ; by which
 means it will be possible to find the error occasioned by pitch
 ing, and the length of string necessary to reduce it.
    It may occur as an objection, that the immersed ball can
 not be kept at the fame depth at all times, and that it mav
 receive different degrees of resistance from the fame velocity
 at different depths, which must occasion error : but the expe
riments of C. Coulomb, published in the Physical Memoirs
of the French National Institute during the third quarter of
the year 8, tome iii. p. 288, prove the reverse; his words
are — " L'on peut conclufe de cette experience que Iorfqu'un
corps submerge se meut dans un fluide, la prestlon ou la hau
teur du fluide au dessus du corps n'auginente pas sensiblement
sa resistance."
    But the greatest difficulty attending this scheme is to form
the scale os the spring that is to ascertain the several degrees
of pressure which a globe of certain dimensions meets from
the several requisite degrees of velocity.      For this purpose,
let a man be furnisiied with a slender chain one yard in
length, so fastened between his shoes as to limit the length
of his steps; let him keep his eye fixed on the vibrations of
a pendulum, and, by stepping to the full length of his chain
in time with the oscillations, nis motion will be equable, and
the rate of it will be exactly known.        Isa man so prepared
stiould draw a boat along a stagnant canal, the rate of the
boat's motion will be equable also, and ascertained ; and this
rate may be varied to any required rate within certain limits
by'altering the length of the pendulum: then if the instru
ment be attached to the boat, the expansion of the spring at
each degree of celerity with which the man proceeds may be
marked on the scale : for the higher degrees of velocity the
man's motion must be increased by some mechanic power,
as the axle in the wheel, whereby additional force may be con

verted into velocity, and the degree of velocity ascertained by
the power of the machine. This experiment should be made
in a wet dock silled with sea water.
      It should also be observed that these experiments will afford
a scale which will answer only for balls of the fame dimension
as that with which the original experiment was made, and
therefore the mould of the original ball should be preserved ;
but this is not the cafe of the spring, for the scale of any
spring may be easily found when the scale of one is graduated
 in this manner        :
      Let   the extremities of the new spring and of the original
 spring be joined, so that they may act against each other;
 then pull them asunder until the index of the original spring
 shall touch some graduation, and then the scale of the new
 spring may be marked where its index then stands, with the
 degree of velocity at which the index of the original spring
 stands ; and in this manner all the necessary graduations may
 be transferred from one scale to another, though the springs
 should be of very different powers ; because, since the ball is
 to be the fame, the force exerted by each degree of velocity
  remains unaltered.
       However, in a very high sea this method may be attended
  with some inconvenience : the string may be frequently
  broken, and a certain degree of error will attend a very strong
     itching motion ; in which case the following method may
  E e. used to ascertain distance by means of these waves, whicb
  interrupt the operation of the instrument :
       Let any small floating substance be thrown out a-head of
  a ship at sea, and let the number of times be noticed when
  it is seen distinctly on the top of a wave ; also let the interval
  of time between the first and last of the se elevations be ob
  served by a stop-watch ; which time being divided by the
  number of elevations will be the time in which a wave passes
  through its own breadth, (because the floating body is not
  protruded bv the action of the waves.)                     But a wave passes
  through its breadth in the fame time in which a pendulum
  whose length is equal to that breadth performs one vibra
          *
  tion : and tables are or may be constructed to (how by the
   time of vibration the length of the pendulum ; which tables
   will of course show, by the time of undulation, the space
   through which any wave moves in that time, and also the
   breadth of the waves. Therefore, if a (hip sailing right be
 fore the wind were to accompany the same wave through the
       * Quære, what     effect has a current in disturbing this law of the waves »
       + Or   the breadth    ;>nd
                                  velocity of the waves may be found by an expe
   riment with the log-line.
                                                                               sea,

may be found, provided the time of undulation be ascertained
 whenever there is reason to suspect a change in the motion
 of the surface of the sea. But when a ship saris upon a ivind,
the distance deduced from these data requires correction.
Suppose two ships placed on the fame wave, and that one
runs directly before the wind and keeps time with this wave,
and that the other fails in a course which forms an angle
with the direction of the wind, retaining, however, her place
 on the fame wave ; it is evident that then the space described
by the former will be to the space described by the latter, as
the cosine of this angle to radius: also, if these ships, pur
suing these courses, pass over the fame waves, or the fame
number of similar waves, the direct path of the former in
passing these waves is to the oblique path of the latter as the
cosine of the fame angle to radius also : therefore, in failing,
upon a wind, the result which this method of calculation
gives, is to the true distance as the cosine of the angle which
the rhomb forms with the direction of the wind is to radius,
and may be corrected accordingly : or, if this angle be as
sumed as a course, and the result obtained by this method
be taken as difference of latitude, the corrected distance will
be found in the distance column of the common nautical
tables.
   But both these methods must prove erroneous where the
ship is borne, away by a current; and the common method
of estimating the effect of a current by the apparent motions
of a sunken body is fallacious; because the boat may be in
quiescent water, and the current may exist only below ; or
the upper and lower strata of water may be parts of the fame
current flowing in the fame direction with different degrees
of velocity : therefore any theory which points to a true mea
sure of currents should be announced, though it may require
long experience to perfect it.
   Let two ships lie-to at a considerable distance asunder (sup
pose twelve miles) : if a gun be sired from each from a situu»

lion which may be four yards above the water, it may be
seen from the other at an elevation of fifteen yards above the
water; and consequently, the interval of time between the
observation of the flash and report of a gun from either vessel
may be observed at the other at this distance, which time,
according to the laws of found, will be about 55 [¦seconds :
and, if there be no current, each will observe the same in
terval of time between the flam and the report of the shot
from the other ; but if they float on a current which rims at
the rate of (even knots an hour, for instance, one vessel ad
vances 570 sect towards the point whence the found issued
during the passage of the found, and will consequently hear
it half a second sooner than if flic remained at rest; whilst
the other, by receding from the former vessel, lengthens the
space through which the found is to pass by 570 feet, and
therefore will hear it half a second later : therefore there will
be an entire second os time difference between the observa
tions of the two (hips; and in such case it may be inferred
that the ship which observed the shorter interval floats on
a current which runs towards £\\e other ship, and vice
versa : so that two stiips, making this experiment in several
 points, will detect the existence of a current, and the true
direction of it; and, if it be not too much to expect from
 the accuracy of future observers, that the subdivisions of a
 second should be diitinguistied, the rate of the current may
 also be found from the distance between the ships and the
 lime of the sound's passage from one to the other, provided
 this portion of time can be measured with sufficient accuracy.

       LIV.   On the Nature of Heat.      By  a Correspondent.
  I T has long been a question whether the sensation we expe
 rience, called beat, arises from a subliance of a distinct nature
per fe, or whether it is generated from an intense vibratory
 motion of the insensible pirtieles of bodies.         In reasoning
 on this subject, our arguments can only be sounded on the
 effects that are produced by this unknown cause ; for it seems
 more than probable that the degree of accuracy of experiment
 necessary to render our conclusions certain with regard to its
 intrinsic nature, is incompatible with the present means of
 our knowledge. The following observations are intended
 therefore, by diredting the attention lo a consideration         of
 some of the chief phænomena of heat, to show that we can
                                                                seek

seek for an explanation of them in no way so satisfactorily as
by supposing them to originate from the universal presence of
a very subtile fluid called by the French writers calorique,
which penetrates,        without exception, all bodies, and is
equally diffused through all space.
    That heat is only a property of common matter, a specific
motion of the particles of bodies, is an hypothesis perfectly
inadequate to the solution of the phœnornena alluded to.
Lord Bacon is the first modern philosopher who attempted
to elucidate at length any theory on this subject ; and we find
him, in a treatise written expressly for this purpose, and en
titled De Forma Calidi, deducing, from an enumeration of
the several phænomena and effects of heat, its general pro
perties, and hence defining it to be an expansive undulatoty
motion in the minute particles of the body, by which they tend
with some rapidity towards the circumference, mid at the fame
time incline a little upwards.
    This system, which evidently considers heat not as an ori
ginal inherent property of any particular sort of body, but ass
mechanically producible in             it,
                                       was adopted          most of the
                                                                by
mechanical philosophers of that age,               by
                                                 Boyle,    Newton,    and
Descartes    ;and has been supposed to have received no incon
siderable share of weight from the later experiments of Count
Rumford and Professor Pictet. Before, however, we acknow
ledge the truth of this hypothesis,               necessary we stiould

                          is       in  its application, of accounting
for the various pha»nomena of nature             for, unless these are

we are justified in concluding that               unequal to the pro
                                                 it   is
vince assigned it. That the theory under consideration will
not stand the test that       here submitted as the criterion of its
                                is
truth, cannot be well doubted after an attention to the sol-
lowing facts: — If thermometer be placed under the receiver
                          a
of an air pump, and the air be suddenly exhausted from it,
the thermometer will fink several degrees, and very quickly-
after will rife again to its usual height.       Now        heat consists
                                                                if
in vibrations, according to the tenets of this hypothesis,                       it
may be asked, How comes              to pass that the small quantity
                                     it
of matter that remains within the receiver            first insufficient,

and afterwards sufficient, to maintain the temperature origi
nally indicated        the thermometer? This
                      by                                  fact which no

principles, and can onlv be reconciled on the supposition that

we arc entitled to presume that, where a contrary effect is
witnessed, it proceeds from the expulsion of some fluid or
matter foreign to the substance on which it acts,) is another
fact wholly inconsistent with the theory in review. Thus,
when we perceive that heat, applied to any substance, inva
riably occasions its dilatation, we arc justified in concluding
that it is enabled to produce this effect only by virtue of its
own proper extension ; and if we allow that it is capable of
extension, we cannot refuse our assent to its being a bodily
substance.     If we suppose this effect to be produced in any
other way, as by the impression of any mechanical motion
on the parts of the substance, it is difficult to conceive how-
this could produce a lasting expansion of the particles; it
would excite, indeed, an undulatory or vibratory effect, occa
sioning a change in the situation of the particles for the time,
but there would still be a tendency in them to return again
to their former situation, and an oscillatory effect only would
be produced, perfectly distinct from extension.             It    how        is,
ever, impossible to reconcile this fact with the supposition
that heat         isquality, or an adventitious and accessory pro
                       a
perty   resulting  from    the intestine motion of the particles of
 bodies, and not         substance of itself.    " Whenever," says
                "
                            a
 Mr. Locke,        we perceive       number of qualities always ex

 isting together, we arc warranted in the conclusion that there
is   some substance which produces those qualities."            If heat
 depended on motion,              natural to expect that
                                        is                    would                 di

 to observe how few things we are more ignorant of than the
  rule which takes place          in
                                 the progression and communication
 of heat in bodies of unequal temperatures.

   Thus,       we do not consider caloric as

Oxygen gas,     we  are  told,     oxygen
                                     is     combined   with heat and
light    and
          ;   thus  we  find   that, when   oxygen  enters  into com
bination with any body, the two latter are always evolved.
If oxygen          sjas and phosphorus        be presented to each other, the
oxvgen combines with the phosphorus, and the caloric flies
oss.   This      readily accounted for on the supposition that
                       is
caloric      fluid sui generis, and therefore capable of attrac
              is   a

haave, Lavoisier, Black, Crawford, and Fourcroy, arc among
the most celebrated partisans of this doctrine, which, for its
beautiful simplicity, its perspicuity, and the ease with which
it    applicable to all the phænomena of heat,
     is                                               much supe         is
rior to that which still divides in opinion many of the philo
sophers of Europe.      The strongest, and indeed the onlv ar
gument of weight that has been adduced against this theory,
is that of Count Rumford, arising from some experiments
made       him concerning the source of the heat excited
              by                                                                       by
friction.   From the accuracy with which these experiments
were conducted, and the nature of the result,          certainly        it              is
not very easy to draw any inference that        perfectly satisfac
                                                              is
tory.         evident that
              It   is         change of capacity in the body, as
                                 a
                                                                has

links in the chain, than as involving any insuperable obstacle
to the doctrine itself? And should it not lead us, instead of
abandoning, to review our theory with more circumspection
and a greater caution ?
    No one will be inclined, perhaps, to dispute the Newto
nian theory of gravitation, yet there are phænomena which
it is difficult to conceive how it accounts for. Thus it would
seem a contradiction to the establislied principles of our great
philosopher, to suppose that a body divided into parts, how
ever minute, can possibly ascend in a fluid specifically lighter
than itself. A little acquaintance with the operations of che
mistry will show that this is a fact that occurs in the solution
of various solids, and that without any motion being com
municated to the vessel containing them; the solid becoming
diffused throughout the substance of the dissolving fluid, ana
appearing to overcome the natural tendency of bodies towards
the centre of the earth, and to have some new power of ascent
impressed on its particles.
    To conclude, then, it appears that we are entitled to con
sider caloric, in the present state of our knowledge, as a sub
stance sui generis, not because we can sensibly demonstrate
the truth of our opinion, but because it is the least excep
tionable theory of the two, and because the phænomenon of
heat admits from it an interpretation more simple and ob
vious, and more agreeable to the analogy of nature.                     P.
   * If  our correspondent had attended to this fact, that in the experiments
alluded to, the Count, with all the care and precaution he employed, had
not succeeded in insulating from the contact of caloric the bodies subjected
to friction, he would not have found them stand at all in the way of his
argument. Was not the apparatus wholly immersed in a bath of caloric—
the atmosphere ? — Edit.

presented   to the metallic   particles that he obtains a deter
minate quality of crude iron, experiment will enable him to
deduce, that in manufacturing the richest natures of iron his
produce from the ore will be more, by the extra quantity of
carbon necessary to constitute this quality, than when the in
ferior numbers of iron are produced.        In all cafes, therefore,
in making cast iron, considerable quantities of the coal be
come united with the iron, forming, by weight, a portion
comparatively great.
   From the usual processes hitherto employed in manufac
turing blistered steel, the positive quantity of carbon which
became united with the iron never became an object worthy
of the attention of the manufacturer. It was sufficient to him
that his bars possessed blisters sufficiently large and prominent
to assure him that his steel was sufficiently converted.        The
unerring test of practice through a long series of operations
confirmed the correctness of this deduction ; and it must
have appeared a matter of little importance to the formation
of steel, that its direct operation of principle should be deve
loped, or the laws which regulate its affinity in cementation.
   No additional fact was necessary to the production of cast
steel.   The simple fusion of bar steel, regulated by such cir
cumstances as practice, and the various uses to which this
steel is applied, was all that was necessary to be known ; the
affinity of iron for carbon, and the various proportions in
which it exists with the metal, forming the different qualities
of steel, here met with no elucidation.
   On the contrary, we still find that the union of iron and
charcoal to form steel, is a matter of doubtful opinion among
manufacturers, and the weight gained by its cementation
generally denied.
   It is only lately that a process has been brought into use
for making cast steel, which has for its basis or principle the
direct proportions of carbon necessary to form steel, illustra

   To investigate this subject with accuracy, it appeared to
me that a series of experiments, made by the fusion of bar
iron with well prepared charcoal of wood in vessels completely
air-tight, would be productive of the greatest nicety of re
sult.   With this, view, the proportions of iron and charcoal
recorded in the following experiments were each of them in
troduced into crucibles of Stourbridge clay while the clay
Vas yet moist.     The top was accurately closed upon the con
tents, and the crucibles set aside to dry for eight or ten days.
Previous to the introduction into the melting furnace they
were baked in a common annealing fire to bring them to an
ordinary red heat: from this furnace, while hot, they were
successively placed in the assay-furnace for reduction.
   The following are the details of these experiments : Grains.

close vessels thus prepared were subject to uncertainty, arising

and at epochas of very ditlant periods, and at the intervals of

the learning in fashion, or more generally suspected as dan
gerous ;   which, indeed,    italways is to the false and artificial
authority which assumes and takes the lead in the world.
    Itis   with pain that   I  have to notice several eminent ex^
amples of this melancholy truth in the course of my stating
the character and fate of the monk Roger Bacon, who               the    is
subject of this paper. .
    When Socrates came forward to the world, the powers of
the human mind, absorbed          in the false learning of Greece,
had been employed to propagate the sophistry and support the
sophists of the time, whose iystem and business were to keep
mankind from true knowledge            an avowed principle of sucfr
                                       by
ignorance as was incapable of attaining truth             the purport
                                                           ;
of which system was to hold men in servile obedience to
                                            a
authority, as those who had the command of that authority
should impose it. Socrates        inhis theology taught only thole
truths which had been, known to the antient philosophers of
 Greece, and which thev had brought from the east.              What
they aflected to conceal he taught openly,             far as went to
                                                      so
establish the knowledge of a moral Jyjhm connecting the                       di
vine and human nature.         Here he was original: this was
new truth brought forward to the world.              In this, as          it   is a
 truly said of him, he brought down truth from heaven, and
efiablilhed  it  on   amoral foundation on earth.
    As to his manner of teaching, he with great address, in
 accommodation to the learning of the time, professed to
commence in ignorance.            But whilst the sophists led, in
synthetic reasoning, from ignorance to       a   total incapacity in
 man for truth    ;  he, commencing his theorem from stated
                                                           ignorance,

    ignorance, proceeded                by
                                  analytic induclion to the eliciting
    of truth as the algebraists have since done, from theorem
                :                                                             a
    stated on an unknown quantity, bringing out the true one.
    He thus not only brought truth to light           reason, but
                                                             by         the        by
    very mode of his rtaloning taught the use, the extent, and
    the right of human reason.       This was sufficient to decide the
    fate which both the teacher and his doctrines experienced.
    His doctrines were despised, and attempts were made                 the        by
    wits of the time to ridicule his knowledge           was represented
                                                                :   it
    as evolved from the clouds*.        But, as truth will stand the
,   test of ridicule, nothing remained but to decide              authority   by
    that the truths which he taught were inadmisiible; and they
    wtre therefore interditlnd         sower: and Socrates himself
                                              y
    was prolecuted and condemned to death as                false teacher,
                                                                         a

                                   is
    of man, the doctrines which he taught, and the truths which
    he published, were perverted where received, and even                               by
    his disciples.    The homely simplicity of his doctrines was
    sophisticated and corrupted,          line of learning, to uses per
                                               in   a
    versive of their nature.
          will not here glance, although                 my mind's eye,
                                                            it

     the world to enlighten man, and to instruct him               his most   in
    essential duty and interest.
        Pursuing therefore the fate of Socrates, which            not irre    is
    lative to the matter of this paper,      shall proceed to state that

    matician, and particularly conversant in the analytic process
    of that science, and who followed the steps of induction
    marked out          by
                      Socrates, mixed so many mystic conceits and
     theories, that he sublimed and subtilized truth to                mere        a
    learned vision, such as the latter Platonists afterward taught.
        Aristotle, on the other hand,         distinguished
                                                        a       disciple of
     Plato, converted the knowledge of physics, both material and
    intellectual, into an artificial Jyjhm of axioms, data, and
    maxims, and formed thereon a logical frame of synthesis                              5
    which gave occasion to his immediate followers and to the
    Peripatetic school to found their learning on the authority of
    teaching, instead of being founded on truth led             experience   by
     to knowledge, to the disgrace of human intellect, and the
    perverfion of true philosophy.
      It   is lamentable to reflect how many theories and myste
    ries, divine as well as natural, sprang from this foul ground;
                             * Vide     the   Nubcs Ai.stophauis.
                                                                                   which,

 crates, in the spirit of truth, in the analytic line of true
 knowledge, endeavoured to state the Impedimenta scientiee,
 the Causas ignorantiœ, and to remove all the obstructions
 which {hut up the road to truth : he then, explaining by
 fact and example the Utilitas scientiarum, advanced, by an
 experimental investigation of nature, and by an analysis of
 truth, to his Rejiauratio humani inlelleSus, and his Injlauratio
Jcient'ue.
     Reasoning, however, above the scale of the learning of the
 age in which he lived, his doctrines were neither understood
 nor received ; and, where they could not he repressed by the
 learning of the time, they -were interdicted by the ruling au
 thority of it. Although the t,ruths which he discovered, and
 endeavoured to disclose to the world, were listened to by
 several men of knowledge, and some of them in power *, and
 though they were received even by the supreme t authority,
 held infallible; yet, by a Jin againfi the holy spirit of truth,
 they were unacknowledged, and suffered to languish in ob
 scurity. They, with the teacher, were delivered over to per
 secution ; truth was extinguished, and the discoverer and
 teacher imprisoned for the crimes of magic and heresy.
    Here again, on the stage of this world, was truth devoted
 to silence and darkness, and the discoverer and teacher of it
 thrown back into obscurity, and his doctrines lost in obliviun,
 except what ignorance rakes up lo memory in disgraceful
 tales of tradition.   The stream, therefore, of this original
 spring, whence the knowledge of latter times derives its source,
 ran, like the Rhone, concealed and unknown for three or
 four centuries ; whilst in the mean time various empiries
 in philosophy, various baseless theories, (amidst which the
 ingenious fables of Descartes more especially,) took the lead

 however, like the Rhone, emerged again to light on the face

veral gentlemen of the Royal Society, sent them to the se
cretary of that society, where they were read in 1675; an^
although the other ptrts were added about 1 2 years after ;
yet to avoid, as he lays, being engaged in disputes about
these matters, he delayed the printing and publishing of them,
to 1704; and would still have delayed, had not. the impor
tunity of some friends overcome the repression which he ex
perienced from the jealousy of some authoritative leaders."
Such is the invariable spirit and temper of man even in an,
enlightened age, and such is the unavoidable fate of those who
would enlighten and assist the knowledge of the world. Such,
 at least, were the feelings of this great and humble spirit;
 such was his conviction, that the age in which he first made
 his discoveries was neither willing to receive nor capable of
             them, to the purpose of truth, that the world might
    ave been deprived of them for ever, as in fact it is at this
 Eossessing
 moment of some discoveries which he had in view and in pur
 suit, but which he ceased to follow up, and has suggested
 only in queries. What a loss to mankind that these sug
 gestions, except in some particular instances, have not been
 pursued ! For, whatever and howsoever great the discoveries
 which have been brought forward by the new philosophic
 chemists may be, yet these important suggestions would, as
  they have done in some instances where they have been taken
  up, have led to great and interesting philosophic facts hardly
  at present conceivable.
      It was from the fame opinion of the temper and want of
 qualification in that age, perhaps also from an oppression of
  spirit which he felt, that on another occasion, when con
  sulted by Dr. Bentley, at the time of his being appointed
  to preach the Boyle's lectures, Sir Isaac says in his letter,
  " There is yet another argument in proof of the Deity, which
  I  take to be a very strong one; but until the principles on
  which it is grounded are better received, I think it more ad-
  viseablc to let it sleep." Such has ever been the fate of know
  ledge, both to the discoverers and to truth itself, on its first
                                                      appearance,

Shall we then wonder at the fate which this true and real
philosopher, the monk Roger Bacon, experienced in an ig
 norant, superstitious, and servilely debased age?
    To point out the real merit and character os this wonderful
 man, which is the purport of this paper, I (hall now pro
 ceed to a review and general analysis of his doctrines as stated
i n his Opus Majus.
    I trust it will be found to be an amazing extensive plan,
 founded in experience of nature and on the analysis of truth j

church, and of treason against the state, might be imputed,
and which was the real ground of his persecution and im

   II. These four points he examines, explains, and discusses
specially and at full length under their several heads.    The
ground   thus  cleared, and the foundations thus  laid, he pro
ceeds in the second part in analysing grammar to its ele
ments wherein he not only goes to the art of language, but
           ;
to the powers and operations of the mind,                    by
                                                 an inquisition
into the human understanding, as Mr. Locke, and Mr. Harris
in his Hermes did afterward.
   Then, passing      the commonly received mode of reason
                               by
ing, as     moves in the trammels of logic, which this great
               it
original states to be not only perversive, but at best mere           a
left-handed hold      which we take truths already discovered
                               by                                            ;

by which we lock them up in an artificial system, and which
is of no use or aid in the pursuit and the discovery and in
vention of truth ; he then treats of the virtue, power, and use
of mathematics, properly so called, both analytic in the in
vestigation   of truth, and synthetic in conducting it to prac
tical science.
    4. By this conductor he goes first through the investiga
tion, and next through the didactive explanation and proof
of the powers and operations of nature, by the principles of
the laws of motion, attraction, gravity.          Guided by these
principles he proceeds to the laws of vision, perspective, and
optics in general ; and to the laws by which light is acted
 upon. And here he goes to the mechanical and instrumental,
so as to explain the practical part, bringing forward many
improved uses and applications leading to new discoveries.
    5. He proceeds hence to astronomy, in an investigation of
the phænomena of the heavenly bodies. In this part some
 remains of astrological prejudices not yet eradicated obstruct
 his institute.
    6. The heads above stated take up five parts out of six into
 which his Opus Majus is divided. He then, in the Ji\tb
part, comes to the main ground and true basis on which the
 Inftauratio scientia is founded and built up, which is experi
 mental induction. This he explains in detail, and illustrates
 by example ; recurring again and again to the phænomena
 of nature terrestrial and celestial : — * Duo sunt modi cognos-
 cendi, scilicet, per argumentum et experimentum.           Argu-
 mentum concludit, et facit concludere quæstionem ; fed non.

    Whoever, divested 01 preoccupation and prejudice as they
 spring from the Consuetudinis      fdiuturnitas, and the fascina
 tion of received fashion in thinking, reads this great work,
with comparative    reference to the lnjlauratio fcientiarum of
the second Bacon, the lord St. Albans, will find both works
similarly grounded, and similarly conducted, as to the method
and form; both alike built up on an institute of induction
 byexperimental science; both in the execution pursuing the
same line to the same point      and must conclude either, ac
                              "

cording  to the old proverb,    that great wits jump;" or that

                                                                     first,

334                On the Fate and CbaraEler
first, had read and received a reflected ray of illumination from
the works of the first Bacon, our philosopher.
    These works of the monk had been buried, amidst the ma
nuscripts of such learning as is never read, for three or four
hundred years before the time in which the lord St. Albans
wrote; and continued in the fame state for near a century
after, to 1733, when they were published by the learned
editor Dr. Jebb ; yet they might not have escaped the scru
tinizing, industrious, inquisitive genius and informed studies
of the second great philosopher. But let me here repeat,
that whatever cause or chance first wrought this second great
          into operation, he was equally an original as the first,
  'or, whoever considers the process of the operations of intel
fenius
lect, and the origin and progress of knowledge, will find it
difficult, if not impossible, to mark what that spring, internal
or external, is which first becomes a cause from a coincidence
of ideas that gives course to it.
    As it hath become an almost generally received opinion,
that the instauration of true philosophy in the present age
derives its source primarily and solely from Bacon the lord
St. Albans, I cannot but think it just in this paper to en
deavour to restore to the Jtrjl original that portion of merit
which is due to him ; and fairly to appreciate the former,
without derogating from the latter : and to recommend to
this society to trace back the origin of their philosophy to a
more remote source, arising within the bounds of the county
in which this society is established * ; from a spring which,
however illaudatus, unhonoured, and almost lost in anti
quity, will always be a peculiar honour to this county, as
generally so, in every extent and degree, to the British nation
at large.     ,
    Almost all societies, originally from superstition, but since
 from the habit of custom, have adopted some supposed patron
taint.     Instead of adopting a patron, let this society avow as
 their pattern the philosopher monk.        Though no faint, it
 would be an honour to any philosophic society to adopt his
principles, and to follow his example.              .
    1 ft, To adopt his principles     by an independent spirit of
 philosophizing, which will not be repressed or kept down by
 the authority of any name howsoever great        ;will not be re
 strained within the bounds of any society or sect howsoever
 respectable;    will not submit to any dominant lead, but, with
 out' opposition or faction against others, will unabated follow
 the steps of truth with undeviating investigation       j   by
                                                            an ar-

   Having thus adopted his principles, let us follow bis ex
ample also in the mode of philosophizing; tst, By a patient
induction and cautious combination of particulars, without
being hasty to form them into systems on the first flattering
semblance of discovery : 2d, That we do not suborn assumed
experiments to bear false witness to supposed facts; but to
take more merit from the truth discovered than from the dis
covery ; and to eradicate, if it be possible, all vanity from the
heart, et veritatem Jine dote quterere.
   Lastly, It will not be beyond the scope of this paper, and,
I would hope, not offensive to this learned society, to suggest,
whether amongst their other learned studies and philosophical
researches there may not be many a commenced, though in
terrupted, institute of experiments ; many a glimpse of dis
covery not yet brought out to open day in the works of this
great original philosopher, well worth their attention for exa
mination at least : yet
                    Non jurare in vcrba magiitri.
  I  shall not here take notice of the discovery of lenses, nor
of their first uses in magnifying objects, and particularly
as reading-glasses ; because the refraction and reflection of
light, and of the rays of the fun, by lense9 and mirrors,
were known to the antients *, though I do not meet with
any mention of their use to aid in redding.      But I believe
the antients wrote in such uncials as suited the powers of
the eye without this aid.      Another reason why I do not
take notice of this as a discovery to be imputed to Bacon             is,
           * Vide   Scholitst to the Nuoei   of Aristophanes.
                                                                .   that

 tion, made to burn at a great distance : yet he withholds
 himself from explaining this use; and does not in any part
 mention its explosion, as applied by the instrumentality of
 tubes to a projectile force that was to throw the miflile wea
 pons of cogles or balls.   Which application of it renders it
 specifically gunpowder.     His words are: " In omnem di-
 stantiam, quam volumus, possumus artificialiter componere
 tgnem comburentem ex fale-petra et aliis." What these other
 articles are he mentions in another part of his works, namely,
sulphur and charcoal.
    I cannot restrain myself from mentioning the idle tradi
 tional story of friar Bacon's brazen head, which was to speak
 and announce time, because I think it founded in a real
 though mistaken fact,       From considering what one may
 elicit out of /the nonsense of      it,
                                       Ihave persuaded myself that
it  was an experiment in horology, and the model of clock       a
 measuring time     by  the oscillation of       pendulum, and by
                                                    a
 various movements in the face of this head, (as            actually
                                                           is
 the existing fact in the clock at Bade,) marking the divisions
 of time, together with    a  mechanism that should announce
 by  sound those divisions, which,         allusion to the face and
                                               in
 bead, was called speaking similar to the crowing os the cock
                            ;
 on the clock at Strasbourg, or to the cuckoo on the wooden
 clocks which the Germans fell about our streets.
    There remains still to be mentioned, incontestably to his
 unrivalled honour, that he was the first discoverer of the
 error of measuring time        by   false period of the year
                                     a                          and

fate of this proposal to be neglected ; whilst the imperfect
Gregorian reckoning, which it hath been found necessary
since to correct, was adopted.        I will close this paper with a
translation of the words of Dr. Jebb, the learned editor of the
Opus Majus, as they stand in his preface : — " The proposal
made by Bacon to the pope Clement was one of the noblest
efforts of human industry : considered in all the circumstances
under which it was framed and composed, it is one of the
most stupendous instances of the force of human genius which
hath been recorded ; and will do honour to our learned coun
tryman as long as the fun and moon endure."
LVII.     Observations  nvhicb   seem   to prove the Necesjity os ob
  serving and meditating a long Time before any decisive Opi
   nion is formed in Philosophy in general, and particularly in
   regard to the Cause of Earthquakes. By Courejolles*.
H<    LOWEVER painful may be the researches necessary for
discovering the causes which Nature employs in her opera
tions, we must observe with great attention and indefatigable
assiduity in order to collect those facts which are properest for
conducting us to the attainment of this object.            It does not
belong to men to invent causes ; they exist in nature, and it
is their business to discover them.
   If  in the exact sciences the precision of a result escapes us,
and if we cannot extend our conception but to that term
where incommensurability of dimensions stops calculation,
how can the creators of systems pretend to the privilege of
penetrating to the bottom of the abysses where Nature has
concealed her primitive causes ? Nothing then but experi
ence, observation, and comparison, guided by geometrical
method, can conduct us with wisdom in our researches.
   Sensible of this truth, I have thought it my duty to follow
this progress in my observations on every thing that may re
late to the cause of earthquakes; for it would be imprudent
to assign one before a variety of facts are established.          This
method is the more certain, as Nature often spontaneoufly
unveils herself: but a long time is necessary to collect good
observations : and we ought never to be precipitate in mak
ing them appear, because in the study of the sciences there
is an age at which the passions blind us by a too ardent desire

 of acquiring an early reputation ; and, when  we have obtained
 it in that manner, too great a degree of       self-love obliges
 us to maintain our errors, and to cover them with darkness,
 that we may preserve them from the attacks of truth.        From
 this weakness of the human mind, we may judge how dan
 gerous we become to those desirous of being instructed, when,
 under the shield of a reputation, we employ every means in
 our power to perpetuate an erroneous opinion.         Men would
 be much happier than they are, if those whose documents
 they follow had proceeded only step by step in their re
 searches, and had been able to free themselves from those
 transports of pride which they improperly confound with
 that kind of self-love which conducts to good. They ought
 to have the courage to retract their errors ; but unfortunately
 we have no school to teach us to employ a few words so dif
 ficult to be pronounced — " I am in the wrong."
    The habit of reflecting on, and comparing for a long time,
 a great number of facts respecting earthquakes, might em
 bolden me to pronounce in regard to the manner in which
 subterranean matters inflame, either by the decomposition of
water and pyrites, or by other causes, neither the nature nor
movement of which is perceived.        I, however, acknowledge
my insufficiency to be such, that I dare not venture to decide
on the real cause of earthquakes. Had I listened only to the
voice of self-love, I should soon have fabricated a system ;
but I cannot do better than submit my remarks to the exa
mination of the most acute philosophers, who, perhaps, will
succeed much better than I could have done.          I shall there
fore give an extract from a verv extensive work which I com-
posed on earthquakes, but which having been lost by the
burning of Cape Francois, I can only mention the principal
observations, which may serve as data to those employed in
similar researches.
    1. Earthquakes are more strongly felt in all parts which
front the west, than in those which have a different situation.
    2. The earthquakes felt in districts of great extent which
face the north have never occasioned shocks sufficiently strong
to throw down houses.
    3. Districts which face the south have frequently experi
enced those violent shocks which occasion great damage; but
this situation is less dangerous than that of districts which
front the west.
    4. Districts which look towards the east are sometimes
subject to slight earthquakes.
    5. Large islands, such as Madagascar, Borneo, Ceylon,
Java, Celebes, the Moluccas, the Philippines, the Japan
            5                                                  M«»

                  On the Cause   of Earthquakes.               339
ides) the Great Antilles, and all the other extensive islands
of the globe, experience earthquakes in the fame manner as
continents ; that is to fay, with more violence in the districts
which front the west and the south, than in thole which look
towards any other quarter.
    6. Small islands, in consequence of their small extent, feel
the effects of earthquakes almost in an equal manner through
out all their parts : it is observed, in particular, that the most
violent shocks are always towards the west and south.
    7. Parts of the earth confined between two seas, as the
isthmuses of Porto Bello, Suez, and several others, experi
ence the effects of earthquakes on the two opposite sides.
    8. In a great extent of coast which looks towards the
north, when changes of direction occur so as to look towards
the west, as that ofthe northern part of Africa towards Oran,
or as that of the gulph of Marecaybo, earthquakes are accom
panied with peculiarities analogous to their position ; that is
to fay, those parts of the coasts which look towards the west
are subject to very violent earthquakes.
    9. Small islands lying to the west or south of continents,
or of other islands much larger, experience very violent
shocks. Several islands which were in this situation have
disappeared in consequence of violent earthquakes, by which
they were swallowed up in the sea.
    10. Among the coasts which face the west or the south,
there are places where, earthquakes are felt with more violence
than in others : it is almost always in these places that the
most violent sliocks are repeated.
    11. Great earthquakes are almost always preceded and fol
lowed, some time before and after, by small shocks.
    12. Two earthquakes have often taken place on the fame
day at two places at a considerable distance, and separated
from each other by sea or by intermediate lands which have
not experienced the least shock.
    13. Great earthquakes almost always take place after long
rains.
    14. Earthquakes have often been followed by malignant
 fevers and epidemical diseases.
    15. Earthquakes are sometimes       preceded or followed by
 hurricanes.      .
    16. We had n very violent hurricane at Cape Franijois
 about an hour before the famous earthquake on the 3d of
June 1770.      This hurricane came from the mountain called       ,
 La Charbonieie, more than 40 leagues distant from the Cape.
 The earthquake overturned this mountain, so that many of

lines : in general, it fell only two inches during the greatest
variations.
   18. The storm experienced throughout the whole island of
St. Domingo in 1788, proceeded alto from the mountain De
la Charboniere. This I ascertained in the following manner:
A few days after the storm, having made a tour through the
island on a particular mission, I saw in every place where           I
passed that the trees overturned by the hurricane were lying
in the direction of radii proceeding from the summit of the
mountain to the different places which I visited, though al
most all distant from its base 15, 20, and 30 leagues.
   As certain winds occasion rain, while others occasion
drought,      will be necessary that
                it'                      Ishould mention their
meteorological effects, to be able to judge of the influence
which they have on earthquakes and volcanoes.
    19.
           Itwell known that when two contiguous parts of
                is
the atmosphere are of different densities, the densest part,
which consequently has the greatest elasticity, moves to
 wards that which has the less, forming          current of air,
                                                 a
which extends towards the fide where there          the least re
                                                     is
sistance.
     20.    The current of the trade winds at sea follows the
course      of the fun but ; changes its direction near islands
                                it
and continents.
    21. The eastern part of the island of St. Domingo receives
the trade wind without changing its direction.
    22. The whole north coast of the fame ifland changes the
direction of the trade wind; and, instead of suffering         to
                                                                it
continue its natural course to the west, attracts     it,
                                                      and makes
it incline towards the land, to form compound current pro
                                         a
ceeding from north-east to south-west.
    23. The western part, from Port a. Piment to Port au
Prince, attracts the air of the west towards the east, in       a   di
rection altogether contrary to the trade wind, and to that of
the eastern part, or of Samana.
    24. The southern part of the same island attracts the trade
wind, and makes         change its natural direction from east to
                           it
west, to form     current ot air proceeding from south-east to
                      a
north-west.
    25. All changes which take place in regard to the current
of the trade winds arise, in all probability, from the fun dart
ing his rays        the solid parts of the island, which imbibe
                      in
them in the ratio of their densities, and even of their colours.

sun-set to 9, 10, or     at night.   After which a calm takes
place for some moments ; the land wind then prevails during
the whole night, in consequence of the condensation of the
vapours of the atmosphere, which being cooled, and acquir
ing gravity by the absence of the sun, in their descent expel
the ambient air, which they press on all sides from the centre
towards the circumference, that is to fay, from the interior
of the island towards the sea : this is what is called the land
breeze.
    39. Of all the breezes here mentioned, the east and north
winds are more frequent in the countries of the torrid zone
than those of the west and south, except in the districts men
tioned in the 23d and 34th observations.
    30. The mountains form so many dikes that oppose the
course of the clouds which are there accumulated, and, be
ing condensed, fall down in rain on the sides and at the bot
tom of the mountains.
    31. The plains on the    side where the clouds are accumu
lated are fertile, and those on the opposite side are dry. These
mountains therefore divide these countries into two different
 climates.
    3a. Earthquakes are much more frequent in arid countries
than in districts watered by rain; because, in all probability,
the vapours of the interior part of the country are there col
lected, and proceed thither more than to those where the rains
render the earth compact.
    33. The faces
                    of mountains which look towards the north
 and the east, are more cooled by the rains than those which
 look fowards the south and west.
    34. In the Spanish plains, situated in the centre of Saint
 Domingo, there are several insulated mountains, which, nou
 withstanding their small extent, exhibit the different temper
 ratures indicated around their sides by {hades of verdure ana-
                               Y3                          logou9

    36. The mountains of arid countries, being composed of
a great deal of light earth, are rounded at the summits ; they
nave in general a more gentle declivity than those of rainy
countries, and, when too rapid, fragments of them crumble
dovvnr the trees which grow on these mountains produce
very hard timber, and scarcely any creeping plants are found
near them.
    37. The earth of mountains watered by rains being com
pact, as observed in the 35th observation, does not permit
the rain water to penetrate them j it trickles down the sur
face, and flows into the ravines, at the fame time that it falls
from the heavens.
    38. The mountains in arid countries are in general co
vered with calcareous earth or chalk, and the fragments of
other tender stones mixed with the powder of dried vegetables,
which altogether form a spongy light earth. This earth is
easily penetrated by rain water, and it retains it in the bosom
of the mountains or of the eminences by which they are sur
rounded.        This water escapes merely by a flow filtration,
which produces continual springs that maintain the streams
in the ravines; and these, in their turn, supply the rivers that
fall into the sea.      It is for this reason that those parts of St.
Domingo towards the west have more ravines and running
streams than the northern and eastern parts of the island.
The cafe is the fame in the Great Antilles.
    39. The calcareous stones found on the mountains of the
west part of St. Domingo exhibit the empty nests of the po
lypes by which they were formed.              These fossils are found in
all the mountains of St. Marc and the Gonaives in such
abundance, that when broken with a large hammer it is
more difficult to find any without the impression of a madre
pore than those from which it is effaced *,
                                                                    40. In
    *  To  ascertain with certainty whether these fossils have heen left in
consequence of the surlace of the sea becoming lower,     I caused a well ta
 be  dug at the bottom of a rock on a plantation which I had opposite to the
 Cape Town, in order to erect there a machine 1 had constructed at a great
                                                                    expense,

of   the place where they might manifest themselves.
    44. The volcanoes of Sicily, according to several observa
tions made on different eruptions, seem to be only ramifica
tions of Vesuvius situated to, the north-east of Ætna, Lipari,
and the other spiracles in the western part of the kingdom of
Naples.
    45. There are only two or three volcanoes in all those
parts of the globe which are known, that incline towards the
south-east : they are those of the island of Bourbon and of
Kamtschatka.
    46. In no part of the known world is there a volcano in a
situation that looks towards the north.
    47. Of the great number of volcanoes found in situations
looking to the west, there are 42 in the course of 400 leagues
expense, that posterity might know it in a positive manner; but, being in
haste to set out for France, in consequence of my being appointed a de
puty of the colony, and as my constituents pretended that the assembly of
the states-general would be ended before my arrival if s did not speedily
depart, I was obliged to leave this machiie in May 1789, without being
able to finish it.  It consisted chiefly of various movements which turned
four large copper cylinders, each six feet in height, with their floats and
other apparatus, according to the form of my meteorographs, in order to
mark the height of the tides each day, every month, and every lunar year
for a century.
   The rising and falling of the sea was to make the water enter and flow
out by a canal a foot in breadth : a small aperture of six lines only in dia
meter placed at the bottom of the well was to receive the water of this
canal so as to suffer it to rise and fall only in a very gentle manner.    A
large float of copper hermetically sealed was to serve as a moving power
to wind up this clock each tide by means of a kind of scapement.
   But unfortunately at the time the Cape was burnt my house was plun
dered, and all the copper, iron, and steel work of this machine were car
ried away ; so that I have been told no vestiges of it are left.     A large
chest full of manuscripts, the fruit of thirty years labour in th* arts and
sciences, useful to the colony, soared the same fate.

in   the Cordilleras,   which  extend    along the South  sea frerrt
Chili   to Panama.
    48. There are reckoned to be 30 or 35 volcanoes on the
coast of New Spain which looks towards the south-west on
the fide of the Pacific ocean.
    49. The volcanoes situated on lakes or deep gulphs, and
which    have a narrow mouth, manifest themselves sometimes
differently.    That of the lake of Nicaragua is situated on an
island to the east of the isthmus which separates that lake
from the South sea, or to the north-west of the other parts
of the continent.
    50. Volcanoes are more violent after long and heavy rains,
than after and during the time of drought.
    51. When rain falls in an equal quantity on all the parts
of a mountain, that which falls on the summit must naturally
run down and penetrate very little into the earth ; while the
fides receive not only that of the heavens, but that also which
comes from the summit.
    52. The sides of a mountain become plane in proportion
as they become lower, and to their distance from the summit.
    53. The lowest parts of the sides of a mountain must ne
cessarily imbibe more water than the higher parts.              The
quantity imbibed must be greater as the inclination of the
fides decreases in approaching the base.
    54. In the interior part of steep mountains there must be
places to which the water cannot penetrate.          These places,
111 all probability,   are those which approach nearest to the
vertical line, proceeding from the summit and terminating
perpendicularly towards the middle of the base.
    55. If the filtration of rain water through the earth on the
fides of mountains stops up the pores, and if the subterranean
vapours do not find room to escape through these sides, they
must proceed towards those pans which approach the ver
tical line drawn from the summit, which is the place where
they can find a passage by soaking through the pores of the
dry earth which must be there found.
     56. If gas and subterranean     fires are thrown towards the
 axis of the mountain by the intermission of waters which
 stop up their other passages, the elasticity of these fluids ac
 cumulated at the centre must necessarily increase.      It appears
 that, from this observation, we may deduce the reason why
 volcanoes often break out after long continued rains.
     57. Whether it be the decomposition of water, or any other
 cause, that makes the fire of volcanoes be disengaged, this
 fire must necessarily, as already said, pursue that route where

                      On the Cause os Earthquakes,                    345
 it finds the least resistance to its free passage. It appears,
  then, that this route must be that where the waters have not
  stopped up the pores of the earth.          It is for this reason, pro
  bably, that volcanoes manifest          themselves   at the summits of
  mountains.
      58. The crevices of volcanic mountains incline oftener
  from their centre towards the west or the south than towards
  the other sides.       It is always towards those parts that volca
  noes throw out their lava.             The reason of this seems to be
  explained by     the  31st, 32d, 23d, 34th, 35th, and 36th ob
  servations, and in particular by the 37th and 38th.
      59. The most violent volcanoes almost always manifest
  themselves in the highest mountains.
      60. It would appear that the ice on the summits of these
  mountains ought to secure the earth found there from being
  penetrated by the snow water which the temperature of the
, air may sometimes           dissolve ; and, as this temperature acts
  only    on the  surface   of the snow, the ice below ought to throw
  off that which is melted towards the sides where the declivity-
  is, and by these means prevent the water from penetrating
   the earth of the summit to moisten that at the centre of the
   mountain.
      61 . Volcanic mountains which are not very high, or which
   are not situated agreeably to the general position to which
   subterranean     fires seem to proceed,        have in general only
   weak volcanoes, which often in the end become extinct.
      62. Many of the extinguished craters have become lakes,
   or reservoirs of rain water, at the summit of mountains;
   springs commonly manifest themselves around their sides,
   and serve to fertilize the lands at their bottom.
      63. Ilistorv makes mention of many lakes which have
   been formed by mountains being swallowed up : all countries
   subject to earthquakes have a great many of them.
      64. The earth has been seen to swell up so as almost to
   form a hemispherical mountain, and to burst suddenly, with
   a horrid explosion, and leave nothing but a lake in the place.
       65. Many islands have emerged from the sea : some of
   these have existed for a long time, others have gradually dis
   appeared ; and some, in consequence os a continual undula
   tion, occasioned by subterranean sire, have disappeared after
    being slowly consumed.
       It is here proper to observe, that all these events take place
    in continents or islands the positions of which are analogous
    to those mentioned in the 1st, 3d, and 9th observations.
       Though this memoir is only a very sliort extract from a
    manuscript lost during the troubles or the Cape,             I think it

LVTII.      Observations on an Optical Phenomenon produced by
    Moon-light in the Vapours of the Atmosphere. By Professor
    Wrede*.
A.lBOUT            fifteen minutes past ten at night on the 14th of
December 1800, 1 observed above the horizon of Joachims-
thal, in the Ukermark, a very singular kind of reflection of
the rays of the moon's light, and such as I had never before
observed.       The temperature of the air, in consequence of a
thaw, was extremely moderate, and towards the south and
west the sky was perfectly serene, so that stars from the first
to the third magnitude, notwithstanding the great splendour
of the moon's light, could be clearly distinguished on the blue
ground of the atmosphere.                Towards the east and north,
however, it had a milk white colour, and there appeared
near the horizon in the north-east quarter a few streaked
clouds, which the common people generally consider as an
indication of wind. But these as well as the other cloudy
parts were so transparent that several of the circumpolar stars,
such as the Great and Less Bear,Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, could
fee observed.         The lower parts of the atmosphere, as well as
those strata in which the above clouds floated, appeared on
the first view to be entirely at rest. The moon seemed to be
nearly in the west-south-west quarter, and was so bright that
the spots of her illuminated fide could be easily distinguished.
In regard to her astronomical position she was near the star w
in the eastern band of the Fish, a little to the west of Mars,
and much further from Jupiter.                 In this position she was
surrounded by two very eccentric rings, the smaller of which,
being concentric, had the form of an ellipse; but the larger
was circular, as represented in the annexed engraving,
 (Plate VIII.) — The principal axis of the ellipsis lay south
and north, and the conjugate axis east and west.                       It was
intersected in the former direction by the eccentric circle,

Fifli. The ellipse extended, according to its greater diameter,
from the star © to the northern arm of Andromeda, to the
star t in the Whale, and then ran east above the tail of Aries,
so  that Mars was included by it near      J  of that constellation :
on the west fide it extended nearly to the equinoctial colure ;
on the southern and northern edges the ellipsis appeared to
be double, and sometimes triple.         There were seen here pale
shining rings in pairs, one pair of which had a greater trans
verse axis, and the other a smaller, than the principal ellipsis.
The latter was the cafe, in particular, towards the end of the
phænomenon. It sometimes appeared as if the two exterior
rings formed a particular ellipsis, which was concentric with
the principal one, but which had a smaller conjugate axis,
 and intersected the bright, luminous, elliptical ring in four
places.     Where the latter was touched by the circular ring
there appeared two striking paraselena, the northern one of
which, about eleven o'clock, exhibited a few faint prismatic
 colours ; but the southern one did not disperse the light in the
same manner, only that at its circumference it had a some
 what yellowish white appearance. The points where the
 false ellipsis intersected the large circular ring, did not exhibit
 the smallest appearance of prismatic refraction.        The proper
 elliptical ring from the moon towards the north-west was
 very ill defined, and scarcely uninterrupted; and this was
 the cafe also with the large ring towards the neighbourhood
 of the Unicorn, where there were fewer vapours, and where
 the sky towards the horizon was perfectly serene.          In other
 respects, both rings appeared very distinct, and of a white co
 lour; but this character was lost by the large one within the
 ellipsis, and the nearer it approached the moon, which over
 powered and obscured it by her splendour.            At this place,
 also, its thickness appeared to be as great as in the neighbour
                                                                 hood

  348           Optical Pbanonunon      by Moon-ligbt
 hood of the Unicorn : in other places it was quite uniform.
 The elliptical ring towards the east exhibited a very white and
 thicker part, which became deranged, and no longer coincided
 with the ellipse the nearer the phænomenon approached to
 its end. This happened a few minutes past eleven o'clock,
 after both the rings had lost their colour, and when the moon
 began to be surrounded by a yellow nimbus. At twenty mi
 nutes past eleven both the circle and ellipse had disappeared;
 but the nimbus around the moon had so increased, that, ac
 cording to the eye, it was equal to six diameters of the moon,
 or about three degrees. The vapours in the atmosphere were
 at this time no longer distributed in an uniform manner, but
 thrown together in masses of different densities, which formed
 Tegular clouds,and in which some motion was observed. Nei
 ther snow nor rain, however, followed, but the weather as well
 as the temperature     of the atmosphere continued the same.
 About eleven o'clock the following evening a little cold rain
 fell ; but the drops were exceedingly fine, and it did not long
 continue.'
    Having finished the description of this phænomenon, it
 might naturally be expected that I sliould give some explana
 tion of the causes which produced it; but I have not suffi
 cient confidence in my own abilities to undertake so difficult
 a task.    As far as can be deduced from the principles of
 optics and the doctrine of light, it may be ascribed to some
 insulated clouds of different thickness and density, or to se
 veral strata of clouds lying near and above each other. The
 phænomenon of the paraielena, where both rings apparently
 intersected each other, gives us reason to conjecture that they
 actually cut each other j and that therefore we may admit
 as the cause the first case, that is to fay, one single stratum of
 clouds of unequal thickness and density. It is not improbable
 that, in regard to the elliptical ring, the case was the fame as
 with the lenticular elevations in common window glass,
 which distort objects, extend them in length, and give to
 round things an elliptical form.        But, in my opinion, it is
 more difficult to explain why the larger ring was perfectly
 circular, and appeared so eccentric ; why the image of the
 moon lay at the end of the radius in the periphery.            It is
 very probable, as has been already remarked by various ob
 servers, that during this phænomenon there were in the thick
 vapours of the atmosphere several hollow cones or funnels
 which, bordering on the basis of the image, formed several
 rings; for the latter occasioned, in the places of intersection,
 an appearance of the prismatic colours.          Should this con
jecture be agreeable to truth, the higher geometry, and par-
             5                                              ticularly

had the same stratum of clouds over him, and beheld the
moon through it ; and it is probable that the phænomenon
might have remained unnoticed had the observer been a
mile towards one side from the position in which he then
stood. We may admit, not without reason, that all such
circles with which the fun and moon are sometimes sur
rounded are not at a very considerable distance from the sur
face of the earth, and therefore are not visible in a greater
extent than 40 or 50 miles.      If the highest clouds over the
sea can be seen only at the distance of about 20 geographical
miles above the horizon, how much more must a phæno
menon which takes place in far lower districts of the atmo
sphere escape the notice of different observers whose positions
are at a great distance from each other, and particularly
when its visibility depends on the angle under which an object
must be viewed to observe that peculiar image which is pro
duced ! We never sec the rainbow in a cloud, or rather in
the falling drops of rain, when the fun is either too high or
too low.     In the high Alps of Swifferland it sometimes hap
 pens, that instead of a bow there is seen a complete circle of
 the prismatic colours in the drops precipitated from the at
 mosphere.     In the same manner, the visibility of various
 other phænomena in the atmosphere depends on the point
of fight which is favourable for the observation. We there
 fore ought not to assert that such or such phænomena seldom
 occur ; we ought rather to say that they have been seen by
 individual observers, and in particular geographical points of
sight.
    I shall embrace this opportunity of making some observa
tions on an assertion which appeared in one of the public,
journals of lust year. Speaking of a rainbow produced by
 moonlight, which was observed on the 5th of September 1800
 from the observatory of Gottingen, the account concluded
                                                           with

356               Vegetable Principle contained in Coffeet
with asserting that this very rare phænomenon had been ob
served since the period of Aristotle only eleven times, and in
Germany only once, by Weidler, in 1719. I can, however^
produce two instances of a lunar rainbow seen in Germany.
In the year 1799 or 1798 I observed in Pomerania, at a vil
lage in the neighbourhood of Wollin, a rainbow of this kind,
even though the moon was not full.         If my memory does
not fail me, it was then a mild harvest evening, and at most
only eight o'clock. The sky was pretty clear, and the moon
was about 30 or 40 degrees above the horizon towards the east.
Towards the west I observed a cloud at about the same height,
and in this was seen the rainbow, the colours of which were
exceedingly lively.   Its ends only were pale, and very faint.
It was larger than a quadrant, but did not form a complete
semi-circle.    The liveliness of the colours did not long con
tinue after it was first observed ; for a west wind drove the
cloud before      and  it, small sliower fell.

I    N   a      calculated to confine the vapour of water,
              vessel                                                             I
heated     considerable portion of that liquid upon about

of the qualities of which was well assured.

             Vegetable  Principle  contained  in Coffee.       351
fiorating dish, at a gentle heat.     By this  means I obtained  a
small quantity of a clear yellow residuum like the most trans
parent horn, and of the consistence of honey. This residuum
did not deliquesce, or seem to be. subject to change, by expo
sure to the atmosphere.        It was soluble in alcohol. It did
not manifest either acid or alkaline properties. By some ex
periments I perceived it to be a substance differing essentially
from all the vegetable principles with which I was acquainted;
and, finding that I could obtain it pure by the method which
Proust used to procure tannin, I proceeded in the following
manner :
    I poured a solution of muriate of tin into some water which
had been made to boil upon coffee, and obtained a precipi
tate, which I collected upon a silter, and washed.          I then
put it into water, and caused a current of sulphuretted hydro
gen gas to pass slowly through the liquor. By this process the
oxide of tin combined with the sulphuretted hydrogen gas ; and
the substance originally contained in the coffee, but which,
as I (hall immediately (how, had combined with the metallic
oxide, was disengaged, and remained in the liquor j while
 the hydrogenized sulphuret of tin was precipitated.       It then
 remained only to evaporate the liquor to obtain the vegetable
 principle.   In this state it exhibited nearly the fame appear
 ance as before it had been combined with the oxide of tin ;
but seemed of a lighter colour, and more clear and trans
parent; being freed, as       I  suppose, from all extractive or
 other matter.
    Imagining it now to be sufficiently pure, I dissolved it in
 a very small proportion of water, and examined it chemically.
    The solution was of a bright horn colour, and had a bitter
 taste, though not unpleasant.      It was neither acid nor alka
 line.
    Solutions of potash, of soda, or of ammonia, poured into
 the liquor, changed its colour to a bright garnet red.
    Nitric acid produced a similar effect.
    Very concentrate solutions of the alkaline carbonates did
 not cause a precipitate, as in a solution of tannin.
    Sulphuric acid became of a dirty brown colour with the
 solution ; but no other change was apparent.
    With muriatic, phosphoric, and the vegetable acids, there
 was no change, even of colour.
    With muriate of gold, of platina, of copper, there was
 not any change, but what would naturally result from a
 mixture os the colours of both liquors.
    With any solution of iron, in which there was not excess
                                                                 of

   Lime water did not     cause any precipitate      in this liquor,
nor did strontia water. Barytes water gave a fawn-coloured
precipitate.    With lime water, tannin gave a blueifh green
precipitate ; and nearly the fame with strontia water, as also
with barytes water.
   A   solution os' animal gelatine did not give any precipitate
with this vegetable principle. The effect of tannin upon
gelatine is well known.
   By the above experiments it appears that this principle
bears sufficient characters to distinguish it from tannin, or
any other vegetable principle with which we are acquainted.
The only property which it possesses in common with tannin,
is its affinity for oxide of tin ; while it is clearly distinct from
tannin in every other respect.
   It is evident that coffee before it is roasted does not con
tain tannin. A solution of gelatine poured into a decoction
of roasted coffee, gives, however, an immediate precipitate;
and this precipitate is the combination of tannin with gela
tine. Messrs. Proust, Seguin, and Davy, have observed that
heat develops the tanning principle in many vegetables.            In
a commercial point of view, it would be essential to examine
whether those vegetables are not such as, before being heated,
contain this new principle. Although I did not perceive
that the principle, when insulated from the entire vegetable,
was converted by heat into tannin, yet the presence of the
other component parts of the vegetable may influence the
distribution of elements in such a manner as to produce com
binations different from what the separate principles would
afford.
   I have not had an opportunity to look for this new prin
ciple in other vegetables.

medals, of which the bishop was exceedingly fond.            Young
Beauchamp, who had a decided taste for the sciences, attended
the College de France, and made a rapid progress; I seconded
his (urn for astronomy by showing him how useful he could
be to us in Asia.        In 1780 he made it his chief study, and
was of great service to us. Soon after he set out for the East,
and on the 15th of September 1781 arrived at Aleppo with
his uncle, who was not able to continue his journey. Young
Beauchamp, therefore, proceeded alone to Bagdad to dis
charge the episcopal functions.
    In 1781 I obtained from the minister of the marine in
struments which I sent to him, and which he employed with
great advantage.         An account of his journey from Aleppo to
Bagdad was published in the Journal des Savaris for 1784:
his observations made at Bagdad, and some notices respect
 ing the Turks and the Arabs, may be found in the some
work *. In the month of January 1784 he set out for Bas-
 sora : a chart of the course of the Tigris and the Euphrates
from Diarbeker to the Persian gulph, that is to fay, for an
 extent of 300 leagues, which he constructed on that occasion,

journey in the Journal des Savans for 1785 t. ¦ The different

was maltreated and plundered, and he was thrown into                  a
fever which lasted eighteen months. He however constructed
•a chart of his route, which Baron von Zach has published.
 He observed an eclipse of the moon at Casbine on the 30th
of .-June 1787  :   was one of the most important ever ob

    Baron von Zach, in his excellent journal, has made fre

 of the stars, and he had ascertained that of several thousands,

 drawn the annual gratification of 2000 livres which he en

 back to Bagdad to resume his observations. In the month of
 February 1795 I obtained from the Convention, through the
 means of Grcgoire, an indemnification for him ; and on
 that occasion Beauchamp said, " I see that you draw upon
 me a bill of exchange which I can pay only in Turkey.          I
 shall therefore set out ; but if any misfortune befalls me you
 must remember mv devotion to you and to astronomy."           He
 indeed quitted, with some degree of regret, a country and
family which he loved, and by which he was beloved.           But
 it was not till the 3d of March 1795 that I obtained, by the
 aid of C. Volney, his nomination to the consulship of Mas-
 cate, in Arabia.    He came to Paris on the 27th of March,
 but was obliged to proceed to Italy to procure a ship bound
 to Constantinople : he encountered various impediments, and
 in the month of April 1706 was         ill
                                      ft.     in
                                            Italy.   He at length
 set out, went to make sonic observations     in the Archipelago,
 and did not arrive at Constantinople till the 22d of Novem
 ber 1796.     Towards the cud of May 1797 he undertook a
journey from Constantinople to Trebisonde, which was of
 great importance to geography, as he rectified the charts of
 the Black sea, which were exceedingly erroneous.          On the
 oth of December the fame year he returned from the Black
 lea, and made preparations for proceeding to Mascate but ;
 the war rendered this voyage dangerous ana useless.
    In the month of March 179X he was sent to Egypt till he
 could find an opportunity of proceeding to Maseate, and, to
 wards the conclusion of that year, offered to Bonaparte to go
 as
  a   negotiator for peace to Constantinople; but he was ar
 rested as well as all the other French, and remained three
years in confinement.
    Being at length set at liberty, in consequence of the peace,
 he quitted Constantinople on the 23d of September 1801,
 though still indisposed,   and had scarcely arrived at Nice
 when he expired on the lytli of November.         A few days be
 fore, he had been appointed by the first consul commissary-
general at Lisbon; and he lived long enough to learn that
 this distinguished mark of favour had been conferred upon
him.
   Few men have employed the stiort course of human life
to so  much purpose.      Beauchamp possessed knowledge and
merit of .various kinds: the duties of religion were not neg
lected  by  this philosopher, and the congregation of the Pro-
           at Rome testified its satisfaction with the zeal he
Eaganda

    Never was astronomer exposed to so many hardships in
making observations.          By the excessive heat of Bagdad he
was reduced sometimes to a state of the greatest debility, and
his laborious and dangerous journeys always brought on severe
illness. He died a victim to his zeal ; and it increases our re

so great.     [The annexed engraving represents Beauchamp in

VIII. FURTHER             progress   of  tbe tbeoretico-praclical fart of
clock- and ivatcb-viaking till tbe end of tbe i8tb century. — In
order to render the oscillations of the large clocks isochronous,
Huyghens invented the cycloidal plate ; and De la Hire assures
us, that this cycloidal pendulum clock, though often com
pared with the motion of the fixed stars, did not differ in
tight days but a few seconds from the mean motion of the
lun. But Huyghens himself soon found that the plate could
not be made in a cycloidal form, and that the silken threads
 by which the pendulum was suspended did not answer the
purpose, but that a pliable spring could be used in their stead.
He then invented, tor the purpose os more perfect regula
tion, that singular pendulum called pirouette, which has a
cruciform motion. This, however, was also rejected. About
the end of the 17th century, Derham and Hook conceived
 the idea of making the pendulum swing in small arches, and
 applying heavy lenticular weights. This method was adopted
 by Le Bon and De Rivaz at Paris, and bv Clement in Lon
don, who also invented the so called English pallet. The
author here gives an account of the discovery, that the
 pendulum does not every where vibrate with the fame velo
 city, its vibrations being quicker near the pole aud flower
 towards the equator; on which account, clocks that go well in
one place alter their rate of going when brought near to the
                                                                     pole

pole or the equator.     He also mentions the disadvantages at
tending   the stopping   of the balance-wheel in watches ; and
 relates what Sully, Hook, Uautefeuille, and Du Tertre, in
dividually did to obviate this stopping; and also the experi
ments of Le Roy, Tompion, Flamevitle, and Facio, in this
respect.    Berthoud taught the method of cutting the teeth
in the balance-wheel mathematically.        John Prier of Lon
don, and Samuel Anguilins, a Swede, made researches also
on the same subject. The author mentions also Schott's pro
posal in regard to moderatingpendulum clocks, as also those
of Du Tertre and Le Koy. The recoil scapement, invented
by Clement in 1680, was changed by Graham for a dead
scapement, according to which the scapement-wheel at each,
fall of the pallet remains at rest.     Graham also made the
scapement in watches to rest by means of the cvlinder and
pallet-wheel ; by which the friction was lessened, and the
machinery rendered sitter for greater and easier vibrations.
This scapement, however, requires oil, which is often hurt
ful.    In order to lessen friction still more with the dead
scapement, Berthoud improved an invention of Mudge, which
consists in this, that the balance-wheel is not checked by the
balance itself, but by a particular catch which the balance
lets loose, by which means the balance continues its oscilla
tions while the wheel is retained by the catch. The balance
makes two vibrations, one forwards and another backwards,
so that the tooth brought to rest is set free at the second vi
bration.    This kind of scapement, which is a striking proof
of human ingenuity, is called the free. The author here
describes, in an interesting manner, the different kinds of
free scapements invented by Magellans, Platier, Rendal, Ro
bins, Grant, and Breguet.       From the end of the 17th cen
tury, celebrated mathematicians employed themselves in en
deavouring to discover a general theory for all the parts of
watches, of which the author gives a particular account.
Another difficulty to be overcome in regard to clocks and
watches, was the influence which heat and cold has upon,
the expansion and contraction of metals, and which alters
the motion of the whole.       Graham is considered as the first;
who made experiments with a view of freeing the pendulum
from such changes. He first conceived the idea of making
pendulums of ebonv, fir-wood, walnut-tree, &c.j but found
that the moisture of the air produced other inconveniences.
Experiments of the fame kind were afterwards made by Ma.
gellan, Fontana, Ludlam, Schroter, Crostwaite, and Kohler.

 358                 Notices respecting New Boois,
 instead of an iron tube filled with quicksilver, employed one
 of glass, having at the end a bulb like the tube of a ther
 mometer.        But still happier was Graham's idea, to construct
 a pendulum of several rods of different metals, so combined,
 that the expansion of the one should be fully compensated by
 the contraction of the other; and this gave rife to the grid
 iron pendulum.        Before Graham, however, Short, Cafsini,
  and Eilicot had entertained a similar idea of a compound
  pendulum ; and the plan of a gridiron pendulum was first car
 ried into execution by Harrison in the year 1726.             The au
 thor here gives a description of the pendulums proposed bv
  Graham and Harrison; and mentions the experiments of
 Berthoud,      Greuicr, and SytTert, for improving them.           He
 speaks also of Ellicot's lever pendulum,         Grenier's lever pen
 dulum, and the pendulum with the small gridiron ; as also
  Rivaz's tubular pendulum ; and the simplest compensation
 pendulum of all, invented bv Fageot, a Swede, about the
 year 1740, and which Schmidt the watchmaker,               of Stettin,
 has lately employed with much ingenuity.             The highest de
 gree of perfection, however, to which watch-making has at
 tained, is in the construction of the nautical time-keepers,
 for the invention of which large premiums were offered in
 England, France, Holland, and Spain.                 Huyghens and
 SulTey made attempts for this purpose, but they were not
 attended with success; and the ingenious proposals of Leib
 nitz were not found sufficient.       Harrison's first time-keeper,
 which he presented to the Roval Society in 1736, was regu
 lated bv balancing rods placed crosswise over each other, with
 circular springs at the ends, which relied against two plates,
 which by the dilatation of the circular springs, in consequence
 of heat, separated, and on their contraction bvcold approached
 each other.      The friction also was lessened, and the time
  keeper was suspended like the mariner's compass. In a voyage
 of twelve weeks, the error in going amounted only to 36 se
  conds.      A second one, constructed in 1749, which was
  smaller and more convenient,          surpassed   the first.   To a
  third, constructed in 17.53, 'ie aPP''e^ a balance with a spiral
  spring, and a compensation rod of brass and steel.           In 1761
  he constructed a fourth, which, on a voyage of experiment
  that lasted 81 days, erred only 1 minute 34! seconds.               A
  fifth, siniflied in 1764, erred only 54 seconds in fix weeks.
  Dr. Malkelyne, however, to whom it was afterwards re
  ferred for trial, did not give so favourable a report of
  it. Berthoud and Le Roy made attempts also to construct
  time-keepers; but the first were not successful.         In the year
  1 741 Le Roy's time-keeper,       which in six weeks erred only
  half a degree, was preferred to that of Berthoud, which in the
                                                                  lame
*

The balance vibrated altogether independent of the wheel-
work, and always received from the moving power a new
impulse, which at each vibration was uniform. The balance
had two spiral springs, which produced a very uniform action.
Besides this, the machine was furnished with a compensation
balance.    In imitation of the nautical time-keepers, pocket
chronometers were constructed.      These serve for determining
the geographical longitude at land.     In these the free scape-
ment ot Mudge is employed.      •
                                  Emery, an artist from Neuf-
chatel, made the first, which, after a passage of four weeks,
gave the longitude of St. John's, Newfoundland, correct
within six seconds.    Another, constructed by Mudge, in a
voyage of 14 weeks, erred only 17 seconds.          Mudge never
made but two pocket chronometers.          Arnold    made above
000, of various constructions.    His chronometers of the best
Kind, with gold cafes, cost 120 guineas, with silver cafes, 100.
   In the year 1500 the art of clock- and watch-making in
 Germany became a particular branch of business. The author
here gives an historical sketch of the origin and progress of
watch-making in Swisserland from the year 1679 t0 l"e Pre-
sent time, particularly in Neufchatel and Valengin, which
will be read with great interest. In both these districts there
are at present 3634 clock- and watch-makers.          One Abra
 ham Robert invented there an instrument which serves for
adjusting the teeth of the wheels and pinions.         The fame
artist conceived the idea also of a dead scapement.      Perrelet
invented the instrument for placing wheels straight; and Re
corder watches, which wind themselves up. The most ce
lebrated watch-maker in Chaux de Fond, where there are
 above 400, is James Droz, who has obtained great celebrity
 by the construction of some very curious automata.

to find the planet in antient catalogues of stars. Mr. Melsier
•was very near it in the year 1779.         The famous comet of
that year ran just over the northern wing of Virgo, as now,
and the new planet was not very far distant.           If the comat
had attained two months sooner the completion of Virgo,
Mr. Melsier must infallibly have observed the Ceres then,
because he determined all the little stars in the vicinity of the
comet j the planet would have been in the way of the comet,
and so, of course, he would have catched the little planet in

    On the 29th of April and the 6th of May, the reading of
Count Bournon's paper on corundum was continued, and
on the 13th of May was concluded.         It furnislies a complete
and scientific mineralogical description of that substance.
    On the 6th and 13th of May there were read two papers
communicated by Dr. Herschel, giving an account of his
observations during the late fine weather upon the two new
celestial bodies discovered by M. Piazzi of Palermo, and Dr,
Olbers of Bremen, and by them respectively called Ceres Fer-
dinandea, and Pallas. In our Magazine for March last, some
account was given of a former paper by Dr. Herschel, where
in he formed an estimate of the magnitude of Ceres by com
                                                              paring

paring its apparent disc with that of the Georgian planet. It
was then thought very extraordinary that the calculations,
founded upon such a comparison, and upon the most proba
ble distance of Ceres from the fun, made the real diameter
of that newly-discovered celestial body certainly less than
5-8ths of the diameter of our moon. By Dr. Herschel's
subsequent observations, however, detailed in the first of the
two papers above mentioned, and whieh were made in much
more favourable weather, the diameter of Ceres was found
much smaller than what he inferred it to be from his former
observations of the nth of February.         His later observations
consisted chiefly in his taking repeated measures by means of
his lamp-micrometer;       an apparatus long ago contrived by
Dr. Hersche!, and published in the Philosophical Transac
tions, for estimating the extent of angles much smaller than
a second of a degree.        By similar observations he found the
apparent   diameter  of  Pallas to be less than that of Ceres ; and
from those apparent diameters, and the best data for the di
stances from the fun, Dr. Herschel has computed their real
diameters to be about 160 miles for Ceres, and about 80 for
Pallas; from which it appears, that out of the quantity of
matter which the planet Mercury contains 73,839 such bodies
as Pallas could be formed.       The existence of such relatively
minute bodies in the heavens belonging to the solar system,
and moving according to the law of gravitation, is a circum
stance which appears to us extremely interesting; the know
ledge of which must still further distinguish the present asra,
of astronomy, which has already been rendered 10 illustrious
by Dr. Henchel's own labours in the field of discovery.
   In his paper of the 6th of May he gives an account of
several observations    of a small coma or haziness which sur
rounded both Ceres and Pallas, the appearance and extent of
which seemed to vary according to the state of the air. An
account is also given of the method he followed to satisfy him
self that these two stars have no satellites belonging to them.
   In the fame paper Dr. Herschel points out the advantage
of distinguishing such new celestial bodies from the planets
and comets by some appropriate name which will admit of
a full and precise definition.    By reason of their differing so
much from planets and comets as scarcely to be perceivable
from minute fixed stars, even by very good telescopes, Doctor
Herschel has adopted the term asteroids to denote them ; but
reserving the liberty of substituting afterwards any other ap
pellation which he may think more apposite, and to which
the precise and copious definition laid down in his paper may
equally apply. He next remarks, that from the nature of
                                                           asteroids

  qfteroids the discovery   of such bodies in the heavens necessarily'
  requires a particular method of observing, which hitherto astro
 nomers have but seldom pursued. On account of their minute
 ness, they so far lie beyond the power of good telescopes to di
 stinguish them, that Dr. Herschel in his five different reviews
 of the zodiac detected none of those concealed objects; where
 as, had they less resembled very small telescopic stars, he must;
 have infallibly detected them.       It is therefore, he fays, only
 by a diligent and accurate attention to minute stars, in the
 view of discovering amongst them such as may be in motion,
 that asteroids can successfully be distinguished from the mul
 titudinous collection of telescopical        stars which so much
 abound in the heavens.         A search of this kind, from its na
 ture, cannot be carried on except in observatories furnished
 with fixed instruments, which, it is well known, make no
 part of Dr. HerschePs apparatus.          In the conclusion of his
 paper, honourable notice is taken of the association of twenty-
 four astronomers in Germany who have portioned out the
 zodiac into as many parts, in order more effectually to explore
Jt. As this new method of searching, in the hands of Piazzi
 and Olbers, so quickly produced important discoveries, Doctor
Herschel thinks it highly probable that more celestial bodies
of the class of asteroids remain concealed, which may sooner
or later be found out in consequence of their observed motions.

          Description   of  the Satin   Spar,   by  A. Aihin.
    The    satin spar, characteristic specimens of which have
been presented to the society's cabinet by the late Mr. Mohr,
and Mr. Richard Phillips, is a mineral as yet peculiar to the
neighbourhood of Alston Moor, in Cumberland, where it
lies so near the surface as to be occasionally thrown up by
the plough.
    Its colour is a pure white, sometimes stained by an ochrey
yellow tint of more or less intensity.
    It occurs in thin strata from one to three or four inches
thick, traversed by thin irregular seams of pyrites parallel to
the direction of the stratum.
    Its lustre is between pearly and satiny, considerably cha
toyant.
                                                                 Its

   Its perpendicular fracture is straight or (lightly waved
fibrous, discovering an obscure fine stratification parallel to
the direction of the whole stratum : hence the varying or
chatoyant lustre is observed only when moving it in the di
rection of the fibres. The cross or parallel fracture requires
a stronger blow to effect it than the former, and presents a
compact, broad, splintery surface.
   When broken, it flies into flattened fibrous fragments.
   In thin pieces it is semi-transparent.
   Can just be scratched by the nail : is brittle : non-elastic :
 sp. gr. 2*709 to 3*731.   may be polished to almost

       Analysis     of   tbe Satin Spar,       by   Mr. H.        Pepys    junior.
                          Preliminary     Experiments.
    A piece of about 400 grains was exposed to red heat for            a
two hours.         lost near i-4th of its weight, and was much,
                    It
altered in its appearance,      having lost its smooth feel.    Upou
immersion in water,          imbibed
                                it       with
                                            it    hissing sound,
                                                             a     be
came hot, fell to powder, and            portion of
                                            a           was dissolved.it
The solution was rendered turbid                        by
                                               carbonic acid. The
undissolved     portion effervesced slightly with acids, and had
obtained an hepatic smell from some adhering pyrites.
    A portion of the crude spar, carefully freed from all ad
hering pyrites, dissolved completely in nitric acid, with effer
vescence.      This solution was examined with the following
re-agents       :
     On adding sulphuric acid to        portion of the solution, the
                                           a
two fluids became nearly solid, and much heat was extri
cated   ;  proving the presence of lime, strontian, or barytes.
     Strontian water gave         precipitate of
                                      a                brown colour,
                                                                 a
which was again soluble in nitric acid.
     Barytic water gave precipitate of rather
                                a                     darker hue than
                                                                 a
 the strontian     this was also soluble in the nitric acid.
                    :
     Tinclure os galls, prussiate of potash, and ammonia, gave
 flight traces of the presence os iron.
     A solution of sulphate of soda gave the same granulated
 precipitate as with      solution of nitrate of lime.
                            a
     100 grains of the picked satin spar were exposed to the
 action of aoo grains of nitiic acid of sp. gr. 1*35             vessel     in a
of     a conical form furnished with        small glass worm on the
                                                    a
 top, that, fliould any fluid be carried up                      by

duct,      might be deposited in its passage. This and the vessel

                                                                  were

                  British Mineralogical    Society*
 were previously weighed. A strong effervescence ensued tipori
 mixture : the gas produced was heavier than atmospheric air j
 extinguished flame ; produced a clouded precipitate in lime^
 ftrontian, and barytic water.      200 grains of the acid being
 found not sufficient for the solution ofthe substance, 100 grains
 more were carefully added : effervescence again took place,
 and more of the same gas was liberated. It was then exposed
 to a heat of 200 degrees Fahrenheit.       Upon cooling, it had
lost 46 grains.
    250 grains of the most perfect part of the satin spar were
not soluble in 500 grains of nitric acid of the specific gravity
 1*25 : upon the addition of 250 grains more, there was ob
tained a solution nearly colourless. It was then diluted with
distilled water, and evaporated to the consistence of a strong
syrup, without exhibiting any symptoms of crystallization,
though the evaporation was suspended, and the solution set
to cool, thrice during the process. The concentrated solution
became slightly yellow.
    100 grains in solution in nitric acid, lest to spontaneous
evaporation in a warm, dry place, after standing two months
exhibited no crystals.
                             Analyjis.
    A. For the carbonic acid. — 250 grains of picked spar were
dissolved in 757 grains of nitric acid of the specific gravity
of 1*25 : the gas produced was received over mercury.            It
changed the colour of tincture of litmus red, and was ab
sorbed within one- hundredth of the whole by barytic water,
giving a copious precipitate, which was soluble, and effer
vesced upon the addition of diluted acid.          119 grains were
given off by this treatment, equal to 476 per cent.
    B. For tbe calcareous earth. — The nitric solution A was
diluted with an equal quantity of distilled water: upon the
addition of diluted sulphuric acid it became nearly solid : it
was then further diluted and filtered. The precipitate, dried
in a heat of 212 °, weighed 433 grains. It was then brought
to a red heat, after which it weighed 330 grains.
    C. For tbe iron. — The solution B was then treated with
caustic or pure ammonia, which gave a slight red florulent
precipitate. This precipitate, being filtered and dried, weighed
3 grains, equal to about 0-3 of metallic iron.
    D. The solution C was then evaporated, during which,
previous to the formation of any crystals of sulphate of am
monia, 7 grains of crystals of selcnite were deposited of a silky
needle-formed appearance.
    E. The seleaite B and D, = 337 grains, were decomposed
                                                                by

in the first analysis must therefore have been produced from
some small pyritic grains in the substance of the spar then
employed.      Its quantity, as may be observed, was only
about a thousandth of the whole.
 Remarks on the Affinities     of Lime,   Strontian,   and Barytes.
    Previous to the foregoing analysis it was necessary to in*
stitutc a few experiments on the affinities of the above-men
tioned substance : as the results may perhaps be useful to
others, they are here subjoined.
    A solution of nitrate of lime in distilled water, is partially,
but not immediately, precipitated by a solution of caustic
strontian.    On joining the two, the mixture assumes a sizey
appearance.
     A   precipitation takes place also in a solution of nitrate of
lime, when a solution of caustic barytes is added. The pre
cipitate falls down much sooner in this cafe, and in more
considerable quantity, than when the solution of strontian is
employed.
  Nitrate of barytes in solution is immediately decomposed
by pouring into it a solution of sulphate of soda, which pro
duces a copious precipitate.
  Nitrate of strontian in solution is also decomposed by sul
phate of soda when a solution of the latter is poured into        it,
but much flower than the nitrated barytes.
   A solution of nitrate of lime, upon having solution of
                                                        a

   The meeting was numerous and splendid, many ladies of
the first rank and fasliion being present.
   Our limits do not allow us to insert at this time a list of
the successful candidates : we cannot, however, close the pre
sent article without mentioning that this society, to which
the nation owes so much for bringing forward numerous va
luable discoveries and improvements, was the first to award,
some months ago, an honorary and pecuniary recompense to
Mr. Henry Greathead, of South Shields, for his construction
of a life-boat, by which the lives of many persons shipwrecked
have already been preserved.
   The life-boat is now coming into general use ; and, from
the exertions making by the gentlemen at Lloyd's, who have
devoted 2000I., and other patriotic individuals, who are con
tributing their money and exertions to the establishment of
them on every part of our coasts, we have the pleasing pro*
spect of many thousands of valuable lives being preserved to
their families and to the community by this inestimable con
trivance. The reward of the Society to Mr. Greathead was
their gold medal ! and fifty guineas.
   IMPERIAL ACADEMY OF THE SEARCHERS INTO
                              NATURE.
   The following prize questions      have been proposed for the
year   1
         803  :
    I.  Germany produces a considerable quantity of umbelli
ferous plants endowed with medicinal properties, which are as
yet unknown, or known but imperfectly or from conjecture.
Only     a few  of these have been admitted into the new dispen
satories,   and into Murray's apparatus Mcdicamcntorum.     The
                                                        number

                                                                   '
number of the umbelliferous plants growing wild in Germany
may be reckoned to be about 115: of thele, Elirhart, in the
seventh volume of his Collections, names forty-four as offi
cinal, which he has extracted from different dispensatories :
but there are many of them the virtue and effects of which
are not sufficiently or accurately determined, which were
adopted in the old dispensatories,     but which are no longer
considered as medicinal.     Murray, on this account, makes
the number of those which ought to be retained twenty-
eight; a number still lessened in the dispensatories of other
countries, but which comprehends species which, in general,
may be accounted medicinal.        The academy wishes, there
fore, to have determined — Whether there are any of the
German umbelliferous plants not yet admitted into the Ma-
teria Aledica which possess considerable virtue in medicine?
What these virtues arc? In what diseases, and in what man
ner, these plants, or individual parts of them, can be used ?
Those who employ, themselves on these questions must seledt
at least five species besides those mentioned by Murray,
in order to ascertain, by chemical and medical experiments,
the vSi:s and purposes to which they can be applied.       Jt will
be agreeable to the academy, if those authors who have fur
nished any hints towards these researches be pointed out;
but the writers must not content themselves with mere quota
tions.
    II. The phænomena which have been observed in the ef
fects produced bv the Voltaic pile afford the most pleasing
prospect of suture discoveries in chemistry, physiology, and
medicine, and even give reason to expect some conclusions
in regard to the oblcure secret of life and organization.
Though we are still too far from having discovered the
 grounds of these phænomena to entertain a hope that such
 conclusions can be soon obtained — as an attempt to arrange
 and to reduce into a systematic form the many and various
observations which have been made since the invention of
 the above apparatus by the industry and spirit of research,
 and particularly of the German chemists, might contribute
 to brine; us nearer to the object in view, the Society proposes
 as the subject of a prize a treatise on this discovery, and re
 quires*
    1st, That the author will collect all the observations made
 before the beginning of the year 1803, and deduce from
 them a series of principles systematically arranged, quoting
 the names of the observers, and also the works which con
 tain an account of their observations.
    2d, That he will make new experiments in regard to those

  principles not fully proved,  and,  if possible, form from them
 some decisive conclusion.
     3d, That in establishing these principles he will make
 decisive   experiments in regard to the action of the Voltaic
  pile  on  unorganized bodies, on pure water, alkalies, acids,
  metals, &c. ; then on organized bodies, and particularly
  on dead bodies (in promoting or preventing putrefaction) ;
  and on living, in regard to shocks, pricking sensation, taste,
  luminous appearance, &c.
'
     4th, That the author will attend in particular to the sup
  posed identity of the galvanic power and electricity ; and will
 mention and give an opinion on the explanations of the phæ-
  nomenon offered by others, and particularly on those of
  M. Ritter. It will be agreeable also to the academy if the
  author will make experiments and observations of his own
  to confirm or refute the hypothesis of M. Ritter; and if he
  will employ Lavoisier's theory to explain these phænomena.
     5th, That he will apply the principles and conclusions in
  the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 41!) articles, to the practice of physic
  in particular; and endeavour to determine theoretically how
  far, and in what manner, the use of the Voltaic pije in me
  dicine may be salutary ? That he will collect, arrange sys
  tematically, try, and give some opinion of the observations
  already made by Grapengiesser, Hagenbach, Huber, &c. That
  he will make experiments of his own on the subject, and
  describe their consequences, both negative and positive, with
  fidelity and without prejudice; and will always mention the
  mode of application, for example, the position and number
  of the metallic plates, and whether formed into one or more
  piles connected together, &c.
     The papers, written in Latin, German, or French, ac
  cording to the usual regulations, must be transmitted to the
  president of the academy, at Erlangen, before the 1st of Oc
 tober 1803.
     The prize is a gold medal of the value of 25 ducats, and
  will be adjudged to the successful candidate on the 5th of
  January 1804.
          SOCIETY OF THE SCIENCES AT FLUSHING.
     Some years ago, a stone having been found at Domburg,
  in the island of Walcheren, containing an inscription in
  which mention is made of a certain female divinity named
  Buronin.i, the above Society have proposed the following
  questions  :
      Who   was the goddess Buronina, who seems to have been
  worihipped by the antient inhabitants, or by foreigners who
                                                            resided

April.
   In   the sciences,  when a way is once opened to great and
important discoveries, it sometimes happens that they loon
follow each other in succession. It is now only about twenty
years since the celebrated Dr. Herschel made a discovery of
which we have no previous instance in hillory, viz. of a new
primarv rflanet. On the ill of January 1801 another was dis
covered bv Piazzi ; and a year after, a third new one has excited
the curiosity of the public. On the 2Sth of March an account
was published in the Reicbsuzngcr, No. 98, that Dr. Olbers,
of Bremen, equally celebrated as a physician and an astro
nomer, had been so fortunate as to observe a moving star in
the north wins of Virgo, perfectly similar in its form and
light to the Ceres Ferdinandea; scarcely distinguishable from
a fixed star of the seventh magnitude; without any nebu
losity, and retrograde like Ceres, but increasing much more
in its northern declination. After observing this star for
three days, and ascertaining that it had a motion peculiar to
itself, he sent notice of his discovery to Baron s-on Z:ich, of
 Got ha    The latter immediately found this small star, ob
served it on the 4th and 5th of April at the observatory of
Seeberg, and found Dr. Olbers's observations confirmed in
the fullest manner.      This star, to which he was inclined to
give the name of Pallas in order to distinguish it from Ceres,
appeared to him to be somewhat less bright than the latter.
Mr. Schreiter, of Lilienthal, who, inconsequence of the in
formation communicated to him by Dr. Olbers, observed
this star with his 13 feet telescope, considers it to be some
what larger and better defined than Ceres : its diameter he
estimates at 4      seconds, whereas that of Ceres is only 4.
But the observations made by Dr. Olbers aud Baron von
                              A  a 2                        Zach

sun 3,-Vth of the distance of our earth from the sun, and the
place of the ascending node 5s 200.
   Mr. Walker, lecturer on astronomy, has observed this
body, and describes it as being of a pale red colour, very
faint, and less brilliant than the Ceres, visible with a defin
able disc with a magnifying power of 100 times.
   As the distance of this small body from the earth is in
creasing, and its light decreasing, astronomers must hasten
to make good observations if they are desirous of determining
its orbit in an accurate manner: it will otherwise be difficult
to find it again.
   The following notice from the astronomer Burckhardt
contains some further useful information on this interesting
discovery :
   " The star discovered by Dr. Olbers on the 28th of March
has so great a resemblance to a planet, that it was natural to
suppose its orbit to be somewhat eccentric.    I have placed it
successively between the earth and Mars, between Mars and
Piazzi's planet, and between the latter and Jupiter. I have
employed "the eccentricities of one and of two tenths (those
of Mars and Mercury), but neither of these suppositions has
succeeded.    It is easy to make a very small eccentricity an
swer to the longitudes, but the latitudes do not indeed begin
to approach each other but by supposing it to be very great,
(four sixteenths).
   "  These researches seem to me to prove that we must sup
pose a very eccentric orbit ; and I have begun to calculate a
parabolic orbit as for a comet, and the elements I have found
are as follows  :
Inclination of the orbit         -       -      540   58'   30"

tify the curiosity which the possibility of another new planet
seems to have excited in the public.

                      METEOROLOGY.
  At Derby,   an uncommon phænomenon             appeared in the
air a few mornings ago: it consisted of four circles, and
part of another, in the following order : — The smallest, which
was nearest to the fun, might be fifteen degrees diameter, with
luminous spots to the right and left, like what are called bara-
helia ; the second encompassed the former, and was twice as
large; the third the size of the second, and joined its cir
cumference to the west; and the fourth circumscribed all the
others, and was touched upon the western side by part of an
other of the fame diameter.
                 VACCINE INOCULATION.
  This useful practice   seems to be gaining ground in Spain.
Dr.   Francisco Piguillem has published the following work in
recommendation of it : — La Vacuna en EspaHit, o Cartas Fa-
miliares Jobre ejla nueva Inoculacion, ejeritas a una Seiiora,
por el Dr. Francisco Piguillem.     That   is,
                                             The Vaccine in
Spain, or Familiar Letters on this new Inoculation, &c.
Madrid, 8vo. In Catalonia, above 7000 persons were ino
culated between the month of December 1800, and Sep
tember 1801.     " On. the highest mountains and amidst the
severest cold, in the deepest valleys and amidst the greatest
heat, (fays the letter from which this account was taken,)
the inoculation has been attended with complete success."
   A letter from Portugal to Dr. Alibert at Paris, after men
tioning the opposition which has hitherto been made to the
vaccine inoculation in that country, fays, — " Somcrone has
found here, in  a  Portuguese work, that the vaccine inocula

                            GALVANISM.
    A letter from Germany savs, the effect of galvanism in
curing deafness has been fullv confirmed at Jever.           We
learn also from (.'assel that M. Schaub, apothecary of that
place, has cured a person who had been deaf for eighteen
years by three weeks use of the Voltaic pile.        Mart. Fris-
chesen, a Benedictine, and professor of philosophy- at Salz
burg, has performed a number of succes»fu! cures on the
blind, lame, and deaf, bv means of a pile consisting of 300
 plates; which has encouraged several of the physicians there
to make experiments of the fame kind.           This remedy has
 been emploved        also with success bv Dr. Grapcngiesier of
 Berlin, Dr. Martens of Leipsic, and others.
                           MINERALOGY.
    About three years ago, C. Pontier met with some frag
 ments of chromated iron in the Lower Alps, but out of its
 place. Circumstances anting from the war prevented his
 ascertaining its true position in the earth.   He has at length
 found the natural place of this curious mineral in a quarry
 near Gaffin, in the road to Cavalaire.      This metal is mixed
 with green serpentine rock, which owes its colour, probably,
 to chrome.      It sometimes forms masses of live solid decime
 tres each.
                            ANTIQUITIES.
     M. Baguerie, of Bourdeaux, has sent to the nnisæum of
 that city a mummy found in one of the caverns at the bot
 tom of the peak of Tenerisse.       This mummy seems to he of
 a different kind from any hitherto described, and to have been
  piepared in  a  different manner.
