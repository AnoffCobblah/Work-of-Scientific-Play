 I. Memoir vpon          the Apes      with,   imperfect Hands, or the
              Ateles.     By    GEOFFROY      ST.  HILAIRE *.
 WUR        menagerie     at    Paris   has lately acquired two apes
 without     thumbs on the          fore paws : hitherto one species
 only,    remarkable for this singularity, has been recognised,
viz. the coaita of Buffon, or the simia paniscus of Linnaeus :
it is an ape from America ; its hair is entirely black, and it
 passes from branch to branch by using the extremity                   of its
 tail.    Our two new apes resemble the coaita in the propor
 tions of their bodies, by their slender shape, their spiderr
 like limbs,     and particularly by their long tail ; but they
 differ from the coaita in the colour of the belly, which in
 the former is of a dirty white.           If they are of a small size,
 it  is only    because they are not full grown ; which we may
judge     from    the circumstance of the canine teeth having
 scarcely yet made their appearance out of the alveoli, and
 from     their skin    being shaggy, and wanting              equality and
 smoothness.
    Nevertheless these circumstances do not induce us to re
 gard them as young ones of the simia paniscus ; because,
 on the one hand, we have seen a small individual of that
 species entirely similar to its father and mother;              and, on the
 other hand, we have found that this species has already ap
  peared in Europe, and has been described in its perfect state.
     An adult ape, without thumbs to its hands, having a
  whitish belly, was publicly exhibited, in 1750, by the name
  of belzebut : after its death it passed into the cabinet of
        '   * From Annales   dit Musfum d'Hiitmre Naturtlle, tome vii.

4         Memoir   upon the Apes     with imperfect Hands.
 Reaumur,     where   M. Brisson   saw it  :  it was an exact Coun
 terpart of the species which this naturalist describes by the
 name of simia bvlzdtit.
    Buffon, when writing, some years afterwards, the last
 volume of his History of Animals, had before him only a
 single ape with four ringers, the coaita, which we have al
 ready mentioned : he applied to it all the descriptions of the
 authors who had spoken of apes deprived of one toe in the
 fore feet; and from this moment the species of Brisson, al
 though nominally comprised in this work, was suppressed :
two other apes are in the same situation ; the ape of Brown,
with brown hair, and the chamek, in which we find the
root of a toe, and of which there is a detailed description
by Buffon himself,
    Linnaeus, was one of the first to adopt these reductions,
in which he was followed by all the naturalists : thinking
the name of bclzebut to have no meaning, 'he transferred           the
 name   of a jumping    ape, the guariba of Marcgrave, to it.
    Thus   these  different  apes had been regarded as so many
individual varieties, and it must be confessed that it was
scarcely possible to form any other opinion at that time:
we are at present in a situation of retracing these first
views. Time, in making us acquainted with a greater num
ber  of individuals of  each   of ihese   apes,    showing them by
fixed and immutable traits, and furnishing us with the means
of judging of them comparatively, admits of our giving here
a  more rigorous determination.
    As these four apes are not only analogous by the want of
the finger, but as they also resemble each other, besides, by
the strange* proportions of their bodies and by the form of
the head,   I think  we sbould point out their degree of affinity
hy separating them from       the other apes with the prehensile
tail, and classing them under the same generic denomina
tion : I have given the name of ateles to this small family,
a denomination      proper for describing        the imperfection   of
their hapds.
   These apes are so remarkable on account of the dispropor
tion between their limbs and their bodies, that some of them
have received the name     of spider apes.   The orangs alone    have
                                                               longer

look       is,   that their tail       is longer than the extremities, and which
seems to embarrass                     them very much when they sit down.
  The ateles, also, ntarly approach the orangs      the form                                   by

hair with which the head   covered, for the most part, in

and uell          rounded towards the top.                                In common with              all the
apes of America, their nostrils                                 are open at one sirle, and se
parated          by   a    large division.
     The body      small and long
                            is            remarkably slender,   :    it   is
and, as     were, strangled
                 it         towards the belly; appears, how                           it
ever, fuller about the chest, the capacityof which seems to
be large enough.   The skin   hindered from growing comis
pletely over the sides of the belly     the thighs, which,                 by
when the animal sits, approach very close to it.
   The legs are nearly                     in
                        the same proportions,    not little                                if        a
shorter than the arms.                            The foot                has   a    broader       base than
the hand, which                      can    only be attributed to the existence                           of
the additional                 toe or finger               in       the   former;          the metatarsal
bones       and        the bones            of   the       phalanges are at least as long
as the analogous little bones in the fore extremities.      The

     The tail, with which               we    see     the animal so encumbered,
plays a distinguished part in its various movements.    We
know no species of ape with a longer tail, and in particular
there is none whose tail possesses more muscular strength.
The     ateles make use        of it for       every purpose   they wish lo

which serves oftenest and most emcacioosly for seizing any
thing, that    to say, the lower extremity,
               is                           deprived of hair,      is
and covered        with   a   thick      and as       it   were callous epidermis.
     The manners of           the       ateles differ very little from those                of
the sapajou  they send forth the same shrill cry, resembling
               ;
the whistling of small birds    the night        in
                                             at other times        ;                        it
is  aweaker cry, soft and melodious,    which they seem to    by
express complaints or fatigue.   They are also very sensible
to the cold of our climate.
   Although kept in heated place they are not the les* at

tentive to sitting down and folding themselves forward, and
in this situation their tail             serves for an excellent                  fur for co
vering the parts most exposed. Our two young individuals
are more careful still   they combat every loss of heat
                                   :                                                        by

this spectacle, and testify how singular     appeared to them    it
to see two heads thus continually in motion and agitated                                    by
different sensations, while their bodies were so closely joined
together in  manner which naturally expresses the most af

most lively regret, following each other with their eyes,
and stretching towards each other.  When shut up in the
same cage, they were rarely separate                      from each other           ;     the
one either negligently rests upon the other, or mounts its
back and picks off the vermin to which this species is very
subject.  They feed together in common ; and on these oc
casions the sentiment of self-love seems not to prevail, or
           not excite any serious disputes between them :
at least does
when one has tasted an apple or a vegetable and left  the                           it,
other lays hold of        thing that often happens with them.
                             it ;   a
   This character of gentleness indicates the social affections,
and we know, in fact, that the ateles live in troops.       In                             a
savage     state they feed at first on fruits,             preferring such as
belong to the palm tree                  ; they afterwards eat vegetables and
small animals,           such       as    worms and insects.         also said
                                                                     It   is
that with the assistance of their tail they fish extremely well
for crab fish and other kinds of shell fish, and that they arc
by    no means at        a   loss for        a   method of breaking the shells.
  We did not remark                   that       our ateles made any uncommon
use of their tail, nor did they ever seize their food with                                it;
for this purpose they use their hands, and they do       in an                 it
awkward manner to appearance,                          but really with great ad
dress.
   The ateles, when left to their natural impulse, evince
boldness and courage they fight together often, and very
                                  ;
bitterly   ;   said that they come to the assistance of eacfi

  Dampier relates the ingenious manner in which these ani
mals cross river when there are trees on each side of
                a                                                                         it:
one    of them hangs            by   the tail to one     of   the highest branches,
and the others attach                    themselves to this one      by   their tatls       :
they then begin to swing themselves across the river until
the one at the lower extremity catches hold of the opposite
tree  and when he has laid hold of
      ;                                 he climbs up to the

hold, and thus the whole chain swings across the river.

    tion given by this gentleman represent the full-bottomed
    monkey with all the characteristics of our guenous, and it
    is asserted that they come from the same place ; but, on the
    other hand, Boddaert ascribes             to the latter, among other
    characters, that of  prehensile tail.
                              a                    At first sight one is al
    most inclined to recognise this ape             as an atele,     And to sup
    pose that Pennant has been deceived  by inaccurate informa
    tion, when he ascribes his species to Guinea, and talks of
    the high value attached by the negroes to their skin, which,
    according to his account, forms            OTIC     of   the most costly ar
    ticles of dress.
      Admitting         the existence      of this latter      species,   this new
    genus, of the        general     characters and habitudes of which              I
    have presented a view, would be composed of five species,
    viz. the chamek, the coaita, the ape of Brown, the belze-
    but, and the full-bottom    of Pennant.    The following are
    the distinguishing characters of each :
       1. The chamek.    It has never yet been distinguished from
    the coaita, nor is it even described as distinct by Buflbn.
    This ape, which came from the coast of Bancet, in Pern,
    was presented to him alive some years before he began to
    write the last volume of his History of Quadrupeds. M. Buf-
    fon intrusted his draftsman with talcing a drawing of which           it,
    lie did very minutely.   Having afterwards compared this de
    scription with that of the coaita   M. Daubenton, and hav
                                               by
    ing found them different in some respects, he thought proper
    to publish them both, without renouncing the opinion he
    entertained, that the chamek and the coaita were one and the
    same animal.
        The   carcase   of this chamek       was not preserved        in the mu
    seum  ;  but we possess another which was taken at Guiana,
    and for which we are indebted to the enlightened zeal and
    indefatigable activity of M. Martin, botanist to the govern
    ment of Cayenne.                took this carcase, upon its arrival, fcr

to consider them                      as    two distinct species                        ;    and in order to
verify my first opinion on this subject, 1 took the cranium
from the carcase sent to me by M. Martin, in order to com
pare       it with that              of    the coaita.            These two crania appeared
to me to be sensibly different :                                that of the chamek is larger,
shorter, flatter towards the suture of the parietal bones, and
more swelled at the temples. The coronal bone is a little
depressed                 sides, in such a manner that the
                      towards the
chamek has a slight tuft ; the forehead of the coaita, on the
contrary, is perfectly rounded. The lower jaw is in particular
much longer; its lower edge is straight, while it is arched
in            lastly, the ascending branches of it are so ex
      the coaita           :
tended that we are led to think that they might, as in the
alouati, serve                 as a   kind of partition                     to a hyoidal bone with a
cavernous base.
     The thumb is very different in the two species : in the coaita
the metacarpal   bone is, for the most part, as long as the half
of its neighbouring one,                              and the phalange that terminates                           it
is so small, that it only                             forms        a   fifth part           of   the length    of
this first bone                 ; these       two bones are slender in proportion,
so that they are lost in the common                         integuments, without
showing any traces externally.   In the chamek there are the
same bones : the principal difference is in their thickness;
                                             is is,
the       metacarpal             bone                 besides,                 little longer.           The first
                                                        third of        it a
and the only phalange        longer;     makes nearly                                                  a
it;   it    much larger, particularly towards the extremity.
           is                                                                                                  It
is    this phalange which, detaching itself from (he second
metacarpal             bone, constitutes                        the thumb                   of   the    chamek   ;
we     see       it   is   very short,            and that               not complete, inso
                                                                        it     is
much        as   it   wants the second                          phalange, and the nail which
terminates the latter in all the other apes.
   The chamek      generally    little different from the coaita
                                is                        a                                                      ;
it   is   covered, like the latter, with  rough and coarse hair,
dry,      and
            deep  ablack    its  face    naked
                                             ;  and of      mulish     is                              a
colour, as well as the ears     the iris of the eye   ; brown, and                               is

head.       There is no difference in the shape and proportions
of     the chamek from those of the coaita.
      The following description               agrees with the chamek     :   ATE-
LKS PENTADACTYLUS                ; ateles      niger, palmis pentadactylis.
     2. The coaita.           This   is the    only species of this genus that
has been established in a precise manner:                     Buffbn and Dau-
benton were the first to publish a good description and a
drawing of it. Linnaeus afterwards made his simia panisats
of it. M. d'Azzara has latterly proposed to join it with th«
orang, regarding it as the male of this jumping ape ; but we
are certain that these animals even belong to two different
genera.      The coaita          had    been     seen long before by Barrere
and Edwards ; since then                M. Vosmaer         has'   given us a new
drawing and a long description,            it is of this ape he
                                                 because
speaks when he describes it by the name of the devil of the
woods, or the American jumping and whistling ape.        Audi-
bert, in his History of Apes, has also given a new drawing of
it. These two latter authors charge Buffbn's plate with repre
senting the coaita with an excessive slenderness : I think his
plate, however, as faithful as theirs. I have seen coaitas
which resemble it completely ; I have also seen others that
were squatter : of this number is the individual sent by
M.     Leblond      to the Society of Natural History, and which
at present       forms part of the collection of M. Dufresne at
the head of the zoological cabinet in the Museum                      of Natural
History.
   Ishall not repeat what I have said above of the characters
by which it differs from the chamek : I shall only add that
the coaita has a clear copper-coloured face. It is sufficiently
distinguished         from     preceding species by the following
                               the
description       :   ATELES PANISCUS ; aides niger, palmis tetra~
dactylis.    .
  3. The arachnoides.  I give this name to the brown atele,
and I borrow    in some measure, from Edwards, who re
                      it,
lates that    was exhibited some time ago in London hy the
             it
name of the spider monkey        description which principally
                                       ;   a
relates to the length and the slenderness of the limbs of this
atele.     Edwards also saw            a   coaita about the same time        ;   so
that when he speaks of the colour                   of this   ape he could not
                                                                             have

          Memoir          upon the Apes          with imperfect Hands.                         11
have      been      mistaken.        Brown (History of Jamaica) also
speaks        of   an ape    with tetradactylous hands, the skin of which
is brown,           and strong and muscular.
                           the     tail           It is upon
these two authorities that I class this speries in the cata
logue of the mammiferae ; and I am besides led to do so, be
cause I have not 3et seen what may be regarded as a young
or   a female       atele.        It   also seems that in point               of   shape they
do not differ.
   Brown only mentions a few of its habits, which we have
already repeated.  He adds that it exists in the continent of
America, and that it furnishes the greatest part of the food
of the Indians. It may be thus described : ATELES ARACH-
NOIDES         ;   ateles fuscus,          palmis tetradactylis.
     4.   The        belzebut.             Brisson described                it,    but    it   has
been      since forgotten.                 It   has   a    round   head, the muzzle
lengthened and prominent; the ears like those of    man                                  a      ;
the eyes black; the pupils of flesh colour, which makes
                                                 a                                              a
singular contrast with the rest of the figure of   red or                            a
blackish brown; its lips are capable of great extension,                                       and
furnished, like the chin, with white hairs.
     The direction of the hairs is, in                      some respects,               different
from that which exists                     in   the coaita and chauiek.                   On   the
forehead they lie forwards, and they meet    opposition wiih           in
those in front; the tufts of the cheeks incline towards the
ears,     andpartly conceal them   they are directed upwards
                                                      :
on the neck      on the abdomen they are directed downwards,
                    ;
and    little inclined to one side; on the lower belly they
          a
are quite rough,             which results from               the crouching              position
in which they sit             so often      ;   the hairs     of   the fore-arm have             a
similar direction to that which we remark in the orang ou-
tang.
     The hairs                     little deeper upon the bot
                          are black above,            a
tom, dirty white
          a         under the belly of our young subjects, and
of yellowish white in (he adult, according to Brisson.
     a                                                                                          A
straight and red line indicates upon the whole length of the
flanks the meeting of the hairs of the upper parts with those
of the abdomen.
     The naked             part   of      the tail    is   flattened    and        transversi-ly
 ridged, but without callosities.

       Observation. —The simia belzebut of Linnaeus must not
    be confounded with our belzebut,                          which    is the same              with
    the ouarine   of Buffon.               I
                                      propose giving to this species the
    name of the guariba,           which it bears in the Brasils, or at
    least in the work of Marcgrave, the only author who has
    spoken of the visa. The caraya of M. d'Azzara seems to
    me to be different from                it,   as well as the alouati(simia seni-
    ctilus).    These three species                  will constitute the genus of
                           •
    leapers (hurleurs).
       In the work of Marcgrave the figures                           of   the guariba and
    the exquima have been transposed.                          That

II.   Account of the Success of the American Expedition of
    Discovery under the Command of' Captain LEWIS: com
    municated in a Letter from Captain CLARK to his Brollier
    General CLARK.
         DEAR BKOTHER,                            St. Louis,  Sept. 2.1, 180G.
      E arrived    at this place    at twelve o'clock         to-day from
the Pacific Ocean, \vhere we remained during the last winter,
near the entrance     of the Columbia river. This station we left
on the   27th of March last, and should^ have reached Saint
Louis   early in August     had we not been detained         by the snow,
which barred our passage across the Rocky Mountains until
the 34th of June.          In returning through those mountains
we divided ourselves into several parties, digressing from the
route by which we went out, in order the more effectually
to explore the country, and discover the most practicable
route which does exist across the continent by the way of
the Missouri and Columbia rivers.            In this we were com
pletely successful, and have therefore no hesitation in de
claring,    that, such  as  nature has permitted, we have disco
vered the best route which does exist across the continent of
North America in that direction.            Such is that        by way       of
the Missouri to the foot of the rapids below the                great falls
of that river, a distance of 2575 miles ; thence by land pass
ing by the Rocky Mountains to a navigable part of the Koos-
kooske, 340 : and with the Kooskooske 73 miles, Lewis's
                                                                         river

 river 154 miles, and the Columbia 413 miles to the Pacific
 Ocean ; making the total distance from the confluence of
 the Missouri and Mississippi to the discharge of the Co
 lumbia into the Pacific Ocean 3554 miles.                       The navigation
 of   the   Missouri may        be deemed good         ;    its difficulties arise
from its falling banks, timber embedded in the mud of its
channels, its sand-bars, and steady rapidity of its current ;
all which may be overcome, with a great degree of certainty,
by using the necessary precautions.  The passage by land
of 340 miles, from the falls of the Missouri to the Koos-
kooske, is the most formidable             part   of       the   track proposed
across the continent.           Of this distance 200 miles             is along
a good      road, and     140 miles      over tremendous mountains,
which for 60 miles are covered with eternal snows.                       A   pas
sage over these mountains          is,   however, practicable from the
latter part of June to the last of September and the cheap   ;
rate at which horses are to be obtained from the Indians of
the Rocky Mountains, and west of them, reduces the ex
penses of transportation over this portage to mere trifle.        a

river   ;the first of which, in descending,    1200 paces at the
                                                       is
falls of Columbia, 261 miles up that river; the second, of
two miles, at the Long Narrows, six miles below the falls;
and   a third, also of two miles, at the Great Rapids, 65 miles
still lower down.       The tide flows up the Columbia 183
miles, and within seven miles of the Great Rapids.        Large
sloops may with safety ascend as high as tide water, and ves
sels of 300 tons burthen reach the entrance of the Multno-
mah river,     a    large southern branch     of Columbia, which
                                                   the
takes     its rise on the confines of New Mexico, with the Cal-
lerado      and Apostle's rivers, discharging itself into the Co
lumbia, 125 miles from its entrance into the Pacific Ocean.
I consider this track across the continent of immense advan
tage to the fur trade, as all the furs collected                 in nine-tenths
of the most valuable fur country in America may be con
veyed to the mouth of the Columbia, and shipped from

    In our outward bound      voyage we ascended      to the foot  of
the rapids below the great falls  of the  Missouri, where we ar
rived on the 14th of June 1805.         Not having met with any
of the natives of   the Kocky Mountains, we were, of course,
ignorant of the    passes by land which     existed  through these
mountains to the Columbia river       ;  and had we even known
the route, we were destitute of horses, which           would   have
been indispensably necessary to enable us to transport the
requisite quantity of ammunition and other stores to ensure
the remaining part of our royage down the Columbia : we
therefore determined to navigate the Missouri as far as it
was practicable, or unless we met with some of the natives,
from whom we could obtain horses, and information of the
country.      Accordingly, we took a most laborious portage at
the fall  of the Missouri, of  18 milee, which we effected with
our canoes     and baggage   by the 3d    of July.    From thence,
ascending the Missouri, we penetrated the Rocky Mountain
at the distance of 71 miles above the upper part of the
portage, and penetrated as far as the three forks of that
river,   a distance  of 180 miles further.       Here the Missouri
divides into three nearly equal branches at the same point :
the two largest branches are so nearly of the same dignity
that we did not conceive that either of them could, with
 propriety, retain the name of the Missouri ; and therefore
 called these streams Jefferson's, Madison's, and Gallatin's
 rivers.   The confluence of these rivers is 3848 miles from
 (he mouth of the Missouri by the meanders of that river.
We arrived at the three forks of the Missouri on the 27th
 of July. Not having yet been so fortunate as to meet with
 the natives, although I had previously made several exer
 tions for that purpose, we were compelled to continue our
 route by water.
    The most northerly of the three forks, that         to which we
 have given the name of Jefferson's river, was           deemed   the
 most proper for our purposes, and we accordingly ascended
it 248 miles, to the upper forks, and its extreme navigable
                                                               point.

                            ^
  point.    On the morning of the l7th of August 1805, I ar
  rived at the forks of Jefferson's river, where I met captain
  Lewis, who had previously penetrated, with a party of three
  men, to the waters       of the Columbia, discovered       a hand   of
  the Shosshone nation, and had found means           to induce 35    of
  their chiefs and     warriors  to accompany him to that place.
  From   these  people    we learned   that the river on which they
 resided   was    not navigable, and that      a passage  through the
 mountains in that direction was impracticable.             Being un
 willing to confidf in this unfavourable account           of  the  na
 tives, it was concerted between captain Lewis and myself,
 that one of us should go forward immediately with a small
 party and explore the river, while the other, in the interim,
 would lay up the canoes at that place, and engage the na
 tives with their horses to assist in transporting our stores
 and baggage      to their camp.   Accordingly I     set out the next
 day, passtd the dividing mountains between the waters of
 the Missouri and Columbia, and descended the river, which
 I since called the East fork of Lewis's river, about 70 miles.
 Finding   that- the Indians'   account   of  the country   in the di
rection of that river was correct,       I returned  and joined    cap
 tain Lewis on August 29, at the Shosshone camp, excessively
 fatigued, as you may suppose, having passed mountains al
most inaccessible, and compelled to subsist on berries during
the greater part of my route. We now purchased seventeen
 horses of the Indians, and hired a guide, who assured us
that he could in fifteen days take us to a large river, hi au
open country west of these mountains, by a route some di
stance to the north of the river on which they lived, and
that by which the natives west of the mountains visit the
plain of the Missouri for the purpose of hunting the buffalo.
Every preparation being made, we set forward with our guide
on the 31st    of August through     these tremendous mountains,
in which    we continued till the 22d      of September before we
reached    the   lower country beyond them.          On our way we
met with the      Olelachshook, a band of the Tuchapaks, from
whom we obtained an accession             of  seven  horses, and ex
changed eight or ten others : this proved an infinite service
to us, as we were compelled to subsist orr horse beef about
                                                                 eight

                American Expedition       of Discovery.              17
eight days before we reached the Kooskooske.              During our
passage over these mountains we suffered every thing which
hunger, cold, and fatigue, could impose: nor did our dif
ficulties terminate on our arrival at the Kooskooske         ;  for al
though the Pollotepallors,      a numerous nation inhabiting that
country, were extremely hospitable, and for a few trifling
articles furnished us with an abundance of roots ancl dried
salmon, the food to which they were accustomed, we found
that we could not subsist on these articles, and almost all of
us grew sick on eating (hem          :  we were obliged, therefore,
to have     recourse  to the flesh  of horses and dogs, as food to
supply the deficiency     of our guns, which produced but little
meat,    as game was    scarce in the vicinity of our camp on the
Kooskooske,       where we were compelled to remain, in order
to construct our perogues to descend the river.          At this sea
son the salmon are meagre, and form but indifferent food.
While we remained here I was myself sick for several days,
and my friend captain      Lewis   suffered a severe indisposition.
    Having completed four perogues and a small canoe, we
gave cur horses in charge to the Pollotepallors until we re
turned, and on the 7th of October re-embarked for the Pa
cific Ocean.      We   descended    by the route     I  have   already
mentioned.       The water of  the river being low at this season,
we experienced much difficulty in descending: we found it
obstructed by a great number of difficult and dangerous ra
pids, in passing of which       our perogues several times filled,
and the men escaped narrowly          with their lives. However,
this difficulty does not exist in high water, which happens
within the period which I have previously mentioned.               We
found the natives extremely numerous, and generally friendly,
though we have on several occasions owed our lives and the
fate  of the expedition to our number, which consisted of
thirty-one men.       On the 17th of November we reached the
ocean, where various considerations induced us to spend the
winter : we therefore searched for an eligible situation for
that purpose, and selected a spot on the south side of a little
river called    by the natives    Netat,    which  discharges itself
at a small bar on the south side       of the Columbia,    and four
teen miles    within point Adams.        Here we constructed some

log-houses, and defended them with a common                                 stockade-

that name who were our nearest neighbours. In this coun
try we found an abundance of elk, on which we subsisted
principally during the last winter. We left Fort Clatsop on
the 27th of March. On our homeward bound voyage, being
much better acquainted with the country, we were enabled
to take such precautions as in a great measure secured us
from the want of provision at any time, and greatly lessened
our fatigues, when compared with those to which we were
compelled to submit in our outward-bound journey.       We
have net lost a man since we left the Mandians ; a circum
stance which       I   you is a pleasing consideration to me.

shall    adopt the author's own language.
   Several       chemists    successively occupied themselves
                                 have
with     the examination of coffee; but as the methods of ana
lysis formerly employed had not arrived at that degree of
perfection to which modern chemistry has raised them by
its numerous discoveries,  thought of resuming the subject,

perfluous to relate the different results obtained from each
analysis.    shall therefore confine myself to pointing out
                I
those of the most recent           authors who have taken up the
subject, such            Ryhiner

Geoffrey,         and shall afterwards detail my own observations
resulting from actual experiments.
   Being desirous of knowing the particular principle newly

seen, however, that my results do not always agree with
those of M. Chenevix, and that, in place of   principle in                  a
which he seems to have discovered nothing at all acid,                                       I

precipitate nor change of              colour different from that which is
natural to the mixture of the two liquors.
  A quantity of coffee equal to that above                           employed was
pulverized, and boiled repeatedly                       like the foregoing in three
times its weight of pure water, in order to convince myself
that the husks were completely exhausted : the second and
third decoctions gave a greenish appearance deeper than the
first, without my being able to ascertain positively the cause
of this slight difference. I merely presumed that, the latter
decoctions being made in the open air, the extractive matter
had been able to oxygenate itself sufficiently, and to pro
duce this effect without precipitating it. These decoctions
always maintain             a   muddy appearance,              in spite       of   repeated
filtrations.
    All   these liquors united were                     submitted to evaporation in
a glass    retort so managed                 as   to avoid the      contact          of the
air, and consequently the oxygenation of the extract. Con
densed to the consistence of a syrup slightly boiled, I fimshed
their evaporation in a glass capsule. This production be
came transparent in proportion                        as  it acquired consistence,
and viscous         like   an extract    :    its colour was that      of horn, of
a   bitter acid taste mixed with a                    degree of roughness which
I   do not know            how to describe, and it reddened                        the blue
colours:      its weight was 15-216 (4 drachms), which I put
aside     for the purpose of being examined, as we shall see
hereafter.
    Sixty-one grammes              143 milligrammes         (9 ounces) of cef-
fcc in powder were digested                  in a glass vessel with 12-2 gram
mes 280 milligrammes    (4 ounces) of alcohol, giving 34 de
grees at Batumi's areometer : I filtered, after two hours' ma

\tai highly coloured       ; when evaporated it gave                      a    product    of

  presented       phaenomena         very analogous to those    of the decoc
  tion  ;  I  say analogous, because            the decomposition     of some
  of  them appeared            to have taken place more slowly and less
  completely        ;   which made me presume that the presence of
  the greater         quantity of extractive matter than the decoction
  contains was one              of  the causes   which facilitated these de
  compositions, and increased the                quantity of the precipitates.
  We shall return to this subject : this solution was moreover
  mixed with certain other re-agents, of which it is interesting
  to ascertain the action.               ,
     With       the prussiate         of iron and crystallized potash dis
  solved, the mixture             of the liquor gave a green colour; with
  the prussiate of ammonia, a yellow colour; with the prussic
  acid, a colour slightly gray.
     The preceding experiments only proving the existence of
  an acid combined,              or simply mixed with foreign matters,
  which might             perhaps have occasioned some of the pheno
  mena observed,             it became     important to verify the processes
  employed hy           Mr. Chenevix (who has not ascertained the pre
  sence   of     the     acid I remarked) ; and, in short, to take away
  every kind of uncertainty upon this matter by endeavouring
  to obtain it by the processes of the English chemist.
      I boiled, in a glass alembic in a sand bath, 489 grammes 146
  milligrammes (1 pound) of Martinique coffee, reduced into
  powder, in three times its weight of distilled water for about
  two hours       : the water, when filtered,      I replaced upon the husks
  as they were condensed               in the distillation,  with an addition
  of about       a    kilogramme of the same liquid. The operation
  being finished, I filtered and mixed the two liquors ; I then
  poured muriate of tin, crystallized and dissolved in pure
  •water, until no more precipitate was formed : I passed the
'
  whole through a filter, washed the husks remaining upon the
  paper in several waters, and afterwards introduced the whole
  into a flask with two apertures, with six times its weight of
  water : having carefully agitated the mixture,- I introduced,
  hy means of a suitable apparatus, sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
  which     passed        slowly through the liquor. The decomposi
  tion of    the compound          of tin and the acid of coffee was easily
  eflected    ;   the new combination of the hydrosulphuret of tin
                                                                          was

                          Memoir    vfion Coffee.                     23
was mamfested        in the form of       a white precipitate, which I
had the precaution to shake frequently with a glass tube, in
order to make it present a greater surface anil more points
of contact   to the hydrogen gas saturated          with sulphur.   The
operation being finished, I       unluted the apparatus and filtered
the liquor of the ilask, which passed very limpid, preserv
ing, however, a slight smell of sulphuretted hydrogen.                  I
 proceeded   to evaporate    it in  a   glass capsule, with    a  mode
rate heat:    the liquor,    when reduced to one- third       of its vo
lume,    no  longer retained       the   hydrosulphuretted smell.       I
continued the evaporation in order to give to the liquid a
pretty strong syrupy consistence: when brought to this point
it  was very transparent and of the colour of horu, as ob
served by Mr. Chencvix.            In this state it was submitted to
the following experiments:                       •
    Applied    to the tongue,     its bitter taste was mixed with an
acidity and a roughness of which we have already spoken ;
mixing itself with water and even alcohol in any propor
tions;    presenting no crystallization in spite of the care
taken in its evaporation ; liquefying in the (ire, and after
wards swelling very lightly; spreading a sharp and pungent
whitish smoke; leaving as a residue a charry matter, not
voluminous,       and very slightly salt.
    I afterwards submitted       the acid thus collected to an ana
lysis by fire in close vessels.        For this purpose I introduced
 100 parts   of it into    a  glass   retort, to which I adapted the
hydro- pneumatic tub and an intermediate flask with two
necks: the first product which appeared was only water ;
this was coloured in proportion as I augmented the fire
under    the   distillatory vessel, and during this time there
passed into the flask a little oil highly coloured and very
fetid : upon raising the temperature still higher, I succeeded
in liberating    some cubic inches of carbonic acid gas and car
bonated hydrogen ga*. When there was no more disengaged,
I  put out the fire and unluted the apparatus : when the re
tort   was broken      I found   a   charcoal weighing 0-36 : made
red-hot in a platina crucible for an hoar, it was impossible
to incinerate it.; heated with the blow -pipe it lost in weight,
and   a very  small portion      of it    was   incinerated ; yet it was
                                   B 4                       impossible,- ^

   impossible, on account of its small quantity, to determine
   the nature of this residue, which was black inclining to
   gray.
      The liquid product contained in the receiver contained
  in all 0-45 of the mass distilled ; whence I concluded that
  the amount of the gas formed during the operation was
  nearly o-;o.         The empyrcumatic oil separated from the
  aqueous      liquid,  and a little soapy, weighed 0'15 ;      the water
  0-30.
      The acid of       coffee   which    I obtained pure  was dissolved
  in six times its weight of pure water ; in this -state it
  was mixed with the following substances : with turnsole
  and violet tinctures, which it reddened very suddenly ; with
  solutions of oxygenated and green sulphate of iron, the
 former solution          immediately assumed a fine green colour,
  and after resting six hours there was a precipitate formed of
 the same colour; the latter solution at first only assumed an
 extremely slight green tint, but this became deeper upon
 being exposed some hours to the air. Gelatine was not pre
 cipitated by the acid of coffee; the muriates of tin and
 lead    were     precipitated very suddenly and very abundantly
in grayish white; muriate of antimony in a flaky white,
very suddenly ; the nitrates of mercury and bismuth in dirty
white ; the nitrate and acetite of copper in a sombre brown;
the nitrates of silver and cobalt, the sulphates of manganese,
zinc, and copper, underwent no alteration ; that of copper
only lost in colour; the nitro-muriates             of gold   and platina
lost nothing, not even their colour.
     The    actio-a  of  the sulphuric,    sulphurous,   nitric, nitrous,
muriatic,       oxymuriatic,      and phosphoric acids    only gave this
vegetable       acid  a    yellow   tint more or less beautiful in the
cold   ;  by  heating     them    mixed, the sulphuric acid became
hiahly coloured, and liberated vapours of sulphurous acid ;
the nitric acid was easily decomposed with a disengagement
of    gaseous oxide       of azote and carbonic acid, which preci
pitated    lime   water.     The residue of this kind of combustion,
subjected to some trials, seemed to me to be only malic ncirl,
not precipitating lime from its combinations like the oxalic,
       oxvmuriatic acid gave          a similar product.

      Among     the vegetable     acids, the malic, oxalic,             and tarta-
  rous, only gave,        on their mixture with          the   acid     of coffee,
  a clear yellow tint to the latter.
      The  pure or saturated      alkalis of potash, soda, and ammo
  nia, only gave       as &   product mixtures of a deep yellow in
  clining to orange.
      Lime, barytes, strontian,          and the hydrosulphurets,               pre
  sented,    upon being mixed with this acid, phaenomena                       little
  different from those of the alkalis.
     Among saline        substances     the   prussiate of ammonia gives
  a product similar to that        of  the alkalis.
     The prussiate of iron and potash develop a slight green
  tint, which indicates the decomposition of the little prus
  siate of iron that this re-agent always contains.
     Sulphate of alumine, acetite of barytes, and the nitrate
 of this latter       base, are partly precipitated in white powder
 by   this acid,   after   the mixture of these liquids has remained
 some time at rest.
     Tannin, as well as galhted alcohol, are sensibly disco
 loured on mixture with the acid of coffee*.
     After having determined         the chemical action          of  the acid     of
 coffee upon the different re-agents which we have here enu
 merated, it was necessary to inquire among the known ve
 getable acids for that which presented the greatest analogy
 with the former acid. We first examined gallic acid, and
 afterwards the tanning principle ; but we shall see, by com
 paring the most characteristic properties of these latter, that
 we cannot be permitted to establish an identity                  of a physical
or chemical nature between            them and the acid which is the
subject of our present inquiry.
     Tannin, very pure, precipitates in black the solution of
sulphate of oxygenated iron; the acid of coffee communi
cates a green       tint to it  : the latter does not precipitate gela
tine; while this         is the   most remarkable characteristic of
tannin,     and    whieh would        of itself suffice to establish the
difference whieh exists between these two bodies, if there

\cas     not a crowd of other distinctions,                     which it would be
superfluous to relate here.
   As to the gallic acid and that of coffee, the former preci
pitates in black the sulphate of iron : it is very soluble
m water;   it precipitates solutions of gold and silver in
brown, those of bismuth and mercury in yellow ; and causes
no change in that of the green sulphate of iron ; while the
acid    of   coffee    gives       to this last       a very sensible         green   tint,
and precipitates the iron from it in the same colour on ex
posure to the air; it gives precipitates of a dirty white with
the nitrates  of mercury and bismuth, without causing any
change   in the solutions of gold and platina.
   The existence of an acid in coffee being once well demon
strated, it only remains to know in what proportions it does
exist, what are the combinations it is capable of forming ;
and, in one wprd, the order it follows in its chemical attrac
tions.
   In order to attain these branches of knowledge I treated
2000 parts of coffee of the above species, and prepared as
above described, with a sufficient quantity of pure water,
by various decoctions and in close vessels.    The extract,
brouirht to the consistence of honey, was 280 parts : I took
100 parts of ihis and dissolved them in six times their weight
of pure water; I afterwards proceeded, as already pointed
out, \\ith        muriate      of tin,     and    decomposed the new com
bination by sulphuretted hydrogen.       This operation fur
nished, alter having suitably evaporated the liquor contain
ing the acid of codec, 0-55 of this matter. Wishing to know
the substances         with which it was combined in the extract                        of
i-offce,   I took     100 fresh parts        of   it,   which   I   dissolved in an
equal quantity of water, upon which solution      poured as              I
much highly rectified alcohol    at the same instant the
                                             ;                                        li

              decanting the liquid. This deposit stuck to

  In order to ascertain the quantity of extract which                                           the
aqueous       and alcoholic            liquor contained,            I    evaporated         it   to

0-83.    I        deducted       from          this quantity that of the acid, the
weight of which              I   knew      :    that of the extract was then re

mine the composition of the coffee from which                                    I    had sepa
rated the extract and the acid, &c.
      We   have seen that the 2000 parts lost 2S0 by the different
decoctions they had undergone                      ;   and the residue was conse
quently reduced to 1 720. I endeavoured to incinerate it
by burning it in a Hessian crucible, which I kept red-hot
for an hour : the matter began, at first, to spread a pungent
smoke, which           the eyes; inflammation afterwards
                           affected
took place, and the matter burned in this manner during
some minutes.   The residue of this operation was a very
black charcoal, weighing 430 parts; it was reduced into
powder and put into a platina crucible, which [ kept red-
hot for two hours in               a   reverberating furnace.                    It   was    only
in .this manner that I succeeded in reducing it to ashes,
but still in an imperfect manner, since of 322 parts, which
the crucible contained after calcination. 230 only were con
verted     into ashes       ;   92 parts      of   a charry matter remaining,
which      refused        all attempts        at incineration.   I poured 200
parts of water upon 230 of                 ashes, and filtered and evaporated
the liquor: it furnished as   a product ten parts of a saline
substance, precipitated the nitrate of silver in a flaky muriate,
and which I recognised, after examining            to be nothing       it,
cbe than muriate   of potash.
    The residue          was saturated        with nitric acid, which entered
into combination with                 a   slight       effervescence,          and        without
kaving any           residue.    I     decomposed            the nitrate formed                by
the carbonate of potash, and collected' the precipitate upon
a filter; was carefully washed, and calcined in

parts of   which, added to the ten of the alkaline muriate,
              it,
yielded 226, from which the loss must have amounted to
four parts.   The taste of this earthy substance was caustic
and burning, absorbing water greedily, and with         disen                         a

indicated the presence of an atom of iron; the gallated al
 cohol acted in the same manner, by communicating to the
solution of this salt a purple colour.
   Being desirous of knowing        the products which coffee    not
boiled in water would furnish by its decomposition, I re
duced 200 parts of it into a rough powder, which I intro
duced into a glass retort, to which I joined a tubulated ma
trass, communicating       by means of a tube with the hydro-
pneumatic tub.      The first portions of liquid which passed
into the matrass     after the apparatus was heated were only
a white limpid liquid, which became brown in proportion
as I augmented the heat : to this first product succeeded a
citrine  oil slightly   fetid, which became     black and thicker
on the temperature      being raised.    Towards   the end   of  the
operation there was sublimed into the neck, of the retort a
saline matter, confusedly crystallized, mixed with black ein-
pyrcumatic oil : I then augmented the fire until the bottom
of  the  retort was reddened,       in the hope of liberating some
gaseous   substances   ; but   I  did not succeed : so that from
this  I was led to believe, that the principles    of which   coffee
is composed, and which are disengaged by fire, are combined
in a state different from that in which they exist in the
grain, and that the proportions of each of them are exactly
those which ought to form the ammonia, carbonic acid, oil,
water, and pyromucous acid, which are the products of this
operation.    The retort was broken : it contained a charcoal
occupying all the capacity of the vessel ; it appeared deco
rated with the most brilliant colours, and of various hues          ;
the lead gray with the metallic aspect was very distinct to
wards that part which touched the bottom of the retort; its
weight was 50 parts.
   The liquid contained in the matrass was composed, as
we have said, of thick black oil, very much charred, and of
a, brownish    liquid, fetid and astringent : its total weight,
isolated from the oil, was 88 parts ; that of the oil was 33.
The neck of the retort still contained a sublimed saline mat
ter, of a fetid ammoniacal smell, weighing 22 parts, and
which was only carbonate of ammonia : the loss was seven.

    The astringent liquid tried with turnsole tincture made it
 quickly become red: solution of sulphate of oxygenated
 iron acquired a very slight green colour : the muriates of tin
 and lead were but very slightly precipitated : but in some
 other trials I made comparatively with pyromucous acid
it  presented  the characters of the latter ; from which     I in
ferred that a portion of the acid of coffee was disengaged
during the distillation without experiencing any alteration,
and that it was mixed with the pyroraucous acid.            After
having determined the proportion of the principles which
appeared to me to compose coffee, I thought it necessary to
examine if heat developed tannin in this grain, as Mr. Che-
nevix asserted.    In order  to convince myself of this I roasted
some Martinique     coffee  until it was of a chestnut brown;
after having reduced it into powder, a portion was infused
in boiling distilled water, and a second was treated by the
same vehicle and by decoction.         These two liquors filtered
were tried each separately with gelatine, but they gave no
kind of precipitate which could indicate the presence of the
tanning principle.
    The difference between      these  results and those   of  the
London chemist induced me to roast the coffee more
strongly.     After it was treated, like the former, by infu
sion, decoction, and mixed with the solution of glue, there
did not even result any change in the transparency of the
liquor. Not confining myself to this second experiment, I
roasted some new coffee until it was of a brownish black,
and at the same time examined all the species known in
commerce under the names of Java, Bourbon, St. Domingo,
Martinique, Moka, Sec.; but none of them gave me any
proofs of the existence of tannin treated as we have de
scribed.    Each  of  these infusions and decoctions constantly
reddened    the  blue vegetable tinctures; it precipitated, in
fawn colour, the muriates of tin and lead ; in green, the sul
phate of oxygenated iron ; in brown, the sulphate of copper;
and in chocolate colour, the nitrate     of mercury.    The pure
and carbonated alkalis, barytes, lime,      and the hydrosulphu-
rets, communicated to these infusions       and decoctions a very
deep saffron-yellow     colour; which    led me to suppose    that

a part    of  the acid   of coffee existed in them free, merely en
tangled in a little extractive matter and         a good deal of char
coal.
     It remained, in order to render this analysis more com
plete, to consider the pure acid of coffee with respect to its
chemical attractions for the different known bases.               I ob
served,     after a  multiplicity of experiments, that the metallic
oxides were the bodies which combined the most intimately;
those of tin, lead, mercury, iron, antimony, bismuth, and
copper, precipitated from their solutions or put in contact
with this acid, on aiding its action by heat, were there com
 bined, and formed saline compounds,            of  an austere and me
 tallic taste in general, not crystallizable, pulverulent, and little
 soluble in water      ;  that of mercury was, however, dissolved
 in about      1 60 parts  of this liquid, combining itself with and
 precipitating      several  colouring matters, which fix very so
 lidly, particularly      when    stuffs are impregnated and boiled
 with the compounds so formed with tin, lead, antimony,
  and alumine.        The colouring particles of saffron, of yellow
 wood, madder, sorrel, and of some pharmaceutical extracts,
  Sec., are those which have proved to me that this new mor
  dant may become useful in the art of dyeing.             All these sa
  line combinations are decomposable by fire ; but more easily
  by sulphuric acid; those of iron, tin, and antimony, ex-
  cepted. The nitric acid decomposes only the combination
  which the acid of coffee forms with copper.
      The earthy substances also form saline compounds with
  the acid    of coffee ; alumine is that which seemed to unite
  most easily ; this combination, which is not very soluble,
  has a slightly saccharine and astringent taste,         always pulve
   rulent, and fixing some colours.          Lime, barytes, strontian,
   and magnesia, combine with it also : the last of these earths
   adheres to it only very feebly.
       Potash, soda, and ammonia,          form compounds extremely
   soluble, of a bitter taste, little crystallizable, and decom
   posable by a slight heat, of a colour always yellow, which
   becomes     brown upon heating it too long.
      The muriates of tin and lead dissolved in water, speedily
    decompose these salts, as does also sulphuric acid, which,
                  4                                             however,

however, does not act, upon that of alumine. The nitric^
muriatic,and phosphoric acids decompose them also in a.
great measure   it happens at the same time that the acid of
                          ;
               changed into malic acid by the nitric, after
coffee is itself
the latter has been isolated from its union with the bases,
in such          a   manner that        a malate   and nitrate is obtained, as          I
was convinced by thus decomposing the cafiate of lime.
                                         Conclusion.
     1.     It   results from all that precedes,         that coffee contains a
particular acid, very distinctly characterized ; that it there
enjoys a sort of liberty, since the powder of this grain sud
denly reddens the blue vegetable tinctures ; and that infu
sions in cold water, and even in alcohol,                        may   be separated
from the acid in a state more or less pure.
    2. That the acid decoction of coffee decomposes with fa
cility almost all the metallic solutions, particularly those of
lead,       tin, iron,        &c*
  3. That the precipitates obtained by the mixture of this
decoction and metallic solutions, are more abundant and
more highlv coloured than those formed by the same acid
in a pure state ; that this difference, I say, proceeds from
two causes,             which must         be considered     :   first, because    the
decoction of coffee,                besides   the caffic acid it contains,        con
tains also extractive matter, colouring matter, albumen, &c.;
that the colouring matter is partly precipitated by the affinity
it   has with the compound formed                   of caffic    acid and the me
tallic base         albumen, on the other hand, isolated from
                     ; that the
the acid body which favoured the solution in the liquid, is
deposited, and increases the volume of the precipitate; that
in order         to be convinced         of this fact, in one word, it is only
necessary            to boil a cafiate    of tin, lead, or alumine, in a co
loured vegetable decoction, in order to obtain the result now
mentioned.
   4. That the acid of coffee may be obtained very pure by
mixing watery decoctions of coffee or alcohol macerations
of     with muriate of tin or of lead, and afterwards decom
      it,

on decomposing the cafiate of lead by the sulphuric acid.

which       I   obtained     it,   and that   it   is   completely soluble in           al

     6. That      it   is    capable of decomposing                   the prussiate of
iron contained in the prussiate                  of potash      (a   common re-agent
in   the laboratories)         by

pound, which      precipitated and in this respect
                        is                   ;            may,                 it
perhaps, be of great use  to chemists, in order to obtain  very
pure, prussiate of potash, which hitherto could not be de
prived of some portions of iron which  obstinately retained.

     7.    That   the colour which            it      communicates to the solu
tion of oxygenated and green sulphate of iron, seems to be
completely new.
  8. That the attraction of the compounds which   forms                        it
with tin, lead, antimony, and alumine, and with the co
louring matter of infusions or vegetable decoctions, may
render    very useful in the art of dyeing.

as in the products of the distillation of this grain.

this acid with the gallic acid and the tanning principle, showed
no kind of identity of nature among these three very dif
ferent substances.
     11.   That the particular principle obtained                        by   Mr. Che
nevix   nothing else than the acid in question, but which
           is

enough examination.
     12.   That, having examined                 the  infusions and decoctions
of different kinds of               roasted      coffee, they gave me no evi
dence  of the existence of the tanning principle on mixing
them with gelatine, as asserted    Mr. Chenevix.   by

with various bases,       of forming particular salts, decomposable
in   the fire,  with more or    less facility ; and that its attractions,
in   one word,      seem to follow a law completely different from
that of most       of the  known acids, since its union with the
alkalis seems to be weaker.
     14.   That it is decomposed by warm sulphuric acid, by
the    nitric, muriatic, and oxymuriatic acids, and reduced by
the latter, as well as by the nitric, into malic acid.
     15. That it seems to me to be composed, according to
the products obtained by its analysis in the retort, of much
of carbon, and little hydrogen and oxygen.
     16. That 100 parts of watery extract of coffee, produced
from about 750 parts of coffee, yielded O'55 of cafHc acid,
0' 25 of extractive matter, 0' 05 of vegetable albumen, O'O9
of resinous matter, and 0'06 of loss.
     17- That in order to conform ourselves to the language
of modern chemistry, the acid of coffee ought to be called
eaffic acid, as the denomination which best suits it.
     1 8. That the charry and incinerated           residue of coffee   is
composed of muriate of potash, lime,              and a quantity  of iron
which       I was unable to appreciate.
     19.    Finally, that coffee, from all we have seen, is a sub
stance in which carbon is in a much greater proportion than
hydrogen, oxygen, or azote ; the existence of all these bo
 dies having been plainly demonstrated by the formation of
 oil, pyromucous acid, carbonic acid, and ammonia, formed
 in it by the distillation of this grain.

                     Physical Properties of Cinchona.
 AN commerce, many different                  species   of cinchona        are known j
 the principal and most frequently employed species, however,
 are the     following      :
     The first, antiently known by                the vague name          of Peruvian
 bark,     appears     to be that produced from the tree called by
 Linnaeus       cinchona       q/fichia/is.      This     species     has a grayish
 colour externally, and a pale                red internally       ; it  is very thin,
 rolled inwards on the side which adhered to the wood ; hav
 ing a glossy and as it were a resinous fracture, sometimes
 slightly fibrous ; an astringent and bitter taste.                         It yields  a
 fawn-coloured powder mixed with gray.
    • The effective pressure will always be as the height of the orifice H above
 that of the recurved tube y; and this pressure will continue uniform and pre
 cisely equal in both vessels, without regard to the quantity of water in A.

                          various Species          of Cinchona.                              37
     The   second      species,      called red cinchona, and erroneously
cinchona pitton, is         of   a deeper colour than the first, generally
very thick, not rolled or but litlle so, presenting a fibrous and
by no means a resinous fracture, Laving an astringent and
slightly bitter taste.
   Lastly, the third         more recently discovered, and
                                  species,
which ought not lo be confounded with the bark of the an-
gustura, as sometimes happens in laboratories, is designated
by the name    of yellow cinchona.
     Its colour  of a pale yellow; its taste is bitterer and less
                  is
astringent than that of the two former species; its fracture
is partly ligneous and partly resinous; it is a little more or
less rolled inwardly, according as it is more or less thick.
   Such are the three most commonly known species of cin
chona, and those most generally employed in medicine; but
there are many other species which are confounded with
them, the several varieties of which are perhaps regarded as
different species.   These varieties may be occasioned by the
age,  the  soil, the climate, or the parts of the tree from
which the bark has been taken*.
  Although the bark called angustura is not a true cincho
na; yet as it has some of the exterior characters of   and                             it,
as   may be easily confounded with
     it                                     right to make it,   it   is
known its distinguishing properties. This bark      yellow,                       is
extremely bitter,     no means astringent, and not at all
                             by
rolled up like the cinchonas.
                                        §         II.
Are       there any Characters               by   which to distinguish the good

  * M. Mutis
             distinguishes seven different species of cinchona lint the most  ;
of them are unknown in France. The only species known at Paris, besides
those mentioned above, are           thus denominated     :     qnintittina   rouge    ordinaire,
quinquina £'/i canfl'e, rjinttiiiti/ia gTis ;ilttt, quinquina Santa-F$ but we are by

no means certain that they belong to different species of trees.        We shall see,
a lit:le further on, that several of them resemble each other in almost every
point, and that otliers of them are not true cinihonas.

 38                          Experiments upon the
 as   well   as   for commercial      people who deal in the article by
 wholesale.
     If we had an accurate and simple method              of ascertaining
 the best species       of cinchona, or of distinguishing      them from
 the false, or from such as had been any way adulterated,                it
 would      be    wise in government, in my opinion, to institute
 a commission,         formed of physicians and apothecaries, in
 every sea      port town, in order to examine all the cinchonas
 which arrive       there,   and to prevent from being circulated in
 commerce such          as do not undergo the tests prescribed. But,
 unfortunately,       the   judgment hitherto formed upon the good
 or bad quality of this medicine has been made to depend
 upon some physical properties, often deceitful ; such as the
 colour,     smell,     taste,  fracture, compactness, &c.     ; qualities
 which      are too arbitrary,      because the senses and custom are
 the tests here employed.
    M.    Seguin      has lately endeavoured, by experiments, to
 throw   a   light upon this subject more certain than what we
 have hitherto had.           According to him, the aqueous infusion
of (he best sorts of cinchona possesses exclusively the pro
perty of precipitating           an   infusion  of  tan ; while, on    the
contrary,       the bad species precipitate a solution        of animal
gelatine:      thus he not only judges of the absolute qualities
of  these substances, but he can also give the measure             of the
respective qualities of the different species of cinchona, by the
greater or less abundance of the precipitates he obtains.
    If the observation of M. Seguin held true in all the good
cinchonas,        and  if  the phenomenon      which occasioned it was
owing      to the     principle, which in this substance is a febri
fuge, they         would    furnish a strong argument why govern
ment should adopt the measure above recommended.
    But I shall       have occasion,      hereafter, to make some re
marks upon the assertions of               M. Seguin, in showing that
there are several species        of true cinchona which      do not pre
cipitate a solution        of tan, but which, however,       are capable
of curing      fevers.
                                                                  §  III.

to which    joinedI              the examination              of   some     other vegetable
substanceswhich appeared to be analogous to cinchona, and
which have been also resorted to in the treatment of fevers.
 The infusions were prepared with the same quantities of
water, the same quantities of bark at an equal temperature
and during equal times  so that the differences we shall ob

because it retains some portions of the combination of this
principle with antimony.    This supposition, however, can
not be reconciled with the very abundant precipitation of
glue by certain cinchonas, which by no means precipitate
emetic.    It therefore follows, that the principle which
precipiiatcsglue maybe different from that which decomposes
emetic.
   Such are the phaenomena which the infusion of yellow
cinchona presented to me with the above re-agents.
   I was desirous of ascertaining if this same cinchona, al
ready exhausted           by cold water, would present, by             boiling    it,
any       differences    with   the same substances.            But   I    found an
almost perfect analogy in this respect; its decoction was
turbid upon cooling, and the precipitates which  furnished            it
with the re-agents were more abundant, and -were more
promptly separated from the liquor.
  I  shall add, that this decoction precipitates, like the in
fusion, the solution of sulphate of copper     reddish yellow,
                                                           in
and that of the acetate of lead           in
                                   yellowish white.
                Second Species. — Cinchona       of   Sunla-t'i.
     Thisspecies of cinchona, newly              introduced            into com,-
 rnurcc, has been tried, with respect            to its febrifuge            eflicts,
                                                                                  b/

                      various Species     of Cinchona.                     41
by several       excellent physicians,      who have obtained from it
 the happiest results.
     It is gray externally,     red  within, thick, little rolled,       hav
ing an astringent and slightly bitter taste.              Its infusion has
a much redder colour than that             of yellow cinchona.           Sub
jected to the same experiments with              the above     infusion,      it
 presented     the  following   effects :
     It precipitated the solution of glue in reddish flakes ; the
 infusion of yellow cinchona, in very abundant red ones :
 this last effect, which as far as I know has not been an
 nounced by any person, is worthy of remark.
     It produced no change in the emetic solution               :  this esta
 blishes    a difference between this and the yellow bark, which,
 as we have seen above, precipitates very abundantly this
metallic salt.
     It precipitates     the  solution    of sulphate of iron in        a fine
 deep green ;      sensibly reddens tincture       of turnsole; is preci
 pitated by oxalate of ammonia in oxalate of lime, but much
 less abundantly than the infusion of yellow cinchona.
     It precipitates acetate      of  lead and     sulphate   of copper iu
 reddish brown.
     On comparing the        phaenomena       produced by the cinchona
 of Santa Fe with        those of   the yellow     bark, we find among
 them some analogies and several differences. They both
 precipitate a solution of glue; but the infusion of the yellow
 cinchona precipitates emetic, and that of the cinchona of
 Santa-F6 does not precipitate it : from this it may be con
 cluded, that, both of them precipitating the other metallic so
 lutions, the principle which precipitates copper, iron, lead,
  &c.   is not the same      as that which       precipitates the emetic        ;
  and that, consequently, the yellow cinchona contains a sub
  stance which is not to be found in the Santa-Fe bark.
     It  is evident besides,     that,  if   these  infusions     were    per
 fectly similar, no turbidness would follow their reciprocal
  mixture : there are therefore in each of these infusions dif
  ferent substances,      which by combining become insoluble.
                   Decoction    of Santa-Fe Cinchona.
 ' This      decoction                                        with the
                           produced the same effects                        re
                                                                       agents

   4 .;                      Experiments upon the
  agents as its infusion ; but the latter differs from the decoc
  tion of yellow cinchona in not becoming turbid during cool
 ing: thus      the Santa-F6 bark not only docs not contain the
 matter which precipitates emetic, but is also deficient in the
 quantity of the principle which precipitates the other me
 tallic solutions     ;  for I am assured that the deposit formed in*
 the decoction of cinchona, upon cooling, is the substance
 which in this         species  precipitates iron green, lead yellow,
 copper brown, &c. ; and that it has no action upon emetic.
 Thence we may presume, at least, that it would be neces
 sary to employ in intermittent           fevers  a greater  quantity   of
 this than of the yellow bark.
  Third Species. — Gray Cinchona,            cabled Superior Cinchona.
      The infusion of this kind of bark is almost colourless;          its
 laste is bitter and astringent.
      It  precipitates very abundantly the solution of glue white;
 the    infusion   of tan -ed ; the solution of emetic white, and
very abundant ; sulphate of iron a very fine emerald green : it
produces no change in- the infusion            of yellow cinchona.
             Fourth Species. — Gray Cinnamon Cinchona.
     The infusion of this bark         has a deep red   colour, a  bitter
and astringent taste.
     In solution of glue it yields a fawn-coloured precipitate,
and communicates a green colour to solution of sulphate of
iron, but does not precipitate the emetic solution like the
gray and yellow           cinchona.    It occasions no change in the
infusion of superior gray         cinchona.
     This species differs, therefore, from the yellow and supe
rior gray cinchona, in so far as it does not seem to contain
that principle which precipitates the emetic ; and in this re
spect it resembles        that of Santa-Fe.
     The infusion of this bark yields          a very abundant    fawn-
coloured brown precipitate in an infusion of yellow cincho
na, and does not precipitate the infusion of tan.
     These vegetable infusion?, precipitated the one by the other
as    completely as it is possible, have no effect upon emetic;
whence it follows, that the principle which in the yel
                                                                     low

                      various Species        of Cinchona.                   43
low bark precipitates         the emetic, is combined with a certain
substance  found in the gray cinnamon cinchona and in tan :
but these infusions, thus mutually precipitated, still precipi
tate abundantly the solution of glue ; whence again it fol
lows, that the principle which in these two cinchonas preci
pitates glue is not the same as that which decomposes the
emetic     :   what confirms this opinion is, that the infusion of
the yellow cinchona, precipitated as completely as possible
by glue, and afterwards filtered, still precipitates the emetic,
— a little less abundantly, however.
  We cannot attribute the precipitation of the emetic to the
excess of glue, for this animal substance causes no change
whatever in emetic.
  The precipitate which is formed by the infusions of the
yellow and gray cinnamon cinchonas, mixed together, is
brown      ;   it dries easily, bubbles up by heat, exhales a smoke
which      has no pungency,       and which has some analogy with
that of'animal matters         :    it leaves   a   spongy and light char
coal.
                   Sixth Species. — Gray Cinchona*.
     It was in       slender and rolled barks, and must have
                   very
been      taken from the branches, or from very young trees.
Itwould seem to be of the species                    of the loxa cinchona,
which will be described in the course                of this memoir.
     The infusion of this
                        species had a red colour like Malaga
wine, and an astringent and bitter taste: it precipitated abun
dantly glue in white; infusion of tan in reddish yellow; in
fusion of yellow cinchona in gray ; emetic in flakes of yel
lowish white ; sulphate of iron in green ; and acetate of lead
in white.        It did not precipitate sulphate of copper nor              an
infusion        of Santa-Fi        cinchona.        This bark   possesses   the
febrifuge property in a very high degree.
               Seventh Species. — Flat Gray Cinchona             f.
     The infusion of this          species   of bark    has a red colour like
     * This
            species was transmitted to me by M. Bouillon-IiijTange.
 •)•   This seems to be the white cinchona of Santa-Fe, brought by    M. Hum-
boldt, which will be afterwards described.
                                                                      Malaga

44                        Experiments upon the
Malaga wine, a fetid taste, without astringency or bitter
ness.
   It precipitates abundantly the infusion of yellow cinchona
in brown flakes      ; it gives to the solution of red sulphate of
iron  a fine green colour, and produces therein, some mo
ments afterwards,        a precipitate of the same colour.
   Emetic, glue, cinnamon cinchona, experience no change
by the infusion of this bark.
   These phaenomena seem to announce that this bark is not
a true cinchona,        or,  if it does belong to this class of ve
getables, that it has none of their chemical properties : from
this we may presume that it does not possess ihe same me
dicinal virtues, because it has neither the bitterness nor the
astringency proper to all cinchonas in a greater or less de
gree : if we add to this, that it does not precipitate either
glue, emetic, or infusion of tan, properties which belong
to the best species of cinchona, we may be almost certain
that it is not a febrifuge.
  Eighth Species. — Yellow Cinchona.             (Cinchona pubescent
                                 of Walk*.)
    I00 grammes of this cinchona in fine powder, macerated
for 24 hours in distilled water, yielded a transparent liquor of
a golden-yellow       colour, very bitter, and becoming frothy on
agitation.     Tried by the re-agents, this liquor presented the
following    effects  :
   Gallated    alcohol      formed    an abundant precipitate, which
an excess    of this alcohol redissolved,      and which the addition
of water reproduced : this        proves that it is not a purely animal
matter which the tannin separates from it.
   It  precipitates the solutions of emetic and of nitrate of
mercury in yellowish-white, and causes a solution of sul
phate   of iron  to assume a very decided green colour, without
precipitating   any   thing from it.
   Solution     of size effects no change on it : it does not
redden turnsole tincture.            During the evaporation, this li-
   < The physical description of this cinchona has been made by Walh and
other medical botanists.
                                                                   quor

                     various Species   of Cinchona.                  45
quor deposited a red substance upon the sides of the pan                :
when reduced to the consistence of a syrup, it still depo
sited, upon cooling, a new quantity of matter of a chestnut-
brown colour.         The filtered liquor was still coloured, and
contained      the salt proper to cinchonas, which we shall pre
sently     describe.
    This brown substance, washed with a small quantity of
cold water, is completely soluble in warm water and in al
cohol; it is very little soluble in cold water; its taste is very
bitter.
    In the   aqueous    solution of this deposit, gall-nuts form an
abundant precipitate.         Emetic and nitrate of mercury pro
duced the same effects in it as in the infusion. The sulphate
of iron is turned        green by it.     The oxymuriatic acid loses
its smell, and soon forms a flaky precipitate with the solu
tion of this substance.
     Glue produces no more         effect   than in the infusion   : the
sulphuric and acetic acids cause no change in it. Diluted
with caustic potash, it does not exhale any ammoniacal
 smell.
     225 grammes      of this substance dry, submitted        to distil
 lation, yielded plenty of water, a sensible quantity of am
 monia, and a purple oil, which loses this colour on being
 dissolved in alcohol, but which resumes it in proportion as
 its solvent, when exposed to the air, is dissipated.
     It left in the retort 1 1 decigrammes of charcoal, which
 on combustion yielded a decigramme of ashes soluble with
 effervescence     in the muriatic acid, and the solution     of which
 furnished lime and iron.
     It  is evident,   from what has been        stated,  that it is this
 bitter coloured substance, which, in the maceration of the
  species of cinchona now under consideration, produces with
  the re-agents all the phenomena we have remarked above.
  This substance seems to hold the middle place, by its nature
  and properties, between vegetable and animal substances.
  It  is probably the substance which is the efficacious principle
  in the cure of intermittent         fevers.   The liquor    separated
  from this substance was treated         by alcohol,    which took up
  the colouring part, and it was nothing else than a portion of
                                                                      the

  46                     Experiments itpnn the
  the same matter retained by water. The portion not soluble
  in the alcohol was of the consistence of thick mucilage, and
  had   no longer any taste or colour ; it was abundantly dis
  solved in water, and its solution yielded, on spontaneous
 evaporation, lamellous crystals slightly coloured with a salt,
  which    we shall afterwards describe.
     The   seventh   maceration of the same quantity of cinchona
  still precipitating with gall-nuts, it was thought that cold
 water had not dissolved the whole of the principle which
 produced this effect : the refuse of this cinchona was there
 fore boiled, and we obtained a liquor which presented all
 the characters of the infusion, except that it did not precipi
 tate the emetic solution ; probably because          it was too much
 diluted with water.
     This   species  of cinchona,    therefore, is not the same as
 that which has been examined above under the same name.
                Ninth Species. — Cinchona qffioinalis.
     Eighty-four grammes of this bark,            treated  like the cin
 chona pubescens,      yielded a   liquor   less coloured     and more
 mucilaginous than the latter, although equally bitter.               This
infusion slightly     reddened  the   tincture  of  turnsole  ;   tried by
 the re-agents it presented phenomena similar to those of
 cinchona pubesceiis.
     All  the waters  of maceration, when       evaporated,     furnished
a deposit, the properties of which              were    so  confounded
with that obtained from the cinchona             pnbesccns that it was
thought       they might be mixed together; but the liquor
floating     above,  containing the essential salt of cinchonas,
was submitted separately to evaporation and to the spon
 taneous crystallization : after having separated from it the
colouring matter by means of alcohol, it furnished crystals
after a few days.       Here, therefore, are two species of cin
chona which do not precipitate glue, and which, conse
quently, are deprived of the principle to which this effect
is owing in other kinds; according to M. Seguin, they
would be ranked among the best kinds.
    After    several  washings   in cold water, the last washings
always precipitating by gall-nuts, the husks were treated by
                                                                     warm

 warm water, which acquired a deep enough colour; it was
 less bitter than the water of maceration, and it was still more
 mucilaginous      than the decoction of cinchona pubescent.
    It precipitated gall-nuts and nitrate of mercury, and greened
 the sulphate of iron; hut neither emetic nor glue produced
 any change upon it. This species, therefore, is not the same
 as that which has been above examined under the name of
 gray cinchona, called superior.
               Tenth Species. — Cinchona magnifolia.
     100 grammes       of this bark,   reduced    into  a fine powder,
  and     macerated    for  24 hours,    yielded a solution       which
 passed through the filter with difficulty ;    it  was  of a ruby red,
'little mucilaginous, of a slight bitterness, and       a very decided
 astrineency.
     The tincture     of turnsole   was not reddened      by this solu
 tion ; neither gall-nuts nor emetic formed any precipitate
  in it; the solution of glue precipitated it abundantly; the
  sulphate of iron made it assume the green colour of oxide
  of chrome, which the oxymuriatic acid turned into a dirty
  green.
     It also precipitated the maceration of cinchona pubescent
  and of cinchona officinalis.
      It is necessary to remark, that the second washing of this
  cinchona, made with cgld water, did not precipitate glue.
     The macerated aqueous extracts of this cinchona, evapo
  rated to the consistence of extract, while still hot were treated
  with alcohol, which acquired a very fine colour. This al
  coholic solution, diluted with water, and tried by the re
  agents which had been made use of for the first macerated
  extracts, presented the same results. Thus the matter which
  produced the effects above announced is soluble in alcohol.
      The part not soluble in alcohol was of an ochre red,
  which    was blackened by the air ; it was redissolved      in water    ;
  its solution would neither precipitate glue nor gall-nuts, but
  it precipitated emetic and nitrate of mercury, and turned
  sulphate    of iron green.
     Ten grammes of this substance, insoluble in alcohol, being
                                                               distilled,

 48                             Experiments upon the
 distilled, yielded ammonia, and                      a   charcoal weighing         41 cen
 tigrammes.
 Tenth Species. — Cinchona which was sold to me without any
                          Name *.
      100 grammes           of this bark,              for 24 hours, gave
                                                  macerated
a less deep colour                to water than the cinchona magnifolia;
but it was more bitter and less astringent. It reddened per
ceptibly the tincture of turnsole ; it neither precipitated the
emetic nor gall-nuts ; but it precipitated glue, and nitrate of
mercury,         and greened the sulphate                  of iron.
      In general, this        s_pecies    presented         all the characters        of the
cinchona magnifolia,                and    ought to be ranked in the same
class.
      The decoction of          the husks        of this cinchona              presented   no
difference on maceration, nor did it precipitate emetic.
              Eleventh Species. — True Pitton Cinchona.
      This   species      of bark, which         was given me by               M. Solome,
apothecary at Paris,              has a good deal             of resemblance, in co
lour and bitterness            of taste,      to the      cinchona of St. Domingo,
which M. Fourcroy analysed about fifteen years ago.
  100 grammes of this cinchona, treated like the other                                 spe
cies, connmmicatd              to water a blood red colour.                    Its taste was
more bitter and disagreeable than that of the others. Gallated
alcohol, emetic, nitrate of mercury, and sulphate of iron,
produced abundant precipitates with this solution ; glue pro
duced no change in it. The oxymuriatic acid precipitated
it, which no other acid effected.
   The infusion             evaporated         left   a   residue     which was partly
dissolved in alcohol,             and commumcated to                  it   a   fine red co
lour.  The portion insoluble in alcohol had   gray colour                  a
and an earthy appearance    that which was dissolved pre
                                          :
sented the same phenomena as the infusion from which                                       it
was produced.              This    substance          yielded ammonia upon                 di

                                 Bonpland.
Twelfth Species. — Cinchona of Loxa, coming from Branches
    of two Years of Age, and made use of in the Laboratory
    of the King of Spain.
    It  is gray externally,      yellowish within, very thin, rolled
 up, and has a bitter and astringent taste.
    Eight grammes of this bark, infused in 150 grammes of
water for 24 hours, at the temperature of 15° (60° Fahr.),
yielded a reddish yellow           slight-coloured liquid, having a
slight musty smell and            a bitter taste : it precipitated gall-
nuts, emetic, and acetate of lead, in yellowish- white ; iron
in blueish-green       ; oxalate   of ammonia, white; and glue in
large    glutinous     white flakes.      The precipitates formed by
glue and by emetic are         redissolved in an excess of warm in
fusion.
     According to these properties, this cinchona ought to be
accounted an excellent febrifuge.
       Thirteenth     Species. — White Cinchona       of Santa-Fi.
     This bark has a yellow colour, rusty externally,             deeper
 internally : it is flat and thick ; its fracture resembles       that  of
 beech bark     ; its taste is neither bitter nor astringent, like that
 of other cinchonas.
     Eight grammes, infused for 24 hours in 150 grammes of
 water, gave a deeper yellow colour than the cinchona of
 Loxa : this infusion does not precipitate gall-nuts, emetic,
 nor glue    : it turns solution      of iron green, and precipitates
 the acetate    of  lead  in brownish yellow.       According to these
 properties, this is not      a true  cinchona.
       Fourteenth Species. — Orange Cinchona           of Santa- Ft.
     This species, which was brought to Europe by Messrs.
 Humboldt and Bonpland, has a yellow colour like cinna
  mon : as this bark has no epidermis, it is thick, and its frac
  ture extremely fibrous; the thinnest pieces are rolled up
  within each other ; the thickest are flat, and it is by no
  means astringent; its infusion, made as above directed,
  is almost colourless ; its taste is decidedly bitter ; it gives in

it does not make the infusion of Loxa cinchona turbid. This
differs from the Loxa cinchona, and, it would seem, docs not
possess the properties                  of   a febrifuge      in any remarkable de
gree.
              Fifteenth Species. — Common                Cinchona        of Pera."
     This      species is gray externally,             of an ochre red internally,
and its surface is wrinkled ; it is rolled, and                  of various thick
ness   its taste is bitter and astringent.
          ;
  Eight grammes, infused for 24 hours in 150 grammes of
water, communicated a slight yellow colour to     and                             it,          a
bitter and astringent taste. This infusion precipitates emetic,
glue, and tannin, in yellowish-white, and sulphate of iron
in green.      reddens turnsole paper.
                     It
     This      species    of cinchona            seems to be the same as the gray
cinchona called superior. According to the properties                                   it   pre
sented to me,    ought to be excellent for fevers.
                         it
              Sixteenth Species. — Red Cinchona                    nf   Santa-Fe.
     It
     did not seem to differ perceptibly from that which we
described above               by
                   the name of Santa-Fe cinchona.
     Eight grammes of this cinchona,                         infused like the pre
ceding, gave to the water                    a   red colour like Malaga wine, and
a   taste not very bitter, but astringent.           glue in
                                                           It      precipitates
brown,         but neither emetic nor tanningreens the sul    ;    it
phate of iron, and reddens slightly turnsole paper.   These
chemical properties agree with those of the Santa-Fe cin
chona above described.
Seventeenth Species. — Yellow Cinchona ofCuenfa; Branches

                          of          Age*.              of
     This cinchona             is   gray externally,       covered        with     a    white
moss, yellowish-brown internally, having    fibrous fracture        a
and hardly any taste its maceration ;    neither bitter nor   is
astringent  precipitates neither emetic, glue, nor tannin
                 ;                                                                             ;
it merely greens sulphate of iron, and precipitates acetate of
lead. This cinchona does not seem to have any febrifuge
virtue.

                                                          oured.
    In order     to acquire some          more light upon the nature of
the principles        of   the cinchonas,        I examined comparatively
several      other vegetable substances which seemed to have
analogies with them, and the composition of which is a
little less known ; such as' gall-nuts, oak bark, the angus-
tura, and some others.
    Gail-Nuts. —The infusion of this substance gave in a so
lution of glue an abundant white precipitate; with iron, a
blue; with emetic, a yellowish-white precipitate; with in
fusion of yellow cinchona, dirty white flakes ; with copper,
yellowish-brown; and with                lead, a yellowish-white           precipi
tate.
    It did not precipitate the infusion of Santa-F6 cinchona,
nor the infusion of tan.
    The infusion of gall-nuts, therefore, comprehends, like
                                        D2                                        the

-V*            On the various Species         of Cinchona.
the yellow cinchona, the principle which precipitates glue
along with that which precipitates emetic ; and in this re
spect   these  two substances         resemble    each other    :   but they
differ in respect of the bodies which            act upon tan and upon
iron, since this metal is precipitated          green by cinchona, and
blue by gall-nuts; they also differ in another respect,                    as
they mutually precipitate each other.
    Tan Bark. —The infusion of this substance, made                  as care
fully  and with the same quantity          of water   as  cinchona, gives
in the solution of nine a yellow precipitate; with iron, a
blue ; with copper, a brown precipitate : but it did not cause
any change in the solution of Santa-Fe cinchona, nor in the
emetic solution      :  it reddens   the   tincture  of turnsole,      and is
precipitated by the oxalatc of ammonia.
    We see by this that oak bark does not contain,                like gall-
nuts, yellow      cinchona,      and   some others,        that   substance
which precipitates emetic         ; and that, although both         of them
precipitate glue, yet they differ in this respect.
    Bark of tlie Cherry Tree. — This bark, which has been
sometimes fraudulently substituted for cinchona, has no
thing in common with the latter, except the property of
giving a green precipitate with a solution of sulphate of iron.
It produces no change upon glue, emetic, nor decoction of
tan.    It is therefore very doubtful if the cherry tree bark
possesses any febrifuge property.
    Centaurium and (Jliumcedrys. —These two plants furnished
the same results as the cherry tree bark, and it is equally
doubtful if they can cure fevers.
    Bark of   the    White Willow.      —This     bark, to which febri
fuge   virtues   were      formerly   attributed,    certainly possesses
some of the chemical properties of some species of cin
chonas   ; it precipitates glue, sulphate of iron green, and the
acetate of copper brown.           Thus, as it unites bitterness and
astringency,     it may be a febrifuge.
    Angustura. — The infusion of this bark             does not precipi
tate glue;   but  it   precipitates abundantly     the   infusion of gall-
nuts and infusion of yellow cinchona, but not at all that
of Santa-Fe cinchona; it only produces              a  slight turbidness
in it.
                                                                            It

    It  precipitates iron, emetic, copper, lead, and infusion of
tan, all in yellow.
    This bark differs, as we see, from several cinchonas and
other     substances    examined by comparison, in so far as it
does not precipitate animal gelatine : it has no astringent
taste, and yet it has an extremely bitter one. There is reason
to believe      that the principle which in this substance preci
pitates the metallic solutions is not entirely similar to that
of the cinchonas, at least the colour of the precipitates
which it furnishes is very different. Nevertheless, according
to these properties, the bark of the angustura may be a very
 good febrifuge.

 I   BEG leave to send you an account of an experiment on
 the comparative culture of turnips; and have the honour

            To   Dr. C. Taylor,
  Secretary    to the Society of Arts, &c.
     Being desirous of ascertaining, by experiment, the best
 mode of cultivating turnips, I prepared, in 1805, 2O statute
 acres of land well calculated for such trial.                The whole spot
  was level, and the soil similar in every part.                 By manuring
  it equally with     ten cart loads per acre         of rotten farm-yard
 dung, after it       had   been    properly summer tilled, it was fit,
 by the 24th      of June, for    the reception      of the   seed.     In order

 to make the experiment perfectly accurate, I divided the
 field, which is square, into ten equal parts and sowed the
 whole of them alternately by drill and broad-cast at the same
 time.     The drills were 12 inches asunder. The seed was of
 the  white-loaf stock, and I had the satisfaction           to find that
 no   part failed.      The divisions were all of them       hoed at the
 same time     ; and care was taken to set the plants, as well the
 broad-cast    as the   drilled,   12  inches apart. The expense for
 the whole was 7s. per acre; but from the drilled plants re
 quiring an extra man and horse per acre beyond the broad
 cast,  1  estimate    the relative   expense as eight to seven.       Sixr
 teen perches     of  each were set out and weighed by three re
 spectable    farmers and graziers who reside in the parish of
 Reedham, where the experiment was made, and who have
 set their names to the certificate sent herewith.

 with much             greater ease be drawn up for a second person to

a patent)  which perhaps was partly the reason why he did

     P. S. Mr. James Decker, No. 321, Strand,             an ingenious
mechanic, who some years ago ascended with an air-balloon
of his own construction, now undertakes           to make these fire-
escapes,    also the  hoop-topped      fire-sacks above mentioned,
when ordered     ; and  I hope   and believe he may be trusted for
executing them with great security.          The price will     vary ac
cording to the length     of  the rope required.     The separate ar
ticles of that of which I send you the figure amounted to
 } I. 8s. fid.; more than half of which            cost was the rope
 (26 yards). What a tradesman         may think a reasonable       profit
I   am not able to say.
   Description and Method        of using     the Machine      called a
                       SLING FIRE-ESCAPE.
     The principal parts of this machine are the following:
     1. The suspension iron A (Plate II.), which              is formed
like    a ramhead commonly used for slinging goods from
warehouses, with       this difference,      the  bottom     hooks    are
 turned up close to the upright part, to form two close
rings or eyes : the length of this iron is about four inches
 and    a half, thickness of the iron out        of which it is     ham
 mered is about    half an inch.
     2.  The rope B. This is       made    of flax,   and   platted  in a
 peculiar manner, for which there was a patent taken out.
 It is sold by Armstrong, St. John's-square, Clerkenwell,
 and measures      about three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
 The rope must be in length somewhat more than twice the
 height of the window from the ground.
     3. The regulator C.       This is an oblong piece of beach
 wood, six inches and        a  half in length, three inches and a
 quarter broad, and     about seven-eighths of an inch thick : in
 this there are four holes pierced for the rope to pass through ;
 one of these is open at the side : there is also a notch at the
 top of tliis piece of wood, and an oblong hole about seven-
 eighths of an inch from the bottom.
     4. The upper belt D is a stout leathern strap, about four
  feet three inches long and one and a half brpad, with a
  buckle to it.
      5. The lower belt    E   is a strap   of the   same    sort as the
                                                                   other ;

                     invented        by       Daniel Maseres, Esq.                                  5J
other; but the end, after being put through the buckle, is
sewed down : this is for the purpose of security, in else the
tongue of the buckle should by accident break.
    6.           strap F, so called from its connecting the re
         The union
gulator to the other  parts of the machine.    This is leathern,
and is about a foot and a half long and an inch and a quarter
broad     :    it has, like the others,               a   buckle to it.             It   is stained
black, which distinguishes it from the other leathern straps.
   The method of putting together all these parts of the ma
chine         is,
          first to pass one end of the rope through the holes
in the regulator, then through the two lower rings of the
suspension iron           :    the upper belt             then to be passed through
                                                          is
a  doubling of the union strap                    ;   after which the rope     to be         is
tied to that belt, and the knot secured    string from slip              by
                                                                          a
ping (which string   to pass through two small holes in the
                                is
leather)  and at
               ; about   foot below the rope
                                          a     to be tied to                  is
the lower belt in like manner.                             Next,         the union strap           is   to
be put through the oblong hole in the regulator, and buckled;
 bywhich the upper belt and the regulator will be connected.
The other           end   of    the rope may be kept wound on
                                                     wooden                              a
roller, to prevent  from getting entangled.

   Persons who purchase these machines should have      very                                   a
strong iron hook, with    spring-catch, fixed to some secure

part of the window-frame, or elsewhere      on this hook the              ;

                           is                         by
                                   the upper ring, when any
one wishes to descend                     from the window.                    The next         opera
tion     is    to step intolower belt with both feet, and draw
                                    the
    up sufficiently high, so as to form    kind of swing to sit
in it
                                                                     a
    : the part of the strap which     through the buckle  is to                                    is
be laid hold         of with        the left hand         ;    and the buckle,            with the
 right hand,     to be slipt to its proper place, according to
                     is
 the size of the person the tongue   :  then to be put into oneis
 of the holes, as in buckling common straps. After this                                                 is
 done, the upper belt    to be somewhat loosely buckled round
                                    is
 the chest, and then the rope which                                 is   on the roller       is    to be
 thrown out of window on the ground.
   Now all being ready for descending, the person  to get                                 is
 out of the window, grasping tight, with one or with both
                                                                                               hands,

  hands, 'the rope at some convenient part, taking especial
  care n'ot to meddle with the suspension iron until quite out
  of window; after which the rope below the regulator is to
  be laid hold of with the right hand, and to be let to run
 through the holes as fast as there may be occasion ; for
 which purpose, if necessary, it may be easily slipped out of
 the open hole; it will then have the check of only three
 holes  : if the  motion is wanted to be retarded, the rope is to
 be put into the notch at the upper part of the regulator.
    When one person has descended, and there is a neces
 sity for a second immediately to follow, the union strap is
 to be unbuckled ; when the regulator will be separated from
 the upper belt : the belts may then be very easily drawn up,
 having the friction of the suspension iron only, and the
 person above is to put on the belts as the other did, and is
 to be let down gradually, partly by the one below, and partly
 by managing     the rope as the first did : in this case great care
 must be taken,     as the check occasioned by the regulator is
 gone.
                     Observations and Cautions.
    It is not easy to lay down exact rules for what number of
holes the rope must pass through, as this must vary accord
ing to the weight of the person, and other circumstances. It
would be well, before the person gets out of window, to exa
mine, first, (absolutely necessary), whether the suspension
iron is on the hook ; then, that the three buckles are fast,
the two knots tied, and that the rope is in the hole of
the regulator which has the opening.           Great care must be
taken that there is not any impediment to the free running
of the rope; for which the wall of the house must be exa
mined, and any nails or hooks which may chance to be there
removed ; also iron scrapers, and every thing wherein the
rope may be likely to hitch.

VIII.    On preserving Turnips as Food              for  Cattle in Winter,
              By    Mr. JAMES DEAN, of Exeter*.
\\r      SIR)
 W HEN surveying         an estate    in the South-Hams of Devon,
in February last, my attention was attracted by the singular
appearance of a crop of turnips in an orchard ; so thick as
to touch each other, and closely surround the stems of the
apple trees.     I inquired of the farmer the reason of so un
usual a crop, and I received from him some curious inform
ation.    It was the constant practice, he said, in his neigh
bourhood, for farmers, after they had broken up ley ground,
first to take  a  crop of turnips ; and in the autumn, or rather
winter, to sow wheat in the same ground.                       Should winter
fodder be scarce, they then preserved the turnip crop for
stock,   and consequently could            not put in wheat before Ja
nuary   ; and even then       with no probability of having more
than two-thirds      of an  usual crop, because          of the   late sowing.
This   was an evil    of great magnitude,           and led   him,    he added,
to make trial    of a mode peculiarly successful, enabling him
to sow his seed in the proper season, and to save the most
valuable of his turnip crop during the winter.
    He got, he said, his turnip seed into the ground early in
June ; and in October, by which time the turnips would
have grown to a large size, he had the largest of them drawn
without injuring the leaves, and then placed close to eacn
other on the grass in the orchard, in the same position in
which    they grew.       Their    leaves      preserved     them from ex
ternal injury   ; and    their tap roots put out, in a short time,
other fibrous      roots into the grass, which, in orchards, is
generally long in the autumn ; and thus the turnips were
preserved good for use.
    I inquired whether the turnips acquired any additional size
after their removal into the orchard, and whether, from the
warmth      occasioned by the turnips to the ground, any ad
vantageous effect was apparent in the apple trees.                     On these
questions he was not able to speak                    positively,    though h$

thought the turnips had increased in size ; and he thought,
likewise, that the crops of apples appeared larger, and the
annual bearings more certain in the orchard I was observing,
than in those where no turnips were put ; though, till the
time I spoke, he had not even guessed at the cause.

  IX.    Some Account       of Poly autography ; a Discovery lately
                  made     of Printing from Stone *.
 JL HIS very ingenious art was first discovered in Germany by
Aloys Senefelder, and was introduced into this country in
1801, when it obtained a patent.
    The following is the process : —A drawing is made with
a pen and a prepared         liquid upon a level stone with a smooth
surface, in the manner and with the same facility as a pen
and    ink drawing     :   the stone is then, by a very simple pro
cess,   rendered capable of repelling the printing ink, except
in those parts which have been drawn upon by the before-
mentioned liquid, to which it adheres : it is then dabbed over
with the balls as in printing, and the impression is taken by
a cylinder being passed over         it ;  and by this means you have
an exact reversed fac-simile         of   the original   sketch.   There
is also a prepared pastil of the consistence of Italian chalk,
and with which you can also draw on the stone, which, when
printed,    cannot be distinguished from a chalk drawing.
    The stone is of a yellowish gray, of a very compact tex
ture, smooth grained and brittle.
    This invention, from the extreme facility with which a
person totally ignorant of any method of engraving may, in
a few hours,       multiply     as  many originals     as he pleases at a
very trifling expense        and trouble,    is certainly   deserving  of
             *  Communicated by H. B. Ker, Esq. Sloan-strtet.
                                                                      the

the serious attention           of      the artists and amateurs            in general
of this country.
  One of its great            advantages        is,   that instead     of   a   copy, as
in the case of an engraving or etching,                      you produce         a    per
fect fee simile of the original design.                        And
                                                                 I     here take an
opportunity of correcting an error, in short and inaccurate
                                                         a
account given    Mr. Nicholson in his Journal, which states
                       by
that the liquid with which the drawing     made required twois
or three days to dry before   can be printed. The fact
                                         it               the                       is,
impressions may be taken the minute the drawing   made,                      is
as the liquid dries almost immediately.  Any  number of
impressions may be taken from the drawing                        :    between        4000
and 5000 impressions have already been taken from                               a   draw
ing, without      the least alteration.
  This art       is     applicable to the printing of the finest
                      also
writing   ;    and music also has been printed from  with great        it
success.

     This gentleman writes ostensibly to correct my                       " erro

no adequate representation of the science of trigonometry as
it   now exists.       I    did not turn aside to speak of   Mr. Keith's
book,      when  I     was reviewing         Mr. Bonnycastle's  but this
                                                                      ;
gentleman now compels me to say, that, although his work
may exhibit traces of his industry, displays little else.
                                                   it                         I
must likewise remark, that the assertion with which he
quarrels    is   perfectly correct;       for, although Mr. Bonnycastle
may have selected many of                his examples from other authors
(and he would know little of the value                  of time   if   he endea
voured to frame    complete set of new ones himself), he
                         a
has, especially in the spherical trigonometry, modified all
their solutions according to the ten commodious and judi
cious rules he has given at pages 8O, 102, and 121, which
comprehend the whole doctrine of that branch of the science.
     The   charges       which Mr. Keith          against Mr.
                                                   has adduced
Bonnycastle       not
                  it    my
                       is   immediate  business  to refute.                   I
may remark, however, that Mr. Keith's principal celebrity
arises from his prevailing habit of advancing insinuations of
plagiarism, or incapacity, against every author whose cha
racter he feels inclined to attack   from those of Horsley,
                                               ;
Maskelyne, and Vince, down to the lowest scribbler who
falls in his way. As to his accusations against Mr. Bonny
castle, on page 330 of your last number,       will assert most
                                                         I
positively in general terms that they are not correct.  No two
performances on the same subject can be less alike than the
two now spoken of.     Mr. Bonnycastlc may probably have
taken some practical examples from Mr. Keith's book but                   ;
not two,   Imay safely affirm, which contain any essentially
new principle  and;    great proportion of what he may have
                             a
                                                      taken

                  On Bonny castle's Trigonometry.                   63
taken are,    I doubt not, such as       Mr. Keith had previously
borrowed     from other authors       ; for Mr. Keith has himself
borrowed practical examples from at least ten authors on si
milar topics whose treatises I have read, and to which I am
at any time prepared to refer him, if such a reference were
necessary.      Indeed, all authors follow the practice of se
lecting examples from preceding writers on similar subjects;
and   Mr. Keith has, in conformity with this practice, copied
into   some of his former works matter from other perform
 ances of the very person against whom he is now preferring
 complaints.      But there is this difference, it seems, between
 the habits    of Mr. Bonnycastle and Mr. Keith : when the
former   collects   from different works, he is accused of copy
ing ; when the latter copies from one work, as from the
Nautical Almanac,         he calls  it collecting ; and then, when
 another adopts the same tables from the same place, he is
 accused of copying from Mr. Keith !
    Mr. Keith, when particularizing            the   plagiarisms with
 which he accuses Mr. Bonnycastle,           refers to two diagrams,
 which   he says are the same size         " as  if pricked from his
 plates by schoolboys."        Now, sir, this I will without hesi
 tation assert, from a careful examination          of the matter, is
far from    true.     There are lines in   Mr. Bonnycastle's figures
 not  to be found      in Mr. Keith's : and further, those figures
 are not the same size as Mr. Keith's ; neither are the re
 spective points of intersection at the same relative distance.
 So that what Mr. Keith asserts positively, in a case where
 detection is easy, is directly impossible ; and the public will
 therefore be able to give a due degree of credit to all his
 sweeping charges.
    Since there is in general hut one method of constructing
 these figures, a great similarity must necessarily prevail, as is
 really the case amongst all the works in which this part of
 the subject is introduced ; so that the cry of plagiarism on
 such an occasion is perfectly ridiculous, as I have no doubt
 Mr. Keith      very well knows.        How far Mr. Bonnycastle
 may judge     it right  to enter  into  any altercations with Mr.
  Keith, in consequence of the liberties he has taken with his
  character, is not for me to decide.        I  have  only to add, that
                                                                  what

64            Experiments        on a Substance,        which possesses
what      I   have stated       in this letterwill probably be just as
"    erroneous
                     " in Mr.     Keith's views, that               is,

XI. A third            Experiments on an artificial Substance,
                     Series     of
     which possesses the principal characteristic Properties
     of Tannin; with some Remarks on Coal. By Charles
     Hatchett,        Esq. F. R.       S*   ,
                                          §1-
LNT my former papers upon this subject, some account has
been given of the effects produced                     by
                                     sulphuric acid upon
turpentine, resin, and camphor; and       shall now state the
                                                        I
results of other experiments made with the same acid upon
a great number of the resins, balsams, gum resins, and gums,
the greater part of which afforded that modification of the
artificial tanning substance, which, for the sake of distinc
tion,  I  have in the preceding papers denominated the third
variety.
  The         process was simpledigestion              in
                                            sulphuric acid, after
which,         the residuum was well edulcorated, and was then
digested       in   alcohol.      This    distillation, the
                                         was separated         by
dry substance which remained was infused in cold distilled
water, and the portion dissolved was examined       solution                 by
of isinglass, muriate of tin,                acetite    of lead,          and     sulphate
of iron.
    Much sulphureous                 acid, carbonic         acid,    several       of the
vegetable                                   benzoic
                                     acid, (when the bal
                   acids, particularly
sams were employed,) and apparently water, were produced
during the operation but in this paper
                                ;         shall only notice I
two of the products, namely, the tanning substance and
the coal.
               *   From the Transactions nfthe Royal Sodtlyfor            1806.
                                                                                     The

              the characteristic Properties        of Tannin.            C3
    The sulphuric acid almost immediately dissolved             the resins,
 and   formed    transparent      brown     solutions,    which   progres
 sively became black.
    The   same   effect   was produced on most         of  the other sub
 stances, but the solutions of         the balsams and       of guaiacum
were at first   of a  deep crimson,       slightly  inclining to brown.
    Caoutchouc      and elastic    bitumen     were not dissolved, but,
after having been digested for more than two months,                  were
only superficially carbonized.
    The gums      and the saccharine substances required             many
evaporations and filiations before the whole                 of their car
bonaceous residua could he obtained.
    These were     the principal      effects observed     during the ex
periments,     and   I  have    stated   them in this       manner, that
tedious and useless repetitions may be avoided.
                                    § II.
    Turpentine, common           resin, elemi, tacamahac, mastich,
copaiba, copal, camphor, benzoin, balsam of Tolu, balsam
of Peru, asa foetida, and amber, yielded an abundance of
the tanning substance.
    Oil of turpentine      also   afforded much       of it  ; asphaltum
yielded a small portion ; some slight traces of it were even
obtained from gum arabic and tragacanth ; but none was
produced by guaiacum, dragon's blood, myrrh, gum ammo
niac,    olibantim,     gamboge,       caoutchouc,      elastic bitumen,
liquorice, and manna.          I am persuaded,      however, that many
of these would have afforded the tanning substance had not
the digestion been of too long a duration.
    Olive oil   was    partly converted into the above-mentioned
substance, and       also  linseed oil, wax, and animal fat , but
the three last appear to merit some attention.
                               Linseed Oil.
   This oil with sulphuric acid very soon formed a thick
blackish-brown liquid, which, after being long digested in a
sand-bath, was still partly soluble in cold water, and passed
the filter. This solution precipitated gelatine ; the residuum
was a tough black substance, which became hard on expo
sure to air. A great part was soluble in alcohol, and formed
  /Vol. 27. No. i05. Peb.         1807.       E                   a brown

 66        Experiments on a Substance        which possesses
a brown liquid, which became turbid by the addition of
 water.     When this was evaporated, a brown substance re
 mained,     which was partially dissolved by cold water, and
 the solution thus formed was rendered           turbid by gelatine.
    The undissolved portion left by the alcohol              was   of  a.
blackish -brown ; it was soft and tenacious, and           appeared   to
 retain many of       the properties  of an inspissated fat oil.
                             Bleached ff'ax.
   That which was employed in this experiment was the
white wax of the shops, which is sold in the form of small
ron ail cakes.       It formed with sulphuric acid a thick black
magma, and was not acted upon by cold distilled water
when washed with it upon a filter.             Upon being digested
with alcohol in a sand-bath, a brownish solution was form
ed, which upon cooling became very turbid, and appeared
as if filled with a white flocculent substance.              The same
operation was repeated with different portions of alcohol
until this ceased to act. The whole of the solutions in al
cohol were then mixed,          a large  quantity   of distilled water
was added, and the alcohol was separated by distillation.
    On the surface of the remaining liquor, when cold,                 a
white crust was formed, which being separated was found
to possess      the properties of spermaceti, and weighed 18
grains.     The    filtrated liquor was then evaporated to a small
quantity, became of a pale brown colour,            and was rendered
turbid by solution of isinglass.
                               Animal Fat.
   This experiment was          made upon the kidney fat of veal,
but   I cannot take upon me to assert that the results would
have    been the same with every kind of tat.            IOO grains of
it with one ounce of concentrated sulphuric acid, alter some
time,    formed    a blackish soft mass; a second ounce of sul
phuric    acid  was     then added, and the whole was digested
and occasionally heated during nearly three months.                 Six
ounces    of  distilled   water were   poured upon    the black   pulpy
mass, and formed a thick uniform liquid, which, after di
gestion for six or seven days, was when cold filtrated.            The
liquor   which    passed    was of a  brown   colour,  and  upon   eva
                                                               poration

             tlie characteristic Properties  of Tannin.             07
poration became black, leaving a considerable portion of a
blackish substance upon the filter, which was added to that
which    had been collected by the first filtration.      The whole
was washed       with   cold   water,  which    passed    colourless.
Boiling    water was then      poured upon    the filter, by   which
a considerable portion was rapidly dissolved, and a brown
ish-black solution was formed, which copiously precipitated
gelatine.
    The residuum on the filter was then dried, and being col
lected was digested in alcohol, which dissolved the greater
part.
    The solution in alcohol was filtrated, but (apparently by
the effect of air) a considerable deposit was formed on the
filter, which was again dissolved by alcohol.            Water ren
dered the solution turbid, and a black light flaky substance,
which weighed 41 grains, remained upon the filter. The
filtrated liquor was then evaporated, and left a grayish-black
substance, which weighed 30 grains.             This last substance
was highly inflammable, and when burned emitted a very
peculiar odour, resembling partly that of fat and partly that
of asphaltum.       It easily melted, and also immediately dis
solved in cold alcohol, from which, like the resinous sub
stances, it was precipitated by water.
    The black light flaky residuum, which weighed 4 1 grains,
was found to consist partly of the substance above men
tioned and partly of coal, but the proportion of this last was
 not ascertained.
    Coagulated albumen and prepared muscular fibre were also
separately exposed to the action of sulphuric acid in the
manner above described, but did not afford any substance
by which gelatine could be precipitated, coal being the only
 product which remained.
     Almost every one of the bodies which have been em ployed
 in  these experiments,     seem to be in some    measure    different
 in  respect to the progressive effects produced upon them by
 sulphuric acid   ; and  all other circumstances      being similar,
 there appears to be a certain period     of the process    when the
 production of the tanning substance has arrived at its maxi
 mum, after which, a gradual diminution of it takes place,
                                  K  2                             and

68          Experiments on a Substance             which possesses
and at length total destruction.                These effects are produced
at different periods, according to the substance which may
be the subject of the experiment, and therefore it is impos
sible at present to state the utmost quantity of the tanning
substance which, under equal circumstances, may be ob
tained from each         of the resins, balsams, &c.
    The tanning substance           appears       to be always the same,
whether obtained from turpentine, or common resin, or
from the balsams, or from asa fcetida, or camphor, or indeed
from any of the bodies which have been enumerated ; its
effects on the different reagents are similar; by the addition
of a small portion of mtric acid, and subsequent evaporation*
it  is converted into that which         I    have called the first variety ;
or    if digested with      sulphuric acid, it is speedily destroyed,
and becomes mere coal.              In the latter case, therefore, the
same agent        which   at first produced it becomes         at length the
cause     of  its destruction ; and thus we find that although a
tanning      substance    may be obtained from resinous and other
bodies by means of sulphuric and by nitric acid, yet in the
former      case    the product is variable, and is formed at or
about the mean period of the operation, whilst the latter is
an ultimate and invariable effect, beyond which no appa
rent change can be produced by any continuation                       of  the
process*.
                                    § III.
     I  have    already  stated, that caoutchouc,          and elastic bitu
men, were only superficially acted upon when digested for a
very long time in sulphuric acid ; and it is remarkable, that
these substances, which in their external characters so much
resemble each other,          should be similar in their habits when
exposed      to the effects or this aci$l      ; for, unlike the resins and
most      of the other      bodies which were         subjected to the pre
ceding experiments,           and which were almost immediately
dissolved when the acid           was poured upon them, these on
the contrary        remained undissolved, and only became par
tially carbonized on their surfaces.                Even   nitric acid doet
   • In the former
                      papers upon this subject I have observed, that the tan
ning lubttance produced by sulphuric acid is very inferior in energy to that
which is formed by nitric acid.            .,
                                                                         not

does when applied to the other bituminous substances.
     1.   100 grains   ofsoft elastic bitumen were digested
                            pure
during three weeks in one ounce of nitric acid, diluted with
an equal quantity of water; a tough and slightly elastic
orange-coloured mass then remained. Another ounce of
the acid, not diluted, was poured upon this mass, and the
digestion was continued until the whole was evaporated.
The residuum was tenacious, and of                           the colour above men
tioned.  Water partially dissolved                           it,   and   formed   a    deep
yellow     liquid, which copiously precipitated gelatine, and
possessed the other properties of the tanning substance which
is   produced from the resins,              8cc.        by   nitric acid.
     An orange-coloured              mass       still    remained,            which        was
speedily dissolved       by
                       alcohol,                 and      was precipitated from              it
by   large
     a     addition of water.
   This substance in many of its properties resembled the
resins, but in others, seemed to approach those which cha
racterize the vegetable extractive matter.      appeared to              It
be similar to that which has been cursorily mentioned in my
first paper, and which was obtained from many of the pit-
coals and bitumens when treated with nitric acid.   have                          I
since paid more attention to this substance during the fol
lowing experiments          :
   Kilkenny coal was digested with nitric acid, and pro
gressively, although with difficulty, was converted into that
variety of the tanning substance which has so often been
mentioned.    Similar experiments were made on the same
sort of coal        from Wales, which                   was        given to me      myby
friend     Mr. Tennant,         as   well    as    upon        a    coal sent to me         by
Professor     Woodhouse, which                  was from Pennsylvania,                     and
is   there called   Leigh high coal.               All of          these were convert
ed into the tanning   substance, but they did not yield any
product similar to that obtained from the elastic bitumen.
  The contrary, however, happened when the common pit-
coal, or Canncl coal, or asphaltum, were employed.    For
when these were treated in the way which has been describ

then  I   obtained from 100 grains of each of the above sub--
                                      E     3                                     stances

70       Experiments on a Substance             which possesses
stances   (after the separation of the tanning             matter)     a resi
duum    as  follows :
    From 100 grains of the common Newcastle coal 9 grains.
    From 100 grains of Canncl coal                 -       -      36irrains.
    From 100 grains of pure asphaltum              -       -      37 grains.
    The substances thus obtained were very similar in their
external characters, being of a pale brown, approaching to
Spanish snuff colour] their internal fracture was dark brown,
with a considerable degree of resinous lustre. When exposed
to heat     they did not easily melt, but as soon as inflamed
they emitted a resinous odour mixed with that of fat oil,
and produced a very light coal, much exceeding the bulk of
the original    substance.
    Alcohol completely dissolved them,             and  if water in    a  large
proportion      was    added to a saturated       solution,    a  precipitate
\vas obtained     ;  but after each precipitation a portion always
remained dissolved by the water, which acted upon the dif
ferent reagents in a manner similar to the solutions of
vegetable    extractive matter.         The flavour   was alo bitter, and
in   some degree aromatic,          so that   the residua, whether          ob
tained from pit-coal, from Cannel coal, or from asphaltum,
seemed to possess properties intermediate between those of
resin and those       of the    vegetable extractive substance.           They
appeared, however, to be removed only by a very few degrees
from the tanning substance ; for if digested in a small quan
 tity of nitric acid, and subsequently evaporated, they were
immediately converted into            it; or if digested     with sulphuric
 acid, they speedily became reduced to coal.
                                     § IV.
    In  the   5th    section   of  my second paper, some remarks
 were made on the decoctions obtained from vegetable sub
 stances   which      had   been previously roasted        ;  and   although
 (excepting one instance) these decoctions did not afford any
 permanent precipitate with gelatine, yet I have there stated,
 that I did not think it right to conclude, that similar de
 coctions made under certain circumstances,                  might not oc
 casionally possess       those    properties which      characterize the
 tanning substances.         Moreover      I also observed      in the same
 paper,   that all   of  those    decoctions,    upon the addition          of a
                    2                                                    small

smalf portion of nitric acid and subsequent evaporation, be
came converted into that variety of tanning matter which is
produced by the action of nitric acid upon carbonaceous
substances. I have since extended trxese experiments, and
shall here give some account of them.
   1. 200 grains of the fresh peels of horse chestnuts were
digested for about 12 hours        in three ounces of distilled water.
The      liquor was of     a   pale brown, and formed a slight
pale brown      precipitate when solution          of isinglass was   added
to it.
   2. 20O grains of the same peels were moderately roasted,
and being  afterwards digested with three ounces of water,
formed    a    dark brown decoction,         which was not rendered
turbid by gelatine.
   3. The above-mentioned roasted peels, after the termina
tion of the preceding experiment, were added to the re
mainder of the filtrated liquor. A quarter of an ounce of
nitric acid was poured upon the whole, which was then di
gested and evaporated      to dry ness.      The    mass w as afterwards
infused in water, and a dark reddish-brown    I'u;utd was ob
tained, which copiously precipitated solution of isinglass.
   4. 200 grains of horse chestnuts, from whii-h the peels
employed in the former experiments had been tafcen, were
bruised, and were digested with three ounces of water. The
liquor was turbid, and of          a    pate red colour.        It was fil
trated, and some solution        of isinglass was added, but with
out any effect.
   5. 200 grains of the same horse chestnuts were moderately
roasted, and being treated as above described with water,
yielded a dark brown decoction which was not rendered tur
bid by isinglass.
   6. The horse chestnuts,which had been employed in the
preceding experiment with the remaining liquor, wt're di
gested with a quarter of an ounce of nitric acid until the
whole was become dry.    Water was then poured upon                      it,
was digested, and    dark brown liquid was formed, which
                       a
afforded   considerable precipitate
           a                                  by
                                      the addition of solu
tion of isinglass.
   From these experiments         it   appears,    that the small portion
                                   E4                                    of

72         Experiments     on a Substance   ukich   possesses
of tannin which the horse chestnut        peels  originally contained,
was destroyed by the process of roasting ; that the brown
decoction subsequently obtained from the roasted peels and
 from the horse chestnuts, did not act upon gelatine; but
 that these were speedily converted into the artificial tanning
 substance, by the addition of a small portion of nitric acid
and subsequent evaporation.
    The first preparations of the artificial tanning substance
which     have been mentioned in the former papers, were made
from coal of different descriptions digested with nitric acid ;
and as similar products have been obtained by the same acid
from various decoctions of roasted vegetable substances,
there cannot       be any     doubt,  that vegetable     bodies when
roasted, yield solutions by digestion in water, which essen
tially consist of carbon approaching to the state of coal, al
though not absolutely converted into it; for, if so, all solubi
lity in water would cease.
    But coal is apparently nothing more        than carbon oxidized
to   a certain degree,    and   may be formed       by the humid as
well   as  by the dry way.
    Examples have been already stated respecting operations
in which sulphuric acid has produced this effect, but the
same likewise      appears   to be produced     with some modifica
tions,    whenever vegetable matter undergoes the putrefactive
process; for when this takes place, as in dunghills, &c. a
large proportion of the carbon of the original vegetable sub
stances     appears  to be combined      with oxygen sufficient to
communicate to it many of the properties of coal, whilst the
compound nevertheless is capable of being dissolved by water
with    the most perfect    facility.
    It must not however be understood that by this process all
the other elementary principles arc separated, so that only
the carbon remains combined with oxygen, but merely, that
the other principles are so far diminished,        that these, namely
carbon and oxygen, predominate in a state approaching               to
coal, although soluble in water.
    Such solutions,     1  have every reason to believe, are nearly
similar to those afforded by vegetable       substances    which have
been previously roasted;        and although    I have examined but
                                                                a few

              the characteristic Properties     of Tannin.            73
a. few of them, yet I shall relate some experiments which I
have lately made on the peels of walnuts.
    It is well known that when these are kept in small heaps
for a short time, they become soft, and break down into a
black mass, which affords a brownish-black liquor.                   On
these I therefore made the following experiments :
    1.  About one ounce of walnut peels, which were become
 soft and black,     was digested in water.
    Adark brown liquor was thus formed, and, being filtrated*
was examined by a solution of isinglass, but not any appa
rent effect was produced.
    2.  On   an equal quantity     of the walnut   peels,  in the same
soft black state,     a small portion of nitric acid was poured,
and after being digested for about five hours, the whole was
evaporated to dryness.          The residuum was of a brownish
orange colour, and yielded a similar coloured solution to
water when digested with it. This was filtrated, and upon
the addition      of solution     of isinglass   became    turbid, and
deposited a tough precipitate,        which was not dissolved by
boiling water.
    3. Another portion of the walnut           peels was moderately
roasted,    and   was   then   digested  in water  ; the brown    solu
tion    was filtrated,    and formed a slight precipitate with
gelatine.
    4. On the residuum of the last experiment, a small quan
tity of nitric acid was poured, some water was then added,
the whole was digested during about five hours, and until it
became perfectly dry.
   Water formed with this           a brown liquor, which yielded
a very abundant         precipitate   by the addition of dissolved
isinglass.
    Upon    these experiments we may remark, that the solution
in   the first instance contained carbon      in  a state approaching
to coal, for when treated with nitric acid in the second ex
periment,      a portion (although small) was produced of the
same tanning substance which is formed from the different
kinds    of coal by nitric acid.
   The third experiment       appears to show, that a small quan
                                                                    tity

 74          Experiments on a Substance                           which possesses
tity of a substance approaching to tannin was produced by
the simple process of roasting ; and the fourth experiment
corroborates those already described, in which the artificial
tanning matter was copiously produced, whenever roasted
vegetablesubstances were treated wiih nitric acid.
      In   respect to vegetable substances, especially those                             which
contain tannin,                I few other experiments.
                                    shall here relate        a
   It has been remarked in my second paper, that the
tannin of galls was immediately destroyed by nitric acid.
Since that time,                    I   have made      the       following additional      ex
periments        :
   1. 100 grains of galls reduced  to powder were infused
with four ounces of water, and part of the infusion upon the
addition of solution                    of isinglass   afforded      (as usual) a copious
precipitate          of   a   brownish-white colour.
   A       quarter of              an    ounce of nitric acid was added to one
ounce of the above                       infusion, which then was not in any
manner affected by the dissolved isinglass.
      2.   100 grains          of       the same galls were slightly roasted,              and
being digested                with four ounces of water, formed                     a    brown
liquor, which was filtrated.
   Solution of isinglass was then added to a part of the above
liquor, and produced a precipitate not very unlike the
former,  but much less in quantity.
   After this, a quarter of an ounce of nitric acid was added
to one ounce of the same liqnor, and some dissolved isin
glass was subsequently poured into                     it; by which it was ren
dered tnrbid,             and a         small portion of a dark brown precipi
tate was  produced, resembling that which is commonly
afforded by the artificial tanning substance.
   3. The remainder                       of the above-mentioned               liquor,    with
the residuum                  of
                               galls, were digested with a
                                    the    roasted
quarter of an ounce of nitric acid until the whole had be
come dry.    Water was then poured upon         and formed              it,                 a
dark brown solution, which yielded      copious brown preci      a
pitate     by   the addition              of dissolved isinglass.
   From these experiments on galls   appears, that the natu  it
ral tannin contained in them      destroyed     nitric acid
                                                     is                   by                ;
                                                                                          that

                the characteristic Properties     of Tannin.           75
  that the tannin is also diminished,          and  (I may add,)    is ul
  timately destroyed by the process of roasting; that when
  galls have not been so far roasted as to destroy the whole of
  the tannin, then the remainder           of this seems to be destroy
  ed by the addition of       nitric acid,  whilst  at the same time a
  small portion of the artificial tanning substance is produced ;
  and that this last is always plentifully afforded by roasted
  galls when digested with nitric acid, similar to other vege
   table bodies when thus treated.
      These remarks are also partly confirmed by the following
  experiments upon oak bark.
       1.  200 grains of oak bark, reduced into very small frag
  ments, were infused in about four ounces of water, after
  which     the infusion was examined by dissolved isinglass, and
  yielded    a considerable precipitate.
      2. 200 grains of the same sort of bark were slightly roasted,
   and afterwards digested in water ; a much darker coloured
   liquor was obtained than in the former case ; but although
   it  afforded   precipitates by the addition of muriate of tin»
   acetite of lead, and sulphate of iron, yet not the smallest
'
   effect was produced by solution        of isinglass.
       3. The residuum, with the remaining part of the above-
   mentioned liquor, was then digested with a small portion of
   nitric acid; this was completely evaporated, and a brown
   solution was formed by water, which abundantly precipi
   tated gelatine.
       4. One ounce of oak bark, reduced into very small frag
    ments, was repeatedly digested in different portions of water
    ontil the whole of its tannin was extracted. The residnur<i
    or exhausted bark      (as it is called by the tanners) was dried,
    and was afterwards moderately roasted.            It was then moist
    ened    with diluted nitric acid, which was evaporated in a
    heat not much exceeding 300° until the bark was become
    perfectly dry. This was digested in water, and speedily
    formed a yellowish-brown liquor, which abundantly preci
    pitated gelatine.
       5. The bark,      which after being        exhausted   of its na
    tural   tannin  hud   thus afforded     the artificial  tanning sub
                                                                   stance,

  76             Experiments      on a Substance,  &c.
 Stance,   was repeatedly     treated with water until the whole   of
 this last was extracted.        The bark was then again slightly
 roasted, was again moistened with nitric acid, and was
 gently heated and dried as before. Water being poured on
 it and digested, formed a brown solution, which copiously
 precipitated gelatine.
     6. The whole of the artificial tanning substance was ex
 tracted by different portions of water, and the remainder of
 the bark    thus exhausted, was again treated in the manner
 above described, and again afforded a considerable quantity
 of the tanning substance,        so that these processes  evidently
might    have   been continued until the whole      of the bark had
been converted into     it.
    This might also have been accomplished, if in the first
instance the exhausted bark had been converted into char
coal, and digested in nitric acid, as described in my first
paper ; but then, the effects would hare been more slowly
produced, and much more nitric acid would have been con
sumed.      I am now therefore fully convinced, not only by
the results   of the experiments related in this paper, but also
by many others which it would have been superfluous to
have stated,    that the most speedy and most ceconomical of
all the processes which I have described, is that of treating
roasted vegetable substances in the way which has been
mentioned ; and considering that all refuse vegetable matter
may be thus converted into a tanning substance by means
the most simple, and without any expensive apparatus,
I   cannot h>lp entertaining much hope, that eventually
this discovery will be productive of some real public ad
vantage.

    Mrs.  A. B.,  aet. 62, has had an umbilical hernia for thirty
years, which has been attended with much pain and incon
venience, from its size and irreducible state, during the
greatest part  of  the above period, as the contents    of the her-
nial  sac have not been      returned completely into the cavity
of  the abdomen for twenty years      ; but the size of the tumour
has always increased      considerably after standing or walking,
from which she suffered much.
    Dec. 6, 1806, Mr. Skinner was called to visit the above
 patient, and found her in great pain about the umbilical re
gion, arising from inflammation of the contents of the her-
nial sac and parictes of the abdomen.         She had not had any
evacuation by stool for some days ; was continually sick, and
vomited every thing from the stomach as soon as it was
 taken.

    Anodyne fomentations were applied to the umbilical           re
 gion, and an enema was administered immediately.
    Dec. 7-   No mitigation of symptoms : the enema was re
 turned,  without   any feculent matter ; and the vomiting con
 tinued as before.      Six leeches were applied to the tumour;

     the fomentations were continued, and an enema           of nicotiana
     was administered.
         Dec. 8. Mr. Skinner requested mc to accompany him in
     his visit to this patient. No evacuation by stool had been
     procured, nor had any sleep been obtained during the night,
     and every thing was rejected by the stomach as soon as
     taken    ; but the pulse was softer than on the preceding day,
     was regular, and did not exceed eighty beats in a minute :
     the enema of nicotiana was repeated, the fomentations were
     continued,      and the following pills were ordered :

            secunda quaque hora.
         Dec. 9. The poor sufferer was evidently worse in every
     respect : feculent matter was now vomited in large quanti
     ties, and the hiccup       had  distressed  the  patient extremely
     through the night.       The operation was no sooner proposed
     than acceded to ; and it was agreed that it should be per
     formed at nine P.     M.  ; and was   done in the presence    of Mr.
     Skinner, Mr. Hilliard, and Mr. Burgis.          She underwent the
     operation with great fortitude and resignation, which was
    prolonged considerably by the vast adhesions of the omentum,
    to every part of the sac ; and it was not till a separation had
    been made in the substance          of the omentum      that the fold
    of    the   intestine contained   in the sac could be exposed to
    View ; when il was found         of a dark colour, but not gan
    grenous ; and was readily returned on dilating the stricture
    at the mouth of the sac.         This part of the operation was
    attended       with more difficulty than usually occurs, in part
    from the mouth of the sac being extremely deep seated, and
    in   part from the very extensive adhesions of the omentum
    to the peritoneum around that part of the intestine where
    the stricture was formed : the firm adhesion of the omentum
    to every part of the internal surface of the sac prevented its
    being returned into the abdomen, and rendered the removal

after the operation as could possibly have been expected
from its severity in point of time, though much pain was
not experienced, as the omentum is not a very sensible or
gan.     The     pulse was languid,              and did not exceed   70.

four hours.        The      cough is much relieved.           Has had two na
tural evacuations by stool.   Pulse about S0, but scarcely
perceptible, and intermits at irregular intervals. She is
much lower than yesterday, being only capable of articu
lating in  kind of whisper; but has not experienced much,
             a
pain, excepting a little smarting in the wound occasionally.
Medicines        continued.

   Dec. 14. She appears extremely                       low: the articulation
more indistinct         :    the pulse less perceptible,        but intermits as

 appetite is returning t and she is now able to sit up some
 hours daily.    The anodyne draught omitted.
     Dec. 18. Dressed the wound, from which there is a small
 discharge^ but no other inconvenience : pulse regular.
     Dec. 20. A little smarting pain has been experienced in
 the wound, from inflammation and excoriation of the inte
guments.      The ung. sperm, ceti was applied, and an ape
 rient medicine was taken .
     Dec. 21, 82. The inflammation is nearly reduced, and
the general health much improved.
     Dec. 24 — 26. Continues to mend : the wound completely
healed.
    Dec. 29. Perfectly recovered.
    In the recovery of this patient there were two remarkable
occurrences:    the intermission   of the pulse, which began on
the second and continued to the eighth day after the opera
tion ; and the extreme debility, or inability to move or speak     :
even    the motion   of the hand excited    an uneasy sensation,
and    an attempt to articulate distressed     the patient exceed
ingly.    Might not   these   symptoms    take  place partly from
peritoneal inflammation     ?
    Several cases have recently occurred, in winch, on the ex
hibition of small  doses of calomel combined with jalap, the
mercurial salivation has suddenly appeared, and in some in
stances   has been continued even to an alarming extent.
    In one instance, four grains of calomel     and sixteen grainB
of jalap were divided into four pills, one    of which   was taken
every third   morning, and    operated as a moderate cathartic,
generally occasioning    two   or three extra evacuations in the
day ; which was also succeeded by ptyalism, that continued
upwards of three weeks, and evidently arose from the mercury.
                                                                Jn

    In another         case,   six grainy of calomel and twenty-four
 grains of jalap were divided into six pills,            one of which was
 taken every second morning, and operated as a powerful
 cathartic : at the end of ten days the gums became tender,
 and the saliva          was secreted    in   a large  quantity.    The last
 pill  was     taken    on the eleventh day, and I was requested to
 see the patient on the 14th              day; when the head and face
 were much swollen,             the tongue, gums, and inside of the
 cheeks     were     ulcerated    very extensively, the saliva flowing
 in a profuse manner.             No food could be taken, not even in
 a fluid state.        The unfavourable symptoms continued to in
 crease   till  the    20th day, when locked jaw came on, and the
 patient was        in   the most imminent danger.            No medicine
 could be taken, nor even a gargle used, at this time.                 More
benefit appeared           to be derived from the use of steam, by
holding the head over warm water, than by all the medi
cines which         had been exhibited      ;  and   although   the  patient
began      to mend on the 26th day, yet the effects            of  the mer
cury did not disappear for upwards of a month.
    Many cases similar to the above have come under my care
within a few months ; and although it is well known that
very small doses          of calomel will occasionally produce sali
vation,     this seldom takes place when it acts as a cathartic,
or when it is exhibited in combination with any other me
dicine having that property and producing that effect.
   These facts would not have been noticed publicly, but
from their frequent recurrence, without any apparent pecu
liarity of constitution, from the same combination of me
dicine, which I have been in the habit of prescribing for
many years,         as  well in public as in private practice, and
have rarely witnessed effects similar to the above.

vanes or wings, which lave in the water            of   a  circular cistern
or well.     In justice to a very ingenious man, Mr. William.
Robert, of the neighbourhood of Swansea, in South Wales,
I beg to mention that a regulator on this principle was con
trived by him, and executed in 1793; since which the same
has been employed, with the most perfect success, in Messrs.
Lockwood and company's collieries, where the coals from
the upper veins of the mountain require to be let down in
large quantities to the trainway tunnel below, in order to
their being conveyed out of the hill to the navigation.                It is
difficult  to conceive any regulator better adapted for harm
lessly destroying the immense power generated by the long
and almost constant descent of large baskets of coals in these
mines;    the velocity   of the descent being adjustible to the
greatest  nicety   by  means    of cocks, which let in or out water
from the regulator well, as occasion may require : at the
same time permit me to remark, that few situations seem
less adapted for this      kind of regulator, or rather destroyer
of power, than the one in which Mr. Eckhardt has exhi
bited it in the work above quoted, where the expensive and
cruelly-excited labour of animals ought to have been more
(economically     regulated.     A  more serious defect attends         Mr.
Eckhardt's     mode   of applying     the labour   of animals, viz. on
the outside of      a  walking-wheel,       owing to the increase of
power, (instead     of its decrease,) whenever the animal abates
its muscular exertion, and the wheel is moving, as on all
occasions of ceasing work.          This will evidently appear'from
an inspection    of  the 21st plate as above     ;  where an ox is re
presented standing with his fore feet upon a stage fixed nearly
over, but a little before the top of a walking-wheel,                 while
his hind legs    rest  and  act  on  the  wheel  at   a   considerable di-
itance beyond its top.           Whenever the animal's hind legs
happen, by the motion of the wheel, to be carried further
than usual from his fore legs, how is he to recover himself?
Not only will the weight of 'his hind quarters, acting on an
increased radius, accelerate its motion, but his hind legs,
 brought continually nearer into the direction of a tangent to
 the wheel, will gice his muscular exertion an increasing ef
 fect on the     wheel   as   he   endeavours    to prevent the pro-
                                   F   2                           gressive

president, in the        chair. — Continuation         of Dr. Herschel's
paper     on  the  coloured    concentric     rings* seen through thin
plates or lenses. The doctor detailed a great variety of expe
riments made with lenses of 120 feet focus down to those of
the most common glasses.               The colours of these rings seen
through the lens of 120 feet were black and white; those
through one of 40, were red ; those through one of 14, were
violet, Sec.       Thus these concentric rings, which through a
glass    of  one  focus   appeared black, through another appeared
blue, and so on throughout the whole series of tlie prismatic
colours.       The author drew no conclusions from these facts,
nor    d.id he attempt to classify them in any manner tending
 to elucidate the nature of the phenomena, or the peculiar
influence of glasses of different densities on the transmissi-
bility of light.
    Feb. 5. Right hon. C. F. Greville, vice-president, in the
 chair. — The reading of the above paper was concluded. The
 doctor made numerous other experiments, all of which tended
 to establish the fact, that light could not have, as sir Isaac
 Newton supposed, Jits of easy transmission or reflection ;
 and    that therefore      this phenomenon of concentric rings
 must be ascribed        to another cause, which he proposed to

contrary to what is common                in other carnivorous animals,
had stomachs composed of four cavities, or bags, through
which the food passed before it was prepared to form chyle.
Mr. Home, although          he has examined,            he says,    several  of
these animals,     and    in the     present     instance has dissected a
bottle-nosed porpoise, which had six of these bags consti
tuting its stomach, has succeeded only in ascertaining the
relative dimensions of these parts, without being able to
assign any satisfactory cause           for such an important differ
ence   of organical structure.

    The reading of Mr. Greathead's dissertation on the abori
ginal Britons was concluded.            The author, from an exten
sive view of the facts, established the following conclusion :
that the first inhabitants of Britain were neither Celts, Scan
dinavians, nor Gauls; but Cantabrians, originally and di
rectly descended from aboriginal Spaniards.              He traced the
manners of the people of Cornwall and those on the oppo
site coast of Brittany, and also llie particular district in Eng
land where he conceived the Cantabrians had originally set
tled, whence they migrated lo Ireland : the latter island, he
observed, was never visited by the Romans, and consequently
its manners and language were unknown to them.                    The
great similarity   between     the Irish and the modern Spaniards
of Biscay,    the descendants       of the fierce Cantabri, tends
considerably to confirm the author's plausible hypothesis.

Mr. Lysons     read some extracts       from the public records, par
ticularly  a letter from Richard III. to the lord chancellor,
bishop of Lincoln, in which that monarch describes the
character and conduct of Buckingham, and declares his de
termination of having him executed a* a traitor; which he
soon after effected.     In this curious      letter  he required  and
received  the great seal from the bishop, and kept it himself
from the month of October till the middle of the following
year, during which time he issued several orders as chan
cellor, and established many useful institutions; after which
he delivered up the great seal, it appears, not to the same
but to another bishop of Lincoln.            This letter, accompanied
by Mr. Lysons's remarks, tends to give us a much more fa
vourable idea of Richard'* character than is usually enter*
tained.

                   [Continued from our last volume, p. .173.]
    M. Thenard, professor in the College of France, has com
pletely discovered in bile a saccharine matter the existence
of which       has been hitherto only suspected,              and the properly
of which       is to hold the oil      of   the bile in solution.      The   me
thods of analysis which he has employed have been remarked,
by the committee charged with the examination of his la
bours,    singularly ingenious ; in fact, it was extremely dif
         as
ficult completely to free this substance from those which dis
guised it.
  M. Seguin, a corresponding member of the Institute, has
made some researches on the nature of coffee; whence it
results, that this grain is composed of albumen, oil, a par
ticular substance which he has named the bitter principle,
                 which is merely a combination of the al
and a green matter
bumen with the bitter principle; that the proportions vary
in the different kinds           of coffee ;
                                         roasting increases the
                                                that
proportion of the bitter principle by destroying the albumen;
that these two latter principles contain plenty of azote ; and
that the bitter principle is antiseptic. The oil of coffee is
inodorous, congelable, and white like hog's lard.
   M. Seguin afterwards examined if albumen was not to be
found in other vegetables; and he discovered   in short, in     it,
a great number, which he specifies.  The most of them also
contain, in certain proportions,               a   bitter principle,   mure or
less similar to that of coffee.
    This remarkable quantity of albumen being                   met with par
ticularly in such vegetable juices as ferment and yield   spi            a
rituous liquor    themselves without yeast, such as the juice
                       by
of raisins, gooseberries, &c. &c., M. Seguin was led to
inquire  ifthe albumen contributed any tiling to this                          in
testine commotive fermentation, hitherto so little known.
He   states,  haring taken the albumen from these juices
                that
they are no longer capable  of fermenting    and that having
                                                          ;
made albumen artificially, with the white of an egg and sac
charine matter for instance,                fermentation took place, when
other circumstances             were   besides    convenient for it; and
                                       F4                                    there

 fit                   French National Institute.
  there   was   always deposited a matter like yeast, which ap
  peared to    him   to be nothing else than an altered albumen
  becime almost insoluble, without losing, on that account,
  its ferment ing action; whence he concludes that albumen,
 whether animal or vegetable, is the true ferment.
     M. Seguin has further ascertained that albumen is found
 in three different degrees of insolubility and dispositions of
 becoming fibrous; that the more it is soluble the more ener
 getic is its action ; that the respective proportions of albu
 men and sugar in the different juices are whatdetermines the
 vinous or acetic      nature  of the produce  of the fermentation,
 it being so much the more spirituous the more sugar it con
 tains ; and lastlv, that the most of the fermentable juices
 contain    a bitter principle analogous to that of coffee, which
 goes   for  nothing in the fermentation, but which contributes
to the taste and the preservation of the fermented liquor.
     Tannin,    that   vegetable  principle formerly discovered by
M. Seguin, and the character of which is to form with ge
 latine an insoluble compound, has been recently examined
by M. Bouillon Lagrange,           professor in the Napoleon    Ly
ceum.
     He   has   found in it an affinity for the alkalis, for the
earths, and metallic oxides, and the faculty of converting
itself into gallic    acid by absorbing oxygen.
     The tannins,    as they are extracted from (he various vege
tables, vary a little in their composition ; and that which
Mr. Hatchett, the English chemist, has discovered in caout
chouc is a little more oxygenated than the others.
     An Italian chemist, M. Morichini, having discovered the
fluoric acid in the enamel of the fossil grinders of the ele
phant, analysed that of the human tceih, and thought he
discovered the same principle.           M. Gay-Lussac has found
it alsb both in the fresh and fossil ivory, and in the tusks of
the boar.
     Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin have repeated these ex
periments, and have actually obtained this acid from tusks
and teeth altered by their remaining        in the earth ; but not
from fresh       tusks or teeth,  nor even from those    which,  al
though fossil,      had not been altered.

  M. Vauquelin          has this year made some experiments upon
hair*.
      The method of imitating                    the alum of Rome, discovered
last year,    has been so successful that immense quantities                               of
it   have been sold for true Roman alum.
      We   are indebted to Messrs. Clement and Desormes for this
discovery; and it merely consists in calcining and re-cry
stallizing  to take its superabundant acid. M. Curaudeau,
              it,
however, asserts that      still necessary to oxygenate to the
                                  it   is
maximum the little iron the alum generally contains.
  But in more recent memoir Messrs. Thenard and Roard
             a
have finished the investigation                 of this subject:  single mil- a
licme of iron influences the                 effect of alum in dyeing: every
effort of the manufacturer ought therefore to be used to de
prive    of this small quantity of iron. The oxygenation of
        it
the iron    one method, as
             is                renders   insoluble in the acid;

and the alums ihus purified are equal in every respect to the
alums      of Rome.
   Contagious miasma has been ably combated        the oxy                        by
genated muriatic acid gas. This preservative, for which  we
are    indebted to      M. Guyton,                 is   very       generally employed.
M.     Desgenettes ascertained               its    effects        by some very careful
experiments in the military hospital at Val-de-Grace and                               ;
it results, from the comparative tables he has sent us, that
these fumigations not only prevent the communication of
the disease,        but appear to be of great efficacy in the cure.'
     M. Pinel       has been equally successful    in the Hospital of
Salpctriere.
   The public have recently been informed, through the me
dium of the journals, how successful this preservative has
been in Spain, and of the presents which have been made                                    by
the king to those who have used it.      We know also the
honourable recompense given                         by   our emperor to the prin
cipal author of the discovery.
     From    the journals also, and from the other extremity                               of
our continent,        we have been informed                    of     the full success     of
the process,        proposed           by M. Berthollet,                  to preserve water

 which transmits      the vessels which come from the trunk and
 which nourish the grain, also gives passage to other channels
 which descend from the pistil, shoot out opposite the small
 root of the emlmon, and carry to it the fecundating prin
 ciple by the stigma of the powder of the stamina. There is
 seen on all the grains a small aperture called mycropila by
 M. Turpin,      and to which he attributes this      function.

    At  the anniversary     of the above Academy         on the 7th    of
 August   last, the  following distinguished foreigners were pro
 claimed    members     of the Institution : M. Cuvier, member
 of the French Institute ; Sir Joseph Banks, president of
the Royal Society of London ; M. Goethe, privy counsellor
to the duke of Weimar, and author of IVertcr ; M. Zoega,

    The Academy       at the same meeting awarded         prizes to two
memoirs upon the structure and functions            of the lungs   ; the
one by M. Rcisseissen, a physician of Strasbourg ; and the
other by M. Soemmering, privy counsellor to the king of
Bavaria. The class of mathematics of the Academy declared
that they had received nothing satisfactory upon the problem,
relative to the variations in the obliquity of the ecliptic. The
time has been therefore enlarged for giving in the memoirs
on the subject, to two years longer.              The Academy        has

    At  the  meeting of the above       Academy on the 12th      of
October     1 806,  professor Strohmeyer,      resident member   of
the Academy, read a part of the results of extensive chemi
cal researches upon the union of hydrogen with the metals.
He particularly examined in this memoir the union of hy
drogen and arsenic.       He made several experiments upon the
most striking phenomena presented by arsenical hydrogen
gas. Professor Osiander afterwards presented to the museum
of Gottingen a small phial filled with sand from the diamond
mine of Bansor Massing in the Island of Borneo, which he
had received from one of his countrymen, M. Haas, who
returned from India in 1802.          M. Haas served as chaplain
to a Wirtemberg regimtnt in the pay of Holland, which
had been sent to the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence
to Java and Ctylon.          When he undertook this voyage,
 George    Forster,  who  then  lived at Mentz, gave him various
instructions, both verbally and in writing, upon the manner
in which he ought to conduct himself, and particularly
upon objects of natural history.         According to the instruc
tions of Forster, M. Haas endeavoured among other objects
to procure some sand from the diamond mines in Borneo,
hitherto inaccessible to Europeans.            For this purpose he
applied to one of his countrymen in the service of the Dutch
 in the Indies.     This latter gentleman found means to ob
 tain from     the  Sultan of Borneo a quantity of the sand of
 these mines, which he divided with          M. Haas, who imme
 diately sent some of it to the National Institute, and to a
 Spanish governor, Emmanuel D'Agota : the remainder, with
the exception of a small part which he had concealed in a
 box of tea, was taken from him along with other things by
 the commander of a French privateer, who captured the
 vessel in which he sailed on his return to the Isle     of France.
                                                                  It

    It was this small quantity which M. Haas, on his return to
    the Cape, sent to M. Osiander, his friend and countryman ;
    who in his turn presented the greatest part of it to the museum
    of Gottingen, as a rarity worthy the attention of naturalists.
    This sand resembles that found in      the other   diamond mines
    of Golconda, Visapour, &c. and         is  of a reddish and ferru
    ginous yellow.

a piece of frontal bone, weigh 31 lbs. and measure from tip

XVII.     Description of Mr. Ez. WALKER'S new                   Optical
               Machine called the Phantasmascope.
                            To Mr. TillocIt.
       SIR,
A    MONG the various amusements that the sciences afford
us, none are more wonderful           than those      which we derive
from optics. This science teaches us to distrust the evi
dence of our senses ; for when we use optic glasses, instead
of viewing    real objects,    we generally see nothing but phan
toms.
    The new optical machine, of which I now take the liberty
to send you an account, is constructed to afford entertain
ment to those who derive pleasure from optical illusions.
A   person standing before this machine,           sees a door opened   ;
a phantom makes         its appearance,     coining towards him, and
increasing in magnitude as        it approaches. When it has ad
vanced about three feet it appears of the greatest magnitude,
but as it returns it becomes gradually contracted in its di
mensions      until it re-enters the machine ; when it totally
vanishes.      This phantom appears in the air like a beautiful
painting,    and  in such rich brilliancy of colouring, that it is
by no means necessary to make the room dark ; for, on the
contrary, this aerial picture is seen rather in greater perfec
 tion when it is illuminated.
    This machine, whic.h may be called the phantasmascnpe,
from the effects which it produces, is constructed in the fol
 lowing manper      :
    Plate III.  represents    a section  of this machine.
    ABCD,       a wooden box, 36 inches by 21, and 22 deep.
    E F,  a  concave mirror,      l 5 inches diameteryfcplaced      near
 the end   BD,
    A C,   the other end, is divided into         two parts at in by an
horizontal bar, of which m is a section.

 covered with plate glass on that side next the mirror.

 98     New Optical Machine called the Phantasmascope.
    G  H I,    a drawer, open at the end         I, and covered    at the top
 Gm with tin plate.            It  is represented    in the figure  as   drawn
 out about      16 inches.
    a b, a moveable stage,           15 inches by 6, which slides freely
upou the bottom of the drawer by means of a strong brass
 rod ca.
    dx,    a partition fixed to the stage ali, which is 15 inches
long,     and reaches nearly to the top of the drawer.
    x, a circular aperture, 3 or 4 inches in diameter, made
near the bottom of the partition, and at equal distances from
each end of it.
    za,    a screen   7-J-  inches high by 4-}-, covered with white
paper on that side next the mirror.                  This screen prevents
any light, reflected from the end of the drawer, from passing
through the aperture x.
    np, part of the cover, fixed as represented in the figure,
to prevent the inside of the machine from being seen by the
observer.
    When this machine            is used,    take a painting    on glass in
transparent colours, place it against                the aperture x in the
partition on that side next the mirror, and two short candles
on the other side,         between     za   and  dx.     The  glass must be
perfectly opaque, except that              part upon which the figure is
painted ; then the light which is transmitted through the
painting and falls upon the mirror, is reflected into the air
where the phantom is formed ; but the phantom is much
more beautiful than           the    painting,   as the  colouring   receives
a peculiar delicacy from the glasses.
   When        the  painting      is  in the    place   represented     in the
figure,    the phantom appears without the machine at                  y  ; but
if the stage be drawn out to the end of the drawer G H, the
phantom wtll appear within the machine at r, and very
small.      A   very pleasing effect is also produced from a small
painting     ,on paper, or a coloured print put in the place
of the painting on glass, with              candles on the other side,
near   I.
                                                                Application

              On the characteristic Properties              of Tannin.            99
  Application of the machine to represent the phases of the
     moon, primary planets, and some other phenomena, in the
     heavens*.        This,     I trust, will be easily understood from
     the following
                                      EXAMPLE.
     To represent Jupiter and his satellites as they appear
  through a common telescope, take a piece of paper stained
  very black, about three inches square, near the middle of
  which cut a hole, perfectly circular, to represent the planet,
  and four small holes, in a line with the centre of the large
 one, for the satellites          ;   but these must be cut out with               a
 small punch,       as  it is difficult to make         a   circular hole with     a
 sharp-pointed       instrument.           After this   paper has been pasted
 upon a piece of glass, rough ground on one side, draw
 ihree or four lines across the planet with a black lead pencil
 to imitate the belts.           From this simple contrivance the ma
 chine produces a very beautiful effect.                   The new moon re
 presented this way is a striking resemblance of the real ob
jects in the heavens         :  comets and fixed stars may also be re
 presented by the same method.
    The colour of Mars and of the moon, at rising or setting,
 may be imitated by covering the screen xa with paper stained
 red, which will reflect            a  ruddy tint upon the object placed
at x; and this tint may be increased or decreased by only
 altering the situations of the candles.                 I am, sir,
      Lynn,                             Your most humble servant,

                                         §  V.
J.N my first        paper     I  have      remarked,      that   I suspected   the
tannin of the peat moors to have been produced during the
   • These                are represented much more exactly by this machine,
            phenomena
{hatl by any  other that  1 am acquainted with.

100         Ex per linen Is    on a Substance      which possesses
imperfect carbonization of the original vegetable substances.
Whether this has been the case, or whether the tannin has
at times been afforded by heath and other vegetables growing
upon or near the peat, still appears to me to be uncertain 3
but, whatever may be the origin, I have never yet been able
 to detect     any tanning substance in peat, although I have
examined        a considerable number of varieties, some from
Berkshire,       and many from Lancashire, which were obli
gingly sent to me for this purpose by my friend John
Walker, esq. F.R.S. Mr. Jameson has also made the same
 obseivation     *, so that there cannot be any doubt (whatever
 the origin of the tanning matter may have been) that it has
 speedily been extracted and drained from the substances
 which at first contained it.
    This effect is a natural consequence of                 the great    facility
 with which tannin is dissolved by water,                    and extends     even
 to the most solid vegetable bodies : I shall here give an ex
 ample.
     In the Philosophical Transactions for 1 799> Dr. Correa
 de Serra has given an account                 of the submarine forest at
 Sutton,     on the coast      of Lincolnshire, where submerged ve
 getables     are found      in great    abundance, including trees             of
 different descriptions, especially birch, fir, and oak.                  At the
 time when I was engaged in those experiments on the Bovey
 coal, and other substances           of  a similar      nature, which have
 been    printed in      the    Philosophical      Transactions      for 1804,
 Sir Joseph Banks          had    the goodness       to send     me a piece     of
 the oak, which was perfect in all of its vegetable characters,
 and did not appear to have suffered any change, excepting
 that it was harder, and of           a  darker colour, than recent oak
 wood.      From    some experiments which             I  then made,    I  found
 that after incineration it afforded            potash, similar to the re
 cent wood, and contrary to substances like the Bovey coal,
 which retain the vegetable external characters, although im
 perfectly converted into coal f-

about an ounce         of this submerged oak into shavings,                        and
digested    them in water.             A   brown         decoction was formed,
which with muriate of tin afforded           a pale brown precipitate;
with    acetite   of   lead,    aprecipitate of a deeper brown ; with
sulphate of iron, a         copious brownish-black precipitate; but
with solution of isinglass not any                effect was produced.
   The tannin of this oak wood                      had       therefore either been
separated by solution, or had been decomposed ; so that the
only substance which remained capable of being dissolved
by water was the extractive matter. This last, in the pre
sent case, was most probably the original extractive matter
of the oak    ;but in some other instances (such, for example,
as   that which was found in the alder leaves contained in the
Iceland schistus*,)            lam much inclined to believe that an
extractive substance            of a secondary formation, if I may be
permitted to employ such a term, is produced during the
process of carbonization. If a substance, therefore, so com
pact and solid as oak timber can by long submersion be de
prived of its tannin, it naturally follows that the same effect
must be more speedily produced by the action of water on
the smaller vegetable bodies, which present an extensive sur
face ; and also on porous and bibulous substances, such as
peat.
   But although peat, as I have already observed, does not
contain any tannin, yet the imperfect carbonization which
it has undergone renders            it,
                            like the roasted ligneous bodies,
peculiarly susceptible of being converted into the artificial
tanning substance when exposed to the action of nitric acid.
It   would be useless to enter into             a   detail      of    the different ex
periments which        I    have made upon               it,   as    they were similar
to those already related; and shall therefore only here state,
                                       I

moistened, and digested with diluted nitric acid, (to the
amount of rather more than two ounces,) and subsequently

102          Experiments on a Substance                    which possesses
ounces.   I am convinced that much more might have been
obtained from the residuum of the peat, had I thought proper
to have repeated the operation ; and I am also certain that
less nitric acid would have been sufficient, had the process
been conducted in close vessels, and with other ceconomical
precautions, which at that time were, for the sake of expe
dition and convenience, omitted.
                                        §   VI.
   It has been generally stated, even by modern chemists,
that the acids act but little,  at all, upon resinous si1b-
                                            it'
stances.
     The contrary has, however,                 been proved, not only in the
three papers upon the present subject, but also in srnnc others
which      I   have   formerly had the honour                  to lay before     this
learned society.
     In my experiments             on    lac, printed in the Phil. Trans.
for   1   804, p. 208,   I   have       particularly endeavoured             to show
how powerfully        the acetic acid acts upon resin, gluten,                   and
some other substances         ;    so that        it   may    justly    be regarded
as   valuable agent
      a                       in   the chemical             analysis of vegetable
bodies.  In this point             of view,            is   as   solvent to be the
                                                   it it
                                                              a
more highly appreciated, because       appears to dissolve the
resins, &.c. without affecting their respective qualities; and
thus, by proper precipitants, these substances may be sepa
rated from   pure and unaltered.
               it
 I    am induced, therefore, to consider acetic acid to be the
true acid solvent ot the  resinous substances, as    dissolves          it
them speedily, without producing any apparent subsequent
change in their natural properties.
     Sulphuric acid, also, almost immediately                          dissolves the
resins, balsams, 8cc. and forms transparent brown or some
times crimson solutions,            the latter colour being most com
monly characteristic of            the balsams.
   These solutions, however, are different from those made
in the acetic acid,          by
                        not being permanent    for, from the      ;
moment when the solution                    completed, progressive altera
tions appear to be produced             in isthe body which    dissolved
                                                                       is          :
                                                                                thus

               the characteristic     Properties   of Tannin.            103
thus turpentine is almost immediately converted into resin,
then into the third variety of the tanning substance, and
lastly into coal.
    Without being under the necessity of adducing other                  ex
amples, we may therefore state sulphuric acid to be a solvent
of the resinous substances, but which continues afterwards
to act on their principles so as to decompose them, coal
being the ultimate product.
    Nitric acid,   as  I have shown in the course of these papers,
and likewise on some former occasions, dissolves the resins,
but the progress       of  its effects seems to be conversely that        of
sulphuric acid ; in the latter case, solution precedes decom
position ; but when nitric acid is employed, decomposition
to a certain degree precedes solution ; for it at first converts
the resins into       a pale    orange-coloured brittle porous sub
stance, then into a product which apparently possesses the
intermediate characters of vegetable extractive matter and of
resin ; and lastly, this is converted into the first variety of
the tanning substance, beyond which I have not been able
to effect any change.
    As coal, therefore,        appears. to be the ultimate effect pro
duced by sulphuric         acid upon the resinous bodies, so does
the first variety of the tanning substance seem to be the ter
minating product afforded by the same when acted upon by
nitric acid.      This effect of nitric acid has been already amply
discussed, neither does it appear necessary that I should here
repeat the remarks which have been made on some of the
simultaneous       products,     such   as  the  vegetable     acids; but,
amongst       the  effects    produced by sulphuric          acid, the coal
which     is formed seems to merit some attention.
                                    § VII.
    After    the tanning      substance    and the other products had
 been obtained from           the resins, balsams,       &c. which have
 been mentioned in the beginning of this paper,                 the follow
ing proportions of coal remained * :
   • The weight of the coal obtained from   each of the above-mentioned sub
stances  was estimated after the complete separation of everr other product,
 and ^fter the moisture had been expelled by red heat in close vessels.

    The      coal  obtained from the resinous bodies by means of
sulphuric acid, is in a much greater proportion than when
equal quantities of those substances are exposed to simple
distillation.
    For, (as      I  have   stated  in my first paper,) 100 grains of
common resin by the humid process afforded 43 of coal,
which after a red heat still weighed 30 grains.
    But     the same quantity      of resin by distillation only yielded
3-4ths of       a grain of coal.
     100 grains     of mastich, by the first method,             afforded    68
 grains of coal.
   * Caoutchouc and elastic bitumen were only superficially carbonized by
the sulphuric acid, so that the proportion of coal above stated is considerably
Jess than that which in reality might have been obtained from thorn.
                                                                   100 grains

             the characteristic Properties      of Tannin.          105
    100 grains     of   the  same mastich only gave 4£ grains of
coal when simply         distilled,
   And 100 grains of amber, when treated with sulphuric
acid, yielded 56 grains of coal.
   But from 100 grains of the same amber, when distilled,
only 3-J- grains could be obtained.
    Many other examples might be adduced, but these appear
to be sufficient    : and I must here observe, that the case is
very   different  in   respect to the gums ; for the difference be
tween the proportions of coal obtained from them by the
humid and dry ways is not very considerable, although it is
always the greatest in the former process when conducted
with precaution.          Moreover it is to be remarked, that, in
either process, variations in the quantity of coal are pro
duced by difference of temperature, by the figure and size of
the vessels, and many other circumstances.
    But it is not only in the proportion that there is so great
a  difference between the coal obtained from the resinous sub
stances by the humid way or by fire, for the quality is also
most commonly different; and this not only applies to re
sins, but also to ligneous matter.
    The coal obtained by the humid process from many of
the resins was shining, hard, and occasionally iridescent.
Few of the coals obtained from the same bodies by fire, had
any of these properties. The combustion of the former was
slow, in the manner of some of the mineral coals ; whilst,
on the contrary, the latter were speedily consumed, like
charcoal.      This difference I was at first inclined to attribute
to a small portion of the acid which might not have been
completely separated, and I therefore purposely made some
experiments, which convinced me that this was not the case.
    Having remarked this difference in           the coals afforded   by
the resins,     I was desirous to make some comparative expe
riments on wood, and for this purpose I selected oak.
    1.  On 480 grains of         oak sawdust  I poured two ounces of
sulphuric     acid diluted with      six ounces of water, and placed
 the matrass     on  a  sand-bath,    where it remained from the be
ginning of     last June to the cud of September.          Dunns this
                                                                   time

 106         Experiments       on a Substance   which possesses
 time the sand-bath           had   very seldom been heated;        but the
 vessel was occasionally shaken.
    At the     end   of  the period above mentioned,         six ounces of
boiling     water were added,        and, the whole being poured upon
 a filter was repeatedly washed, and was afterwards dried on
 a sand-bath in a heat not much exceeding 300°.
    The sawdust        appeared    to be reduced    to a granulated coal,
 partly pulverulent,       and    partly clotted  :  the whole weighed
 210 grains.
    105 grains       of this coal     were  put into a platina crucible,
 and were exposed to a red heat under a muffle. At the same
 time, an equal quantity of charcoal, made from the same oak
sawdust, was placed           in another vessel by the side          of the
former.
    The charcoal          was speedily consumed, and left some
brownish      -white    ashes, which, as usual, afforded alkali, with
a trace    of sulphate, which        was probably sulphate of potash.
    On the contrary,          the   coal formed by the humid way
burned without flame, similar              to the   Kilkenny coal, and
others which do not contain              bitumen.      It was very slowly
consumed, like the mineral coals above mentioned, and left
some pale red ashes, which weighed two grains.                       These
did not yield the smallest vestige of alkali, and the only sa
line substance which could be obtained was a very small por
tion of sulphate of potash, which did not amount to more
than    l-5th of      a  grain;   and it is probable that, had the coal
been more copiously           washed, even this small portion of the
neutral salt would not have been obtained.
    2. At the time when the preceding experiment was begun,
I  also put 480 grains       of the oak sawdust into another ma
trass, and, having added four ounces              of common muriatic
acid, the whole was suffered             to remain during       the  period
which     has been mentioned.
    At   the end     of the four months      the remainder      of the acid
was for the greater         part driven off by heat not exceedine;
300".      The sawdust then        had the appearance     of  a brownish-
black mass,        on which about      a pint of boiling distilled water
was poured       ;  the   whole was decanted into a filter, was re
                                                                   peatedly

            the characteristic Properties        of Tannin.        107
peatedly washed, and was afterwards dried Without heat.
The sawdust then appeared, as I have observed, brownish-
black,  and    was   pulverulent.       It burned with some flame,
emitted still   a  slight vegetable odour, and was reduced to
ashes much sooner than the coal formed by sulphuric acid,
but not so speedily as the oak charcoal. The ashes had an
ochraceous appearance, and were almost devoid of any sa
line substance, excepting a very slight trace of muriate of
potash.
   These two experiments therefore prove,
   1st, That «> jd may by sulphuric acid be converted into
a coal which in its properties is very different from charcoal,
although prepared from the same sort of wood ; and that the
coal thus formed by the action of sulphuric acid resembles
by its mode of burning, and by not affording any alkali
when reduced to ashes, those mineral coals which are devoid
of bitumen.
   2dly, That wood may also be converted into a sort of coal
by muriatic acid ; but in this case some of the vegetable cha
racters remain, although, like the former, not any alkali can
be obtained from the ashes.
                               §  VIII.
   Four different solutions have been proposed respecting
that difficult problem in the natural history of minerals, the
origin and formation of coal.
   The first is,   that pit coal is       an earth or stone chiefly of

   But   Mr. Kirwan      very  justly remarks, that the insuffi
ciency of this solution is demonstrated by Kilkenny and
other coals which are devoid of bitumen, and also that the
 quantity of earthy or stony matter in the most bituminous
coals bears no proportion to the weight of them *.
   The second and most prevailing opinion is, that mineral
coal is  of  vegetable origin   ;  that the vegetable bodies have,
 subsequent to their being buried under vast strata of earth,
been mineralized by some unknown process, of which sul

  been formed.
      The third opinion       is that   of Arduino, who conceives coal
 to be entirely of a marine formation, and to have originated
  from the fat and unctuous matter of the numerous tribes of
  animals that inhabit the ocean.
      And the fourth is Mr. Kirwan's opinion, who considers
 coal and bitumen to have been derived from the primordial
 chaotic fluid *.                                            c

      The limits of this       paper    will not permit me to enter into
 the various arguments and facts which have been adduced
 in the support of these different opinions ; but the second,
 or that which regards the vegetable substances as the prin
 cipal origin of coal, seems by much the most probable, be
 cause it is corroborated by the greater number of geological
 as well as by many experimental results. Most of the former
 have, however, been stated in different works, and I shall
 therefore only notice a few of the latter which have occurred
 in the course of my experiments.
      The observations of Dr. Correa            de Serra on the wood           of
 the submarine forest at Sutton, on the coast of Lincoln
 shire, together with many similar accounts which have been
 published in the Philosophical Transactions and other works,
 demonstrate, in the most satisfactory manner, that whether
vegetables are totally or partially buried under the waves or
under the earth, they are not merely by such means con
verted even into the most imperfect sort of coal f.                       Some

    t  In my paper " On the Change of some of the prorimate Principles of
Vegetables into Bitumen" I have quoted the remarks of Bergman, Von Troil,
and others, on the compressed state of the trunks of the trees which have
been    converted into surturbrand,   Bovey coal, and similar substances*    The
same observation has been also     made by Dr. Correa de Scrra respecting the
timber of the submarine forest at Sutton ; and this is the more remarkable, as
the submerged vegctablei at Sutton do not exhibit any appearance of carboni
zation.
    Dr. Correa  says,
                      " In general the trunks,  branches, and roots of the de
cayed trees    were coniiderably  flattened ; which ij a phenomenon     observed

process, therefore, independent of these circumstances must
have taken place, in order that the vegetable substances, such
as  ligneous matter, resin, oil, &c. should become coal aud
bitumen.
    In   a former paper          I   have endeavoured      to show that these
changes are progressive, and, having noticed the perfect state
of the submerged wood                 at Sutton     and other places,      1   next
described       the qualities       of the different kinds of Bovey coal,
which exhibit         a series   of gradual changes from bodies which
retain the vegetable structure and texture, although imper
fectly carbonized, to others in which almost the complete
characters of the common mineral or pit coal are absolutely
established.
     From    the alder leaves in the schistus from               Iceland     I  ob
tained extractive vegetable matter ; and although this was
not afforded by the varieties of Bovey coal, yet these, as
well as the alder leaves, and also a coal like that of Bovey,
found      in Sussex, at Newick Park, (an estate belonging to
sir Elijah Impey,) and also the surturbrand of Iceland^
yielded some resin, which at Bovey is likewise found in
distinct masses, intermixed with the strata                 of coal,   and com
 bined with asphallum, in the proportion of about 41 parts
 of the latter with 55 of resin *.
     Now, exclusive of             the other vegetable characters which
 are so evident       in   many of the varieties of Bovey coal, of the
 Sussex coal, of surturbrand, &c. &c. the presence of resin
 must be regarded as a strong fact ; for this substance has al
 ways been attributed to the organized bodies, particularly to
 those of the vegetable kingdom, and I do not know of any
 instance, previous to my own experiments, in which resin
 had been discovered as constituting                 part of any of the dif
 ferent species and varieties of coal.
     From     the external        vegetable      characters possessed      by the
 Bovey coal, the           Sussex      coal,    the surturbrand,      and    many

      1 IO      Experiments on a Substance which possesses
     others, together with the resin, (allowed to be exclusively a
     vegetable substance, or at least one which only appertains
     to the organized natural bodies,) there cannot be any doubt
     that such coals have been formed from wood and other sub
     stances belonging to the vegetable       kingdom.
         But some mineralogists attempt to draw a line of separa
     tion between the coals above mentioned and the others,
     which therefore they call the true mineral coals.
        This opinion may in some degree be refuted even           from
    the specimens afforded by the Bovey coal pits, where, as I
    have observed, a regular gradation may be seen from wood
    which is but very imperfectly carbonized, to the substance
    called stone coal, which in every respect appears to be most
    nearly   if not absolutely similar    to the common pit coals *.
        It may   however  be objected, that such a transition is pe
    culiar to this and similar places, and that the pit coal found
    in other situations where nothing resembling the Bovey coal
    can be discovered is in reality of a different nature.
        But this objection, I think, may be answered by the re
   sults   of those experiments on pit coal, Cannel coal, and as-
    phaltum, which I have related in the thifd section of this
   paper ; for, when these were subjected to the action of nitric
   acic not too long continued, it was found that the acid first
•  dissolved the principal part of the carbonaceous matter, and
   if then the process was stopped, there remained a substance
   in   a proportion corresponding to that of the bitumen either
   in pit coal, or principally forming the Cannel coal and as-
  phaltum, which, although not absolutely in the state of
  resin, was however in        a state    intermediate between it and
  the extractive matter.
       Moreover I have stated, that, under similar circumstances,
  a substance possessing in a great measure the same properr
  ties, may be obtained by the known vegetable resins by the
  action of nitric acid.
       When, therefore, these facts are added to that of the na
  tural mixture of resin and asphaltum which is found with
  the Bovey coal, we to all appearance have almost positive
  proof that the pit coals are of vegetable origin.

             the characteristic Properties     of Tannin.        I\\
   True it is, indeed,    that bitumen has never        been formed,
by any artificial process hitherto devised, from the resins or
other vegetable substances. I have myself attempted it in
various ways without success ; for although I occasionally
obtained products which resembled it somewhat in odour
when burned, and other properties, yet the effects of alcohol
or water always proved these products not to be bitumen.
   But synthesis of natural products, although required in
strict chemical demonstration, is (as we have hut too often
occasion    to know) seldom to be attained, especially when
operations are performed on bodies whose component parts
are liable to an infinite    series  of variations in their propor
tions, qualities, and mode of combination.
   Considering, therefore, that bitumen and resin afford, Uy
certain operations, similar products ; that resin and bitumen
are found blended     together by nature ; and that this mixed
substance accompanies a species of coal which in many parts
still exhibits its vegetable origin, whilst in others it passes
into pit coal, we may with the greatest probability conclude
that bitumen is a modification of the resinous and oily parts
of vegetables, produced by some process of nature, which
has operated    by slow and gradual means on immense masses,
so that,    even  if we were acquainted with the process, we
should scarcely be able to imitate its effects, from the want
of time, and deficiency in the bulk of materials.
   But although bitumen cannot at present be artificially
formed from the resinous and other vegetable substances by
any of the known chemical processes, yet there is every
reason   to believe that the agent      employed by nature in the
formation of coal and bitumen           has been either muriatic or
sulphuric acid ; and wheq it is considered that common salt
is never found in coal mines except when in the vicinity of
salt springs, whilst on the contrary, pyrites, sulphate of irdti,
and alum, most commonly are present *; these facts, toge
ther with the sulphureous odour emitted by most of the
mineral    coals when burned, appear strongly to evince the
agency of the latter. That this has been the case, seems

 113        Experiments       on a Substance     which possesses
also to be corroborated by the great resemblance which (a*
has been previously stated) the coals formed artificially from
many vegetable substances bear to the mineral coals, espe
cially   as the similarity     is not confined to external         characters,
but extends to other properties.
    By the action of sulphuric acid              on vegetable bodies, a
much greater portion of their carbon is converted into coal
than when the same are subjected to the effects of fire.
    Several examples respecting the resins have been men
tioned in the seventh section of this paper ; and the result
of   the   experiment made          upon oak perfectly accords with
them.
    M.    Proust, in the course          of some     comparative experi
ments on the proportions of charcoal afforded by different
kinds of wood, obtained 20 per cent, from green oak, and
 J9 per cent from heart of oak *.
    But   by sulphuric acid,       from 480 grains of oak I obtained
210 grains, or about 45 per cent, of coal, which burned not
like the charcoal obtained from the same wood, but like
many of the mineral coals ; and this was also observed in
the combustion of the greater part of the coals obtained, by
the humid way, from resinous substances.
    The experiment on oak, also, appears to refute another
objection to the vegetable origin of pit coal, namely, the
total absence of the alkalis, which, on the contrary, are so
constantly obtained from the ligneous parts of vegetables by
combustion f. But I have shown, that when these bodies
are carbonized in the humid way either by muriatic or by
sulphuric      acid, not any alkali can be obtained from the
ashes    of coals   so formed ; and this seems also to be a further
proof that the humid way has been employed in the opera
tions of nature to convert the above-mentioned substances
into pit coal    ;   for, supposing fire to have been the agent, it
does not appear easy to conceive how the alkali could have
been destroyed or separated J.

       Every circumstance seemB, therefore, to support the opi
  nion of those who consider the pit coals as having been
  formed, in the humid way, principally from vegetable bo
  dies, and most probably by the agency of sulphuric acid ;
  and allowing that animal substances may also have contri
  buted to the production of coal, yet this would not militate
  against the above.mentioned opinion, as the effects produced
  upon them by that acid would in all the essential                     points be
  perfectly similar*.
                                                                                An
 have been formed) were previously deprived of alkali by simple lixiviation
 during their immersion in water. But in page 127 of this paper I have shown
 that the submerged oak of Sutton, although deprived of its tannin, still re
 tained its potash, which certainly would not have been the case if the latter,
 like  the former, could have been separated from the wood by mere solution.
 When wood is reduced to ashes the alkali becomes completely denuded by the
 destruction of the woody fibre, and consequently may be immediately taken
 up by water;      but when wood is converted       into coal in the humid way by
 means    of  an acid, then it seems to me that two effects take place;  for the in
 timate combination of the alkali with the woody 6bre becomes in a great mea
 sure destroyed by the carbonization of the latter, whilst a simultaneous action
arises in the affinity between the acid and the alkali ; so that if coal has been
formed by such means, the alkali must have been separated from the wood in
the state of a dissolved neutral salt.
     *
        From the nature of the experiments which have been related in this
paper, I have unavoidably been induced to notice concisely the different opi
nions on the formation of coal by the humid way; but I did not intend to
 have mentioned any of those which have been brought forward in favour of
the immediate or indirect action of fire, as f only wished to express my senti
ments respecting the most probable of the former opinions.
    Since, however, this paper was written, and partly read before the Royal
Society,     I have  been   favoured by sir James Hall with a copy of his paper,
entitled    "  Account   of a Series of Experiments showing the Effects of Com
pression in modifying the Action of Heat;" and 1 am fully of opinion that
the scientific world has not for a long tinu; received any communication
of more importance,        or in which more accuracy, ability, and perseverance
have been displayed.        The effects which sir James Hall has produced on car
bonate of lime by heat acting under compression, certainly remove a great,
and at one time apparently insurmountable, obstacle to the Huttonian or Plu
tonian theory; and if they do not solve the grand geological problem, they
must, even in an insulated point of view, be allowed to have opened a new
and unexplored field of research in chemistry as well as in geology.
    In the eighth section of this valuable paper the author has given an account
of   some experiments made on leather, horn, and fir sawdust, from which he
obtained coal which        burned with flame, and which apparently resembled
some     of the mineral coals. In one case, also, he obtained a substance which

  114          On the characteristic Properties            of Tannin.
      An inquiry into        the nature and formation          of coal was my
  first object when I discovered the artificial tanning sub
  stance, and, considering the importance of the latter, it
  will not appear surprising that it should immediately have
  engaged     the principal part        of my attention.
      In addition to      the experiments which have been related in
  the three papers upon this subject, I intended to have de
  composed the different varieties, to have compared their gases
  and other products with those of the natural substance called
  tannin,     and especially to have endeavoured              to discover more
  economical methods of obtaining the artificial product ; for,
  exclusive of speculative science, this appears to be an object
  of consequence, not only respecting that useful and valuable
  branch of manufacture to which it immediately relates, but
  also as the means of preventing, or at least of diminishing,
  the premature destruction of timber in a country, where, on
v account of its population, as well as on account of its ma
  ritime position, every oeconomy in such an article should be
  most rigidly observed.
      But, for    the present,      I intend to relinquish this subject to
  such as may consider it worthy of attention ; whilst, as I
  have already stated, [ entertain very sanguine expectations
  that eventually it will prove ceconomically useful ; and should
  any be inclined to pursue the inquiry, I would recommend
  particular attention to those processes which relate to the
  roasted vegetable        substances,      and to peat.
      Almost any refuse vegetable matter, such                  as twigs, dead
  leaves, &c. will serve for the former; whilst                 the latter, as I
  have shown,         does    not require to be roasted, and in many,
  especially the northern counties, peat is found in such abun-
  in external characters appeared somewhat similar to the mixture of uphaltum
  and resin found at Bovey, to which I have given the name of Resin-asphaU
  turn. These experiments sir James Hall intends to resume, and it is my earnest
  wish that he would do so ; for although I am strongly inclined to believe that
  the mineral coals have generally, if not always, been formed by some humid
  process, yet it is impossible to foresee the results which may be obtained from
  animal and vegetable bodies subjected to the effects of heat modified by com
  pression, as the principles of these bodies may be acted upon, and may be
  made to re-act on each other, under cirenmstances which until now have not
  been imagined.

    Before       I conclude this      paper    I shall     also observe,    that the
experiments which have been described must be regarded
only as a mere sketch of that which may be performed ;
whilst the facts which have been ascertained respecting the
resins, balsams, gum resins, and gums, serve to prove that
much may be expected from regnlar chemical examinations
of these bodies. But such investigations, in order that sci
ence may truly be promoted, should be strictly regular                         :   that
is,                        up in

confessedly very imperfect, am persuaded, that, like others

of the sciences, chemistry will be less liable to error when
guided      by   comparative experiments and comparative analyses.

succeeded so far as to help any other person to do more jus
tice lo the subject, my end will be fully gained.
     Observation I. When a thunder storm is gathering, small
specks of cloud may be observed, which increase rapidly in
size ; and round about, in every clear part of the sky, others
may be seen forming, which all keep uniting till a very large
cloud is formed,       which  is shown    by the event to be well
charged with electricity ; for sparks are soon after discharged
to the earth, the cloud collapses, drops of water are formed
by the approach and union of the moist particles, and a
 heavy shower of rain falls from the cloud.           But as it is well
 known that       bodies charged with    electricity never part with
 the whole      at  one shock,    so only a portion       of the cloud
is thus thrown down, proportioned          to the quantity of elec
 tricity previously given    off.   Other  clouds   still keep joining
 the large one, another spark is emitted, and a second torrent
 of rain follows.
     II. In fine weather, when      the wind was      easterly,   I have
 observed   an effect quite the reverse   of  the   foregoing, — large
 clouds coming before the wind from about two miles di
 stance, which were constantly breaking in pieces and dis
 solving in the air, so as to disappear entirely before the wind
 could bring them over my head. I have also been under
 clouds that were       thus  gradually dissolved without being
 followed by any thing like rain ; and when the clouds touch
 the mountains I have seen them break and dissolve quickest.
     III. When this kind of weather had continued some days,
  and all clouds had disappeared,     the sky was verv pale,      owing
  to a mist in the air, which so obscured the distant moun
  tains that little more than their outlinecould be distinguished.
 This proves that the air does not hold the water of the dissi
  pated clouds, or the vapours raised simply by heat, in solu
  tion ; for if so it would be perfectly transparent.         (It is well
  known   by astronomers, that in frosty weather the air is clear
  est ; which is   owing to the complete absence of all vapours
  raised by heat    only.) When clouds again appeared, first the
                                                                     sky

 sky round them, and then all over, became quite bright, and
distant objects more distinct.
    IV. From       this time the same wind lasted            about a fort
night.       On   the  first evening I        observed  that no dew fell    ;
on the second I perceived           a  little ; on the third more; which
increased     every evening      till at length it became so    thick, that
as soon as the sun        was set it obscured the ground ; and the
following mornings          were very foggy.           During these four
teen days the sky became             daily    more  misty, as in Observa
tion    III.    From this    I inferred, that the sun during the day
raised a greater quantity        of vapour than the quantity of elec
tricity    present in the atmosphere could support in the night
and raise up to the clouds ; the electricity having been gra
dually taken up from the earth to form clouds during the
preceding fine weather; and being thus carried away, in the
end     there   was so little left, that a considerable part of the
vapour raised in the day fell down in the night, and continued
till the succeeding sun raised them again.
    From these observations I draw the following inferences:
    1st, That no cloud can be formed, or exist, without elec
tricity.
    2d, That no cloud can rain till it parts with some of its
electricity.
    3d, That in fine weather the earth must be giving elec
tricity to the atmosphere by means of vapour, and in stormy
weather the atmosphere must be giving electricity to the
earth by means of vapour, rain, or lightning.
    4th, That in fine weather            the clouds are separating,    and
in stormy weather uniting.
    5th, That electricity is the suspending power in clouds".
    6th, That dry air is a conductor of heat, but a non-con
ductor of electricity.
    7th, That water can exist permanently in four states, and
temporarily in one. Two of these are effected by electricity,
and three without it. The first electrical state is that of
 cloud,     which   is so much charged as to become lighter than
 air at the surface of the earth ; the second is a complete sa
turation     of  water  with, or solution of         water in, the electric
flui'd,   which    produces    a  transparent and elastic fluid light

enough to float above the highest clouds.           The first of the
three other states is ice ; the second is liquid ; the third, which
is quite temporary, is vapour ; for, as soon as the supply of
heat by which it is raised                      from the earth              is withdrawn,               it
condenses, and returns again to the state of water.
   When the sun raises vapour and there is no electricity in
it, as soon as he sets the water begins to fall down in dew :
if there   is   a    little electric fluid with              it,    falls very slowly,
                                                                   it                                  in
the form of fog         :   if      there   is   more,      it   remains pendent in the
air    little above                the earth, and cannot fall                         if   there
                                                                                                     is

highly charged,                    will   take the highest station                :   and      a     still
larger quantity of electricity be present,  will be dissolved           it
 by the redundant electricity, and form aqueous atmosphere,
as in Observation II.    If this opinion be well founded,                                              it
will follow that the atmosphere composed of air at the sur
                                                       is

partly     of water highly                  rarefied        by   electricity.          It     is     well
known       that       bodies        charged         with    the same electricity repel
each other       ;    and therefore         I    infer that each particle of water
has an atmosphere                  of electricity round             it,
                                                                which totally pre
vents its touching any other particle, and thus renders any
assemblage of them light enough to float    such an elevated             in
part of the atmosphere. This agrees with Observation I.,
and seems, in some measure, proved       it; for how other          by
wise can   be accounted for, that out of
                it                        transparent atmo              a
sphere such immense clouds should be formed as those                                            which »

  Each particle of water that rises from the earth to form                                               a

vation in consequence of that charge of electricity which at
first repelled         it    from         the    earth       remaining undiminished                      ;
which      renders         it      light enough          to float in the air.   If this
charge     is   moderate,            it   forms cloud        ;   if   it    is   strong,    it      forms
a portion of the atmosphere, and attains   suitable elevation.          a
From this may be inferred the cause of the rise and fall of

each other, and, with the temporary help              of   the sun, rapidly
increasing the quantity of the clouds and enlarging the bulk
of the aqueous part of the atmosphere. Though this in
crease of the atmosphere, by the combination of electricity
and water, can make but little    difference in the whole, yet
as   long   it operates the atmosphere must be getting higher
            as
in that place, and at any rate more dense, and so must press
more heavily on the surface of the earth than under different
circumstancesi — hence the rise of the barometer.       When
it rises rapidly, the evaporation by means of electricity may
be inferred to be going on very fast.
   Agreeably to this, after long-continued hot weather, people
in general expect lightning; but this would not follow if
there were not an extra   quantity in the air. This expecta
tion is founded on experience, but a natural cause may be
assigned for the effect; for, when no discharge of electricity
has been effected by the descent  of rain for a long time, the
accumulation by the constant daily ascent of vapour, loaded
with electricity, must at last become so great in the upper
regions that an effort of nature to restore the equilibrium
may with certainty be expected to follow.      When a change
in   the direction   of    the   wind
                                 brings an atmosphere from a
place where the sun has raised more vapour than there is
electricity to support, the air will become damp enough to
form    a   slow conductor       ;   then    the barometer   will begin to
sink, and stormy weather will follow ; for the clouds, being
thus robbed of a portion of their electricity, will condense,
and fall into the lowest station where the atmosphere ba
lances them, which is generally about the height of a thou
sand feet.   The reason why they do not fall lower        thai         is,
at this degree of descent the particles are sufficiently con
densed to unite and form rain, which then falls to the
ground, so that we continue to see only the pun of the
cloud that still remains uncondensed.   But this  not the         is
only cause that  prevents them from descending lower  for               ;
sometimes this fall of rain from the clouds does not yet take
place, owing to the highly electrified vapour beginning to
give otf to the clouds as large   supply as can be carried off
                                         a
by   so imperfect    a    conductor.         The vapour    then   descends
                                     H   4                                   into

 into  a lower region, where it loses its transparency and pre
 sents the appearance       of a general mist, covering the sky, and
 forming itself into small clouds, which keep augmenting
  and joining     the larger clouds in the lowest station, till suffi
 ciently increased to allow the electricity to strike to the di
 stance of the earth ; when it begins to lighten, and the cloud
 is precipitated in rain.         But so sudden a condensation and
 discharge must be accompanied with the formation of an
 extensive vacuum, and an instantaneous collapsing of the sur
 rounding atmosphere ; a cause perfectly sufficient to account
 for the noise of the accompanying          thunder  ; for,  if the dis
 charge of     a large   gun merely by the impulse     of the    gas ge
 nerated   by the explosion of the gunpowder, striking against
 the atmosphere into which it is thrown, can produce so loud
 a report, what proportion can so diminutive an effort be
 made to bear with the large scale on which Nature performs
 her processes?
    The fall of     so large a mass    of water as  was before sus
 pended in the atmosphere must, undeniably, leave its gravity
minus the weight of that mass. Accordingly the barometer
 sinks immediately, and sinks even to a lower station than it
 can maintain ; which          shows, that though the atmosphere
 collapsed    to   destroy   the vacuum where the discharge took
 place, still there is a want of atmosphere in that region, which
is gradually supplied from the neighbourhood, — (one of the
 causes  of winds.)       As the    cause of diminution     of volume
in   the  atmosphere ceases,       the barometer rises   again ; and
when it has entirely ceased to operate, the barometer reaches
 some intermediate point between its highest and lowest
level.                                                            )
    That electricity    is the principal suspending cause   of clouds,
may be inferred from another circumstance.              Clouds exist
permanent in regions of so low a temperature that water
could never reach them without being frozen ; or, if we sup
pose a loss    of  heat to have taken place after the ascent      of the
vapour, how comes it then to be suspended, instead of de
scending in snow ? This shows that there is a great diffe
rence between cloud and vapour : the former being held in
ks divided    state by electricity may perhaps be denominated
                                                            electrified

electrified vapour ; the latter being so held by caloric only
might be called calorified vapour — in speaking of the differ
ence between clouds properly                  so called, and those         exhala
tions which          return to the earth in the form            of dew.
   It will follow           as a consequence from what has been ad
vanced, that when     cloud by any means loses its electricity
                              a
in an atmosphere below the freezing point, then snow
will be produced ; for the vapours will be frozen in the act
of uniting      :    and for a similar reason it           will follow, that     par
ticles   of moisture united into rain, and passing through                   a   cold
region in their descent to the tarth, will come down in the
form of hail.
   The influence which I ascribe to electricity in the produc
tion of all the phenomena before recited, agrees also per-
fectlv wldi the vteil known fact, that rains are more abun
dant and frequent in mountainous than in flat countries.
Indeed, if the remarks I have presumed to offer are correct,
thi? becomes so self-evident that more need not be added                          on-
the subject.

     The commissioners charged by the^society with the exa
 mination of this method proposed by M. Ducom (Messrs.
 Lescan, Thibaut, and Leupold,) have compared it with those
 most practised at sea, and particularly with Douves's method.
This last has been discussed at great length in a memoir by
M. Mendoza, inserted in the Connoissance des Temps for
 1793 ; but the author of this memoir only employs the dif
ferential formulae in the discussion of the errors which might
affect the elements of the calculation, which formulae always
suppose the errors to be extremely small.            Much care and
attention in making the observations, and a sufficient know
ledge of the instruments made use of, reduce the errors in
the altitudes, in the interval marked by the watch and in the
declination,     so as to be effectually very small : bul it is not
the same with errors which affect the latitude by account,
which in certain circumstances may be considerable. As
to the usefid researches of M. Mendoza in his memoir, and
to which we must refer in the cases before cited, the com
missioners      have   added   the  examination    of   the  influence
which    a considerable error in latitude might occasion.
     They have given in their report a formula which expresses
the error of the result given by Douves's method, in powers
of the error which      affects the latitude by account.      In using
this formula it will be necessary      to take so many more terms
of   the series, according as the error in latitude is greater.
     Among other consequences winch this formula presents,
it shows that Douves's method will always give an error
which will be in a contrary sense to that which affects the
latitude by account, and that this error increases rapidly as
the latitude of the place of observation is greater, since the
successive powers of the tangent of the latitude enter into
his method.
     It appears   from the reports made by the above gentle
men that the method proposed by M. Ducom will give the
latitude very exactly, whatever may be the error in the lati
tude by account, when, as the method requires, one of the
two altitudes shall have been taken exactly at the passage by
the prime vertical, or very near it.
     This method     has one inconvenience,     that it is not always
                                                          practicable :

                  of Bourdeaux, far      the Year 1805.                  123
practicable: it cannot be done when the latitude and de
clination are of a contrary denomination ; neither can it
about the equinoxes, because the sun passes the prime ver
tical then in the horizon, or very near it.
    The time when the second altitude is taken, which the
author of the memoir leaves to the observer's pleasure, has
not appeared indifferent to the commissioners with regard to
the greater accuracy of the result : (,hey have engaged to
turn their attention to the examination of the most favoura
ble time for taking the second altitude *.
    When circumstances will permit the proposed method to
be pr,     tistd,  it will be preferable to that of Douves, which,
accoi Jin g to the formula given in the report, for an error at
all considerable in the latitude by account, gives a result
strongly erroneous.
    M.    Leupold     has   been  occupied in a memoir, which he
read to the society,        upon  the generation     of surfaces of       the
second order.        All of them may result from one common
gener    \tion,  which    is executed by a curve of the second kind,
variable in its dimensions, moved in such a manner that its
 plane may always remain parallel to itself.              The -equations
 which point out this circumstance give the law of the mo
 tion of the generatrix. , This curve will be an ellipsis for
 surfaces having a centre, and a parabola for surfaces having
 no eentre.       In the case where each of the points of the ge
 nerating curve has a right line for its direction, the surface
 may be engendered by a straight line, moved in space.                   The
 analy\ical     condition     for this to happen indicates the hy-
 perboloid with only one nappe, the hyperbolic paraboloid,
 and the parabolic cylinder.' The common generatrix to all
 these surfaces      may become       a  circle, except    with regard to
 the hyperbolic        paraboloid   and    the  parabolic cylinder, for

XXI.     On the Mineral Waters         of Lipetzk, in      the Province     of
                       Tambow,       in Russia*.
 JL HE numerous arrivals of the sick           at Lipetzk,     and the ru
mours concerning the efficacy of its mineral waters, at last
induced the Russian government to have their medical pro
perties ascertained   by chemical experiments and analysis.
   The   waters  of Lipetzk   were known in the reign of Peter
the Great.     This monarch, while inspecting                the manufac
tories of that town, was the first who took notice                    of their
healing nature ; they were however, upon the decline of the
manufactures, neglected, and not in any repute till within
the last three years.     Invalids resort to them from all parts
of  the empire, and the arrivals during the last year (1803)
were extremely numerous.
   The town and the fountains are pleasantly situated. In
consequence of the general abundance of provisions in the
province of Tambow all the necessaries of life are extremely
cheap ; and the only difficulty that occurs, is to find lodg
ings and a suitable accommodation.
   According     to the analysis made by a gentleman of the
faculty,   Mr. Skell, commissioned for that purpose by the
college, one pound of the mineral water of Lipetzk con
tains  :
     Carbonate   of iron (ferrum carbonicum) -                  ^f grains.
     Carbonate of lime (terra calcarea carbonica}               -f-j-
     Muriate of magnesia (magnesia muriatica)                   -J-g-

                                                                         send

send   Dr. Albing for      the   purpose of investigating its com
ponent parts, and ascertaining in what diseases particularly
it is capable of affording relief.
    From the observations         made,  it  appears that the water   of
Lipetzk     has some    analogy to that      of Pyrmont   ;  but differs
in having    less of the carbonic acid and sulphate       of lime, and
more    of iron.
    The water of Lipetzk, consequently, in comparison with
that of Pyrmont, has less of the irritating quality, with re
gard to the carbonic acid ; less of the dissolving, with regard
to salts ; and more of the strengthening, with regard to iron.
    Taking into consideration this composition, it may be ge
nerally asserted, that the water of Lipetzk, on one hand, sti
 mulates, gives vigour, increases the elasticity of the muscular
 fibres and the activity of the organs, lessens the poorness of
 blood, and imparts more colour to it ; while on the other it
 liquefies tenacious, slimy, and condensed fluids, remove*
 obstructions in the canals, qualifies the sharpness of hu
 mours,     and destroys    worms.
     Not far from      the   first fountain,   near  the bridge,  is an
 other   of equal extent, possessing the same qualities : it is
 not yet enclosed, but merely defended by a wooden fence
 on one side.
     These waters, like the rest that are known in Europe, are
 used internally and externally.
     The course of taking them in general is from ten to
 twenty days. On the first day one glass U taken, which.
  contains about six ounces of the water: the quantity is in
  creased by one ounce till the number of glasses will amount
  to six. After dinner three glasses are commonly taken, and,
  upon the average estimate of the whole quantity, an invalid
  drinks foflr pounds and a half a day, and sometimes more.
     The diet depends entirely on the judgment of physicians.
  Formerly all sorts of fruits, tea, coffee, and milk, were for
  bidden ; but, with regard to the latter, experience proves the
  restriction to be erroneous : the water diluted with milk has
  been known frequently to increase its effect, and impart
  double vigour to the nerves.
     The best time for the use of them are the months of June,
                                                                   July,

 July,    and August: in autumn and spring, on account of
  the humidity of the atmosphere, they can be of no service.
 A previous preparation is absolutely necessary.
     In slight   diseases,  especially when a previous preparation
 has been made, two or three weeks are commonly sufficient
 for obtaining relief ; but in old and rooted cases, four aad
 six weeks     are required ; and sometimes          it is necessary   to
 repeat the application the ensuing year.
     Morning is by far     the best time   for taking the water; and
 the warmer the weather,          the  earlier   this should be done.
The water      may be used     after breakfast and in the evening ;
but those who take it regularly in the morning, receive more
 relief in three weeks than others in six.
    The measure and quantity taken ought to be proportionate
to the nature and constitution of the patient.               In general,
the stomach should not be overloaded ; and the interval be
tween one glass and another, containing from 12 to 17 table
spoonsful!, should not be less than 15 or 20 minutes.
    At the commencement            ot the course the    following sym
ptoms are observed : head -ache, oppression at the stomach,
loss of appetite, disturbed sleep, &c. according to the dif
ferent constitutions of patients.         These changes, however,
more or less affect every one, on account of the new and
uncommon irritation in the system.              In the course of time
these    symptoms disappear by degrees, and the patient feels
his appetite increase.
    With weak, irritable, ftnd delicate constitutions, such
symptoms happen even some time after, when the quantity
comes to be increased to five, six, or seven glasses a day ;
but in this case the daily allowance is either decreased or
totally laid aside, and then renewed again, according to the
habit of the constitution, when the symptoms disappear.
Some, during the course, are subject to the flux ; in which
case they must leave off till it is stopped.
    In cases of pain and weakness in the stomach, these wa*
ters are particularly efficacious.       In  those diseases which are
incident to the female sex, on account of their tender con--
stitution,   hysterics for example, their effect is excellent.
    A  great many, whose health for several years had been
                                                                assailed

assailed   by chronic and other similar diseases, have found
relief, and sometimes a complete cure, from these waters.
   They    possess also the virtue of counteracting costiveness,
and    dispersing the phlegm accumulating in the stomach ;
their operation is not mechanical, but extends to the very
source and principle      of disease: by        means    of their relaxing
quality, in a slight        degree,    they stimulate        inertness and
weakness, restore       to the organs their former activity,               and
prevent    the   return   of   the   disease.     They     are particularly
useful in cases of worms and hypochondria.
    In those chronical diseases of the breast,             and in declines,
which, although they        do not proceed from ulceration              of  the
lungs, are no less afflicting and fatal, these waters, especially
when they are accompanied with proper nourishing and
strengthening remedies, often give relief, and sometimes
effect a complete cure.
    This salutary    effect  of Lipetzk waters, situated in the very
 heart  of the  populous part of Russia, must considerably in
 crease their value ; more so, as the government                    has taken
upon itself to provide every thing that can make the abode
 of invalids at Lipetzk agreeable and convenient.
    Industry, attracted there by its own interest, facilitates
 the views of the government ; and Lipetzk, famed ior its
 waters, in no distant time will be known all over Europe.
           XXII.    On the Caucasian Mineral Waters".
 JVI-R. SKATELOWITCH, inspector of                  a  medical institution
 in Astracan,     reported     to the; faculty,       in 1797, some ex
 traordinary effects of the cold spring of water discovered in
 some of the Caucasian mountains, 35 versts                 f  from the for
 tress of Constantinohor,        towards     the north-west.       The spring
 is situated in a kind of pit, between two rivers of fresh water,
 issuing from several crevices in the rocks : it foams, throws
 up its sprays in various directions, and then, by a hollow

  channel,    discharges itself into one of the rivers, by which    it
  is surrounded in the form of a semicircle.
      In the year  1 793, Dr. Leventz,  and Mr. Herner,   a chemist,
 were sent by the government to ascertain the nature of the
 above-mentioned spring; and the result proved it to be, in
 reality, possessed of medical virtue.      Professor Pallas, in his
 Travels,    published at Leipzich,    has given a short     account
 of this spring.
     In 1801, Mr. Simpson, a chemist, presented to the col
 lege an account of a warm spring discovered in the chain
 of the Caucasian mountains, five versts north-east from the
 fortress of Constantinohor,       and 40 from     the cold spring.
 It  runs straight towards the west, down        the steep declivity
of    a chalky,   shelly, and curiously-coloured mountain, falls
from the height of 44 yards, divides itself into small rivu
lets, and entirely disappears at the foot of the mountain.
     In  the same year,    in consequence of another report, from
the general     Obriezkow, concerning the Caucasian mineral
waters, the government resolved to send thither some intel
ligent men, for the purpose of describing their situation,
ascertaining their nature, and investigating their virtue and
properties, and transmitting an account thereof; that, if
the result proved favourable, there might be established
proper, secure, and convenient habitations for those who
come to receive the benefit of them.
    In   consequence of this, the next year (1802), in March,
Drs. Hordinsky        and Krushevitch, and Mr. Skwentzon, a che
mist, were sent by the college to the Caucasian mountains.
    Mr. Skwentzon, on his arrival there, endeavoured to find
out the nature of the two springs by a chemical process ;
and, having ascertained the quantity of volatile parts, he
boiled next about 700 pounds of the water, for the purpose
of discovering their solid       and permanent parts, investigated
them minutely, and upon his return produced a comparative
table of the compositions of the Caucasian with other mi
neral waters.
    Meanwhile doctors Hordinsky and Krushevitch spent the
whole summer in the use and application of these waters,
                                                                and

 and in making practical experiments on different individuals
 of both sexes. Having observed their various effects, in va
 rious diseases,      on different constitutions,         they successfully
 acquitted themselves of the task imposed upon them, and
 produced their accounts, from which the following particu
 lars are extracted :
  .  The  temperature      of   the   hot spring, during the warmest
 parts of summer, is, in the evening, from 35 to 37 de
grees,    according to Reaumur's thermometer.                    The quan
tity discharged in three minutes and fifteen seconds is 3580
pounds, and its weight is equal to that of distilled water
brought to the strength of a mineral water. It has a smell
of sulphur,       and  contains the gases of sulphuric and car
bonic acid      :  after the evaporation of 300 pounds, till the
vessel was quite dry,         there remained        12  ounces   7  drachms
and 35 grains       of solid matter.        The water of this spring is
good    for curing eruptions of the skin, intermittent agues,
scorbutic, chronical, and venereal diseases, dropsy, and long
Standing rheumatism.
    The cold spring, according           to the same thermometer, has
at all times 10 degrees of temperature.                 The weight of its
water to that of distilled water is in the proportion of 50 to
30.     It is very transparent, has a sharp acrid taste, and a
smell of carbonic acid, which enters               into its composition:
after the evaporation          of   400 pounds, by boiling, there re
mained 9 ounces and           I-J- drachm of solid matter.           The ef
fect   of this water, whether drunk, or only applied exter
nally, is very beneficial in chronical rheumatisms, in cases
of   general    debility occasioned by venereal excesses, in he
morrhoids,        king's evil, ring-worms, palsy, internal ob
structions,     and   in'all  diseases    where it is necessary to sti
mulate and strengthen the action of the vitals.
    It may be safely affirmed that these waters are equal to
some of the most celebrated            in Europe,     and to some are su
perior.
    As  the warm spring flows from            a great height,     and many
of  the patients cannot, therefore, ascend the steep              declivity;
and as     llie two bathing-       places  at the     top of  the  hill, 6ne
covered      and   the other open, are not sufficient for the ac-

   commodiition    of the  great numbers    of sick,   and there is no
   conveniency to construct additional accommodation ; the
   government resolved to have the water conveyed down, by
  means of pipes, into bathing reservoirs, at the foot of the
  mountain,     formed separately for each of the sexes.
      The cold spring, on account of its low situation,        is often
  inundated in rainy seasons, and choked up wilh mud from the
  adjacent river, which swelling out, in summer time, beyond
  its banks, the bottom was filled with a quantity of chalky
  stones or substances,    which, dissolving in     the carbonic acid
  of   the  wmter, impeded probably its salutary effects.          The
 government, in consequence of this, ordered the fountain to
  be cleared, and the well enclosed with a high wall made             of
 stone, to prevent thereby dirt and common water from run
 ning into it.
     For   the  purpose  of Lathing   there   are to be built several
 covered     and separate baths,  and   also  a covered    gallery for
 the conveniency     of walking in  bad weather.
     Near both these springs are established temporary infir
 maries, under the direction of medical men, and the inspec
 tion of a commissioner, for the preservation of the general
 order and accommodation.
     For the security of visitors there are patrols of Cossacs
stationed along the Caucasian line.
     For the greater benefit of the sick there is an experienced
 physician, with an assistant, whose duty it is to observe the
effects of these waters, and collect all such information, from
actual experience, as may make, in time, a useful and in
structive book, to serve as a guide, both to the patient and
physician, in every thing that concerns these waters.
    The benefit of   these waters is so great, that the govern
ment spares no expenses to bring them into such a state
that they may rival the most celebrated mineral springs of
Europe.

the Caucasian and that      of other mineral   waters in Europe    ;

         tion and Decoction of some Kinds of Cinchona, which
         precipitate neither the Infusion of Tan nor Emetic.
    J.   HESE kinds of cinchona communicate to cold water                               a red
    colour, often     ofyellowish, and sometimes of a brownish
                           a
    cast.   The water thus saturated with the soluble part of these
    cinchonas     becomes  frothy upon agitation, like beer yeasty
    it lias then a bitter taste, with more or less astringeney, ac
    cording to the kind.
      Left to subside in       a   close or open vessel, provided it is not
    full, this cinchona water                becomes          speedily mouldy,      and is
    covered with a greenish pellicle.
         Some of them redden         sensibly turnsole tincture ;
                                             very
    which indicates the presence of a free acid.
      Alcohol mixed with these infusions of cinchona, in the
    proportion of two parts to one, precipitates from it a grayish
    matter, which becomes black upon drying ; the liquor is
    then clearer, and of a purer red : this phenomenon an
    nounces the presence of a mucous matter.
      A small quantity of caustic alkali forms,                          in such   of   these
    waters as are acid, a red precipitate inclining to violet; but
    a greater   quantity of this re-agent redissolvcs the matter,
    and gives   the liquor more intensencss of colour.

    and deposit upon cooling,                 after having been concentrated,
    a very bitter brown substance, which                  is easily dissolved in

    If we     allow the infusions of cinchona to cool several times
before reducing          them to dryness, they deposit upon each
cooling       a   matter similar to that of which we have spoken.
It was formerly thought that this substance became insoluble
on its combination with oxygen ; but this effect seems to be
owing to the insufficiency of the water.
    It   is this resinoiis kind              of       matter which gives to cinchonas
and their infusions                    the bitter taste they possess                ;    for, if we
separate              as they are formed, and afterwards di
                  the deposits
lute the concentrated matter with the same quantity of water,
the liquor has no longer any thing like the same degree of
bitterness.  Nevertheless, the whole of this substance is not
separated from the water by this means ; the other principles
of cinchona always retain                         a    tolerably large quantity of it in
solution.
    But    if,     after having       performed the various operations in
the manner            I    have    described, we treat with alcohol the in
fusions of cinchona                    reduced         into the form          of soft extract,
and separate the greatest part of the resinous-formed                                        matter,
there remains nothing but      viscous substance of
                                                  a                                             brown
colour,       which          has hardly any bitter taste,                     which      is a    com
pletely soluble in water, and does not precipitate on cooling.
   These experiments teach us, that in the infusions of these
kinds of cinchona there are at least two very distinct sub
stances; the one bitter and astringent, soluble       alcohol,                          in
little soluble in water the other, on the contrary, absolutely
                                       ;

colour       and       an extremely bitter taste.                      2.    Cold     water   only
dissolves         a   part   of   it
                                   ;    the rest remains in the form                    of reddish
flakes   ;   but      if     we heat       the mixture            the latter dissolve also,
and we obtain              a   clear liquor of   very deep red, which be

a    few days, and forms    fungus like     solution of gum

     The        aqueous  solution of this substance recently prepared,
and        a    little concentrated, presented the following eiiects
with       the different agents mentioned:                                                 .   '.

there      is   a   grayish white            precipitate formed,             which    is       light

   6. Emetic, or antimoniated tartrite of potash, forms no
precipitate in it. This substance, therefore, is not the same
as  that which precipitates this metallic salt, in the infusions
of certain kinds of cinchona.
    7. Lastly, it reddens very sensibly turnsole tincture.
   The acidity of this suhstance, and the precipitation pro
duced by the alkalis in its concentrated solution,            made   me
suppose that it was indebted for a part of its solubility to
the presence of the free acid which accompanies it: this
seems to me to be founded upon its having been once sepa
rated     by an alkali , - washed and dried, and therefore not
longer soluble in water, except in a very small proportion.
    In order to acquire a greater degree of certainty upon this
substance,      I put some  of it into water acidulated     by different
acids, and      I saw that in fact   it dissolved   with facility, and
that its solutions resumed       a bitter taste, similar to that which
it had before having been precipitated by the alk.nlis.
    I  remarked that this substance         retained, on being preci
pitated,     a portion of the alkali- employed for this purpose ;
at least, the following experiment seems to prove it.              Alter
having precipitated it from its aqueous solution by ammonia,
and washed it in a great quantity of water, 1 mixed with it
some      caustic potash, which        immediately developed an ex
tremely sensible ammoniacal            smell, which it did not pro
duce before having been precipitated by this alkali.
    It  is therefore evident that this substance      is combined   with
a portion      of ammonia, which        serves   to precipitate it from
its solution; at least,     that   the   acid  which accompanies it
 naturally, only forms with this alkali an insoluble salt, and
 mixes with the resinous matter ; which seems very little pro
bable.
     It  would seem,     according to these properties, that this
 substance sometime* performs the part of an acid and some
 times that of an alkali,      since it unites with ihose two kinds
 of   substances    by neutralizing   a part  of their properties.
     If,  after having precipitated this matter by the alkalis,
                                                                      we

we add an   excess of these re-agents, it is redissolved, and
the liquor which  results from it has a reddish brown colour.
   The solubility of this substance in alcohol singularly in
creases on the application of heat.       When this solvent i*
                          it,
saturated        with     it         has   a    reddish brown colour                      and an ex

                        a         fine red colour, slightly in

in an open vessel, crystallizes in needles in the manner of                                              a
salt.
                                                                              it by
     The alcoholic solution, thus precipitated                                        water, retains
a    portion of the matter, which preserves to   pink colour                          a

acid   ;    they change to the yellow so much the more as the
acid     is  more concentrated.    The nitric acid this com                  by
bination loses much                   of   its acidity,   at least the taste seems to
announce this           :   it   is   true that this acid dissolves at the same
time   certain quantity of lime, which the oxalate of am
         a

in neutralizing it.                                        •

   For       a long time        it   has been   known that          the essential    salt
of cinchona       not in fevers an action proportioned to
                        has
that of the quantity of cinchona in powder from which it
has been extracted ; which proves                   that there remains in the
refuse something useful in the cure                     of fevers.
   In my opinion I think that, to                       the   present moment,           a
method has been pursued for the preparation of the essential
salt of cinchona, quite the reverse of the proper process.
When an infusion of cinchona is made, it is evaporated to
a certain degree            cooled, in order to deposit a precipi
                              and
tate   ;    the resinous deposit, which had been formed while
cooling, is then separated : this is repeated until the liquor
is no longer turbid, and has only a pale yellow colour : it is
then dried upon pl-ates placed in ovens.   By performing the
operation in this manner, a very small quantity of resinous
matter only remains in the water, with a gum and a salt with
a base of lime, the efficacy of which in the cure of fevers is
very doubtful.
Comparative             Examination       of    the Resin      of    these Cinchonas
                 with   the other known Vegetable             Substances.
   Does there exist in the vegetable kingdom any immediate
principle to which we may refer the latter ? Should we class
it among          the resins, as hitherto done?                It   is true, that for
merly chemists and apothecaries united together under this
genus so many species of substances, that we might still class
the one in question among them,                    if   we did not narrowly re
flect upon some of its peculiar properties                     ;    but upon apply
ing the name of resin to such substances                       as   truly deserve     it,
those of cinchona              and     of many other          vegetables     ought to
be separated from the resins properly so called.
  If       the    resinous maiter of these cinchonas                  resembles      the
resins      by
           its solubility in alcohol,     different from
                                                  it    is                      it    by
its solubility in water, in the acids, the alkalis, and parti
cularly      by
             its property of precipitating the metallic salts,
and of attaching itself firmly to cloths.      think, therefore,
                                                              I
that we ought to regard this substance as  particular vege     a
table principle, of which chemists have not yet known the
                                                                           properties.

properties.  This principle is not identically the same in all
cinchonas ; it differs in those which precipitate the infusion
of   tan and emetic, and in those which precipitate glue only.
     It    is probable that it is a very analogous principle                       which
most commonly                 gives vegetables their bitter taste.
                  The Properties of Cinchona resumed.
     1.    We    may divide the different species of cinchonas into
three sections, relative to their chemical properties.
     In    the   first we comprise all those which precipitate tan
nin,      and do not precipitate animal gelatine.
     In   the second \ve include the cinchonas which                       precipitate
animal gelatine and do not precipitate tannin.
     In    the third we class            those    which precipitate        at the same
time tannin,         animal gelatine,             and emetic.
     2.    We may conjecture, with                   every appearance        of proba
bility, that      every vegetable             substance   which does not possess
at least one       of the properties              above   indicated will not be a
febrifuge        ; and    it is probable,          also, that the more        of   these
properties is possessed by cinchona and other vegetable                             sub
stances, the more remarkable will their febrifuge properties be.
   3. The property of precipitating tannin not being common
to all the cinchonas,  it is not from that exclusively they de
rive their febrifuge virtue,  since there are several of them
which do not precipitate                 it,
                               and which yet cure fevers.
     4.  would seem, however, that the principle which pre
          It
cipitates the infusion of oak bark and gall-nuts      febri                is
                                                                           a
fuge because in general      acknowledged in medicine that
                                         it
                                         is
       ;
the kinds which produce this effect are best.
   5. On the other hand, the cinchonas which do not preci
pitate the infusion of tan nor gall-nuts being febrifuge,                               it
may be concluded that the principle in virtue of which these
precipitations were formed   not the only one in cinchonas
                                             is
which cures fever.
     6. The principle              which    precipitates the infusion of tan
and gall-nuts,           is   of   a   brown colour and of bitter taste:
                                                                    a                   it
is   less soluble in water than in alcohol                 :   it   also
                                                                    precipitates
emetic, but not glue.                   It   has some    analogies with the re
sinous bodies, although                 it   furnishes ammonia on distillation.
                                                                                   7-   It

142                              Experiments      upon the
      7.   It   seems that it is to the           tannin   of oak bark      and    of
gall-nuts that this principle            joins, in order          to form the pre
cipitates which it occasions in the infusion of these sub-
Stances : nevertheless, this principle existing in some species
of cinchonas which precipitate glue                    at the same time,      it re-
mains doubtful           if it   truly unites to the tannin of the infusion
of oak bark, or that              the principle of the other kinds of cin
chona which precipitate glue is true tannin.
  8. But it must necessarily happen that the one or other                          of
these suppositions is true, since the infusions  of these two
kinds of cinchonas mutually precipitate each other.
   9. The principle which in some kinds of cinchonas pre
cipitates glue, has a bitter and astringent taste : it is more
soluble in water than that which in other kinds precipitates
the infusion of tan : it is alao soluble in alcohol, and does
not precipitate emetic.
  10. It would seem that the substance     which precipitates
infusion of tan is the same which decomposes emetic.
   Thus from all these doubts there remains much.more to
do- before we can exactly ascertain the effective principle or
principles of cinchonas in the cure of fevers.    It is to be
hoped,   that .through time, and in consequence  of assiduous
labour, we shall be able to resolve this important question.

ture and proportions of its principles.     In another place                       I
have explaiued   how  this salt of cinchona may be obtained,
and what processes ought to be employed                       in
                                                order to purify
it:   I    shall therefore now confine myself to              a    simple detail   of
its properties.
      1.   This   salt   is   white;   it   crystallizes     in   square lamina,
                                                                       sometimcd

sometimes rhomboidal,     or with the solid angles truncated :
these laminae are also often united in groups.
  2. It has hardly any taste, and is flexible under the teeth.
  3. It requires about five parts of water, at 10 degrees, in
order to dissolve it.
     4.   It swells, when         heated,       nearly like tartar, of which it
has the smell          ;   it leaves   a   grayish residue, which dissolves in
the acids    with effervescence, and which                             is only a mixture
of   carbonate of lime and charcoal.
    .5.   Its solution does not alter turnsole tincture                         ; and   it is
entirely insoluble in alcohol.
  6. The fixed alkalis, both caustic and carbonated, decom
pose      it,   and precipitate from          it    pure or carbonated lime.
     7.   Ammonia           does not produce the decomposition                       of   it
                                                                                           ;
which proves that this acid has   stronger affinity for lime.

little concentrated, two precipitates, which are in the one
case sulphate of lime, and in the other an oxalate with the
same base.
     9.   It                 alteration in the solution of ace
                causes no apparent
tate of lead, nor in that of nitrate of silver.
     10. Concentrated  sulphuric acid, poured upon this salt
reduced to powder, blackens         slightly  but there are no
                                                   it              ;

   11. What     remarkable
                      is                     is,
                                 that the infusion of tan and
of some kinds of cinchonas, that of Santa-F6 for instance,
produces        a   flaky yellow precipitate in the solution of this salt.
The various            phaenomena          caused         by   these experiments an
nouncing that this salt    formed of   isvegetable acid and    a
lime, in order to decompose     and have the acid isolated

I made use of oxalic acid, which, as we know,     that which               is
renders lime most insoluble                   by    its combination         with it.
 I  proceeded in the following manner: — dissolved, in the         I
necessary quantity of water, 100 parts of this salt; after                       I
wards poured into the liquor, at different timcs, until there
was no more precipitate formed,         solution of oxalic acid,

   This proves that the oxalic acid employed contained about
half its weight of the water of crystallization, and that the
salt of cinchona only contains a small quantity of lime ; he-
cause in 27 parts of oxalate of lime there is more than 1 5
parts of this earth.
   After having thus separated the lime from this salt by the
oxalic acid,             I
                allowed the liquor to evaporate spontaneously
in the air: it was reduced to the form of a very thick syrup,
without giving any sign of crystallization for more than
eight days; but having stirred it with a piece of glass, in order
to extract a part of   which        it,
                                  intended to submit to trial,

I   was astonished to find, some minutes afterwards, that the
liquor      was      crystallized         into   a   hard       mass, formed of         a    great
quantity         of divergent           laminae from several very distinct cen
tres   of crystallization.
     It    was    of   a   slight brown colour  its taste was extremely

acid and         a   little bitter, because the salt of cinchona   em                    I
ployed had not been perfectly purified.
I    shall, however, detail the properties which   recognised                I
in this acid     cannot give long details upon this subject,
                     : I
because     had only
            I         very small quantity of salt of cinchona

at my           command;            1   think, however,            I    examined       it   suffi
ciently to be convinced                    that      it   is   a   peculiar acid hitherto
unknown.
     In its      state       of crystallization       it   has     a   very acid   and      a   bit
terish taste,            as   I   have said above.
     It  perfectly well preserved in the open air and
          is                                                                       ;         it   is
neither deliquescent nor efflorescent.
   Placed upon live coals,       melts very quickly, boils up,
                                             it
becomes black, exhales pungent white vapours, and leaves
but    avery slight charry residue.
     Itforms, with the alkalis and the earths, soluble and cry-
stallizable sajts.
     It   does not precipitate the nitrates                        of silver, mercury, or
lead,      as   most of the other vegetable acids do.
     It   can no longer be doubied that this acid quite new to              is
,us: on reflecting on the specific characters of the other ve
getable acids known, we shall find that not oue of them
unites all Ihe properties of the above.
                                                                                                 In

     In fact, oxalic           acid forms a salt insoluble with lime,                    and,
besides,        decomposes the combination                       of this   earth   with the
acid      of cinchona.
     The citric         and     tartareous            acids also form       an     insoluble
combination with lime, and decompose the acetate of lead.
  The malic acid does not crystallize, and precipitates the
acetate  of lead.
     The benzole             acid    is not very soluble in cold water,                  and
volatilizes without decomposition.
   The gallic acid is also very little soluble in cold water, and
blackens the solution of iron.
     It   has some similarity to the acetous acid by the solubility1
of   its combinations; but the acetous acid does not crystal
lize, and volatilizes without undergoing any alteration.
     I
     shall not mention the camphoric, suberic, and succinic
acids, because they have no analogy with the one in ques
tion.
     We must conclude, therefore, that this acid                              is truly   dif
ferent from all              those       which        are    known;    and we ought to
give the name of kinic acid to                         it,
                                     from the word cinchona,
until we are able to give      better.       it   a
     It to this acid, united with lime, that the physicians of
          is
Lyons, according to M. Deschamps, have attributed the fe
brifuge virtues of cinchona'; they maintain that no inter
mittent fever            can resist          two doses        of this salt, of 36 grains
each.
     If this
           assertion were proved, we could easily conceive how
a    drachm of this suit could cure an intermittent fever, be
causethis quantity represents at least five or six ounces of
common gray cinchona.
 I would not directly deny the result thus announced                                          by
learned         and    respectable           men; but        think myself warranted

in starting           some     doubts on the             subject.  In the first place,
before         it   deserves   implicit confidence,               the experiment ought
to be repeated great number of times, and the success ought
                        a
to be constant; for   often happens that effects are attri
                                    it
buted to medicines, which belong to nature alone.    In me

 difficult to unravel with certitude the causes which                     operate
 to perform an alteration in the state           of  health or disease.
    On the one hand, physicians have learned, by a long ex
 perience, that infusions and extracts of cinchona, prepared
 after the Garaye process, do not produce in any degree, in
 fevers, effects proportioned to the quantities of cinchona
 from which they have been made; and yet these preparations
 contain the salt in question.
    We know      also    that alcoholic       tinctures of cinchona,            in
 which     the salt  of M. Deschamps           does not exist, since it is
insoluble in this menstruum,            nevertheless      cure     intermittent
fevers.
    There are, besides, cinchonas which contain infinitely
small quantities of this salt only ; and there are vegetables
which do not contain it at all, and yet they cure fevers. It is
not without reason, therefore, that I offer my doubts on this
subject; and if it has sometimes happened that this salt has
cured fevers, we may suppose that it was not perfectly freed
from the bitter principle which it forcibly retains.
    To conclude : it is very desirable that physicians should
occupy themselves with ascertaining this question by means
of actual experiments : if results          are obtained similar to those
of the Lyons physicians, it will           be a discovery       of    great im
portance to mankind.
    XXIV.      0« reclaiming Waste iMnds.                 By Mr. JOHN
                             WAGSTAFFB*.
       GENTLEMEN,                                      Norwich, June     27, 1801.
As     your influence for the inclosure of waste laud is con
fessed, and, I conceive, extending within the scope of your
society, and it should now seem on the eve of a parliamen
tary encouragement, I ask leave to recite an experiment I
made on a portion of land of as obvious sterility as perhaps
any present waste within the western counties.
    This was an acclivity which had not been cultivated withia

     memory;         and at the foot        of it  a various tract, gravelly and
    moory,        broken into        hollow     spaces, in which waters rested
    during      the summer months, which waters were covered                      with
    most     of the aquatic plants             native  to stagnant pools.          My
     predecessor        in possession of those watery wastes, during a
     summer drought fed their interstices with sheep, which be
     came diseased, and many of them rotten.
         The mode I pursued was, as much as might be, to extract
     the weeds, roots, and sediment ; lay them in heaps as a pre
    paration of manure measurably to replace and fertilize the
    barren sands and gravel, brought from the heights to fill up
    these hollows. I then opened ditches, raised their sides with
     sand and gravel, and on them planted                  large cuttings of pop-
     Jars and willows.           The ditching         drained the soil, and the
     materials from the heights ratsed this swamp to the proper
    condition       of meadow. The upland I inclosed with thorns
    on     a  willow ley*,        and   within    the banks inlaid      them      with
    seedling trees and forest             ;  divers  of the former have been
    taken down for use, and                 some of the aquatic cuttings are
    grown to       a  timber measure         ; while the several     subdivisions,
    meadow        and upland,       have been cultivated,        and borne every
    species    of grain      and    herbage, confessedly upon an equality
    with     the   long-tillaged circumjacent fields. By a process
    thus pursued, of which I have presumed to adduce this ex
    ample, the numerous millions of waste acres which yet dis-
    fiuure our nation, may, and will become. (he seasons favour
    ing, under your           and    your compatriots' encouragement, a

   fenced       with faster-thriving trees, and more abundant in
   number than the present large tracts of forest produce, pro
    vide for generations yet to come an increase of those neces
   sary timbers        that have given this island an intercourse with
   the inhabitants of every, maritime clime, and an acknow-
 . ledged superiority in the commercial world, which probably
i  it would not have obtained but from the indigenous growth
   of these not sufficiently valued timbers. Although your ex-

   it is \et improving.

fended encouragements have much increased                      them by mul
tiplied plantations,         yet their growth may be indefinitely en
larged by an encouragement for their acorn seed to be placed
in every raised bank, or their seedlings planted in every new-
formed hedge-row ; which most efficaciously might be en
forced by parliament as a conditional obligation on all to
whom they are assigned, under the statute of a national in-
 closure.       But as every seminary of oaks must be referable
 to    a distant posterity, it becomes worthy of every present
 planter in the interior of his hedge-rows to have large cut
 tings of poplar* and willow f, and an intermixture with
 young trees of the resinous tribe. Those I have already
 known may be taken down as timber during the life of the
 planter, and as early as the inlays are grown to afford shelter
 and shade to the herd and the flock that occasionally feed
 within their inclosnres.             I may just add, the fall of the au
 tumnal leaf with the manure of the depasturing cattle may
 continue the fertility of these fields without extraneous aid ;
 and, where not readily procurable, I may further add, that
 in the latter end of the autumn of 1799 I procured turves
 from different wastes, reserved them on a gravel walk, and
 thereon dibbled wheat, almost every grain of which suc
  ceeded, branched into divers stems, which severallv bore a
  full and     perfect   grain^      In  the autumn     of 1SOOJ      I repeated

  ceive, found its way into any systematical arrangement of plants, and in course
  has not received any specific character.     The name assigned it is on the opi
  nion of a gentleman well acquainted with botanic distinction, who conceives
  it to be a variety, perhaps of the two former. 1 may speak from an enlarging
  experience, that it is a handsome and fast growing tree, multiplies itself di
  stinctly from its roots, while its cuttings take with nearly equal facility as the
  two former.

  has already made,    that thev will severally grow to a timber bulk.     The pro-
  jpective diversity of contrasted foliage can perhaps be not better exemplified
  than in the vivid green of the laurel willow and the hoary leaf of the white
  poplar.

 the trial, which at this instant is         as  promising as the other
 proved. The early spring of this year, 1801, I practised the
 same mode with tares, pease, oats, and barley, which se
 verally are promising.         I bring forward these experiments
 to show, that generally every waste may be rendered produc
 tive by the first simple* operation of the plough, and thereby
 supersede the long process pursued by many ; call forth to
 the earliest production the unprofitable wastes of the king
 dom;    and hence, as far as human             foresight can discover,
 prevent such a sensible scarcity as most of our provinces
 have recently felt. And again, under the blessing of Pro
 vidence, witness a competency for ourselves, and a surplus

 XXV.      On the Advantages         of  tha   Use   of Oxen and Neat
        Cattle in Husbandry.          By Lord SOMEBVILLE*.
 -__.   SIR,                                            London.Dec. 8, 1804.
  JL  ou will  have the goodness to express to the Bath Society
 my regret that I cannot attend           its anniversary       meeting, as
•was my intention.
     On the subject of my claim to the premium for a change
 of sheep stock,     See. I have only to observe, that it was made
 at a period tiie most unfavourable to stock, when distress
 for keep of all sorts was greater than 1 have ever known ; and
 that whether the premium be adjudged or not to me, I shall
 ever consider the favourable reception it met from ihc com
 mittee to which it was referred, the able essays which it pro
 duced, and the recommendation which this committee, nu
 merously attended, has unanimously given to this general
 meeting that it should be awarded, together with the proofs
 since produced, as decisive on this important question.

    The return of my year's labour with oxen was made out
for the year 1S03, because, the year 1804 not being expired,
to have made it without the amendment, since resolved on,
would have been a palpable error.                 I now comply with the
repeated and earnest wishes           of the society, in presenting this
statement      for its inspection.
    Unprepared as I was, it would have been impossible to have
done it with that decree          of accuracy which I shall        adhere to
in   any statement of serious import to the public ; but the
rules which govern the proceedings of the Bath Society al
lowing me time to examine my own books, and to obtain
replies to certain needful questions, I have great pleasure in
Stating that the following report is now presented to the so
ciety in substance, I trust, correct. In that part of the state
ment which reduces the hailing and carting of manure to be
equal      to a given      number     of acres ploughed, I have pro
fited by the kind         assistance   of Mr. Paul and Mr. Gordon
Grey.

for, probably amounting to                            Allowing for three-
year-old     steers   ninety     acres,  and   eight half days work of
two two-year-old bulls, worked occasionally with the steers
for the purpose of keeping them quiet ; allowing                      also as
above, the hay harvest, &c. not brought to accounl                  ;  it will
appear that the labour         of  the twelve oxen throughout the year
will amount to, if not exceed, one thousand acres.
    The average amount of our labour is two acres of ley
ground per day, and fallowing and stirring more than two
acres; but the second cross ploughing, or earth, somewhat
less.      Our teams consist of four oxen, a man, and a boy, to
 each    double-furrow       plough, and to each four-wheel wag
 gon.      Our ploughing in general very deep, and our fields
 small, not exceeding 4£ acres each on the average.                     These
 two circumstances are to be duly considered as adding ma
 terially to the labour.         The working stock consists of             six
 teen steers and oxen, two bulls, and three light horses,                  viz.
 six five-year-old oxen, six four-year-old steers, and                     four
 three-year-old ditto.           They are fresh growing stock,              and
 are regularly turned out to graze, after the barley sowing, at
 six years old. The whole object aimed at is to carry on our
 course of crops on the most speedy and vigorous                      system,
 but without injury to the growth of the stock.
     It  is evident that my labour,         severe as it long has been,
  cannot be found to injure the health or growth of the stock:

                  of Oxen and Neat Cattle in Husbandry.
 the exhibition of my oxen annually, within ten months
 grazing from the time they are turned out of work, will
 fully exemplify this important fact.  This was in great part
 my object in establishing the Barbican cattle show ; and, if
 I may be allowed to say so, the effect already produced,
 more especially in countries where oxen were, held in disre
 pute as animals of labour, has exceeded my most sanguine
 expectations. That our crops are worked-in'so expeditiously
 as to amaze those who contend for horse labour only, can
not be denied ; in proof of which, fifty-seven acres of wheat
were this autumn ploughed, sown, and manured in a com
plete manner, according to the usage of the country, within
three weeks, although the weather was unfavourable, and
the land worked close and heavy. The last nine acres were
ploughed, sown, dragged, and harrowed, in one day.     In
obedience to the wishes of the society, I present them with
this statement ; but I wave all claim to a premium.      If,
however, in the ordinary course of business, any man in
this kingdom shall be found to have done more at a less                            ,
cost,       I
        shall consider myself as having trespassed unwor
thily on the notice of this society. It is fitting to add, that
in twenty years labour I have not lost one ox or steer, or
ever broke a yoke or pair by sickness,                 death, or accident.
And I may further add, that so far from incurring any loss
of value from working cattle after their full growth, as is
supposed          to be the       case with
                             horses, amounting to 25 per
cent, or more, my own experience, and the concurring opi
nion of the committee sent to examine our stock in the
month of June last, warrant me in declaring, tlftt working
cattle, from three to six years of age, do actually gain at the
rate of 20 per cent, yearly ; the loss in my own case, in
twenty years, being nothing !
   The premium now in question, baring distinctly waved
my claim to     will probably be awarded to Mr. Billings-
                      it,

a   measure  hitherto untried, namely, to set out his ploughing
by   the acre, and to apply one team of oxen, full grown, with,
                                                                            two

 XXVI.        Practical Statement on the former Subject, with
      Claim of Premium.           By JOHN BILLINGSLEY, Esq.*
  J. HE    claimant states, that his servant Esau Green has on a
 farm of eight hundred acres, the soil of which is of a middling
 texture, ploughed and harrowed, with a team of six oxen
 and a double-furrow          plough, the following acres of land,
 statute-measure,       between the 1st day of January and the
 1st of December, 1804, viz.
     Acres.
       56   of oat stubble.
       63   of turnips for oats.
       68 of ley.
       68   of ley cross-ploughed for        a fallow.
     100    of fallow, for    the purpose of being cleaned             after   a
                slovenly tenant.
       19 of vetches.
       12 of vetches folded off, and sown with wheat,
     385    acres ploughed     in  eleven months.
       56   of oat stubble.
       62   of  turnip sown to oats.
        14   of ley.
       80 of    fallow.
       48 of    cross-ploughed ley.
        19 of   vetches.
        12   of wheat.
      291    acres harrowed     in the   same eleven months.
         • From Letters and Papers of the Bath Agricultural Scatty, voL I.
                                                                            The

    154       Practical Statement         on the  foregoing Subject.
       The claimant further           states,   that no possible error can
   have crept into         this statement.        No other team being em
   ployed     in  the tillage of this farm, and 'the ploughman being
   paid by the acre.          Nor can any doubt arise respecting the
   size  of    the acres,    as  it is well known that lancis newly in
   closed are set out s/a/M/e-mcasure.
      The oxen employed were home-bred, of the long-horned
  race, and were purchased last year of one of the claimant's
   tenants, at the price of 14l. each. Four of them were six
   years old, and four four years old.
      Though eight oxen were kept, six only were worked at a
  time.       The other two were changed as occasion required, at
  the will of the ploughman.                These oxen are in no respect
  injured by their labour, and are now in good working order.
      The ploughman and* driver were paid is. 4d. per acre for
  ploughing, and 6d. per acre for harrowing ; and in this was
 included all accessary attendance on cattle at all times and
  seasons.
            The depth of ploughing from              3 to   5 inches.
            The breadth of ditto             from    7  to 10 inches.
     As   the harrowing was all performed with six oxen, draw
 ing very heavy and long-tined harrows, (provincially called
drags) and in many fields two bouts in a place, it will not
be unfair to estimate two harrowings as ei|ual to one plough
ing;     and     in proof of this comparison it may be observed,
that the double plough will turn two acres and a half in
eight hours, which are half             as  much    as  six oxen can harrow
in the same time.
     Presuming that no solid objection can be brought to the
foregoing statement, it may be satisfactory to the society to
see the    debtor and creditor side of the account, methodically
arranged, so as to ascertain the cost both of the ploughing
and harrowing per acre,            statute-measure.

    If this  had been lett by hire, it would not have been taken
by any neighbouring farmer at less than 8s. per acre plough
ing, and 45. per acre harrowing.
    If the harrowing of two acres be admitted as equal to
ploughing      owe,  it follows that the work done by these oxen,
(caparisoned      in  the old-fashioned way with yokes and bows)
is equal to the ploughing of 530 acres in eleven months, or
578 acres in a year.
    It may naturally         be   supposed,^ that     on so elevated    and
exposed a       hill  as   that of Mendip many interruptions to
tillage work must occur in the course of a year, notwith
standing which the man's earnings (driver included) amount
to 145.     per week nearly ; to which             must be added sundry
work in     the  time of harvest,      (after   his day's work at plough
ing) and other occasional labour, amounting to the average
of 25. per week, constituting altogether the receipt of 135.
per week for himself, and 35. per week for his boy.
    In conducting         this experiment the claimant has sedu
lously guarded his mind against all bias and partiality, being
                                                                   desirous

 156               Notices respecting New Books.
desirous   of getting     at the truth by the most accurate inves
tigation  : and he has no doubt that the statement             of work
performed under the direction of a noble lord (the rival can
didate for this premium) will lead to the same conclusions,
and rescue this most useful animal from that degraded state
6f inferiority in which       he has unjustly been classed.
   At  midsummer last the claimant had not the most distant
idea  of starting     as a   candidate  ; and  since that time he has
in no way whatever stimulated           the ploughman    to extraordi
nary exertion.
   In letting his tillage labour by contract he has not de
parted from the uniform practice of twenty-five years.                A
practice originating       from   an  idea,  that  the best method    of
making servants laborious and honest is to make it their in
terest to be so.
   Encouraging, however,           as  these facts must be to the use
of oxen in this department of husbandry,           he does not venture
to say that they     will answer in all countries, or on     all soils.
   On all light sandy soils, such as Norfolk, Suffolk, &c.
single ploughs of different constructions, drawn by t%vo
horses   without      a driver,    may in cheapness of execution
nearly approach the double-furrow drawn by four oxen.
But on-all level soils unincumbered with stones, and where
good pasture may be found for summer, and good hay for
winter keeping, oxen with the double-plough may in his
opinion be considered as justly entitled to a preference.

OWEDEN       is far from being so well known as it ought to be ;
 the  observations      of intelligent and impartial travellers on
 that country will therefore be read with interest. The small
                                                                  work

work    of M. Eck, from which             we are now about to give some
extracts, is the fruit of       a two months' stay which the author
made in Scania, one             of the finest provinces in Sweden.
M.   Sjaeborg, of Lund, is at present occupied in writing a
statistical, geographical and historical description of it ; and
to his pen we are already indebted for an excellent descrip
tion of     the      province of Blekingia,       published at Lund in
1792 and 1793, in two vo'.s. 8vo.
   There is no country in which persons can travel so expe-
ditiously, or at so little expense, as in Sweden. Although
there are no post horses            similar to those established        in the
other countries of Europe, a royal ordinance regulates the
terms on which the peasants and the inhabitants of the
towns are obliged to let out for hire the necessary horses for
travelling, and the price of this accommodation is extremely
moderate.    Persons travelling may also be accommodated
with a small four-wheeled country carriage ; but it is not at
all convenient, and travellers had much better bring their
own equipage. The horses are small and slender, but they
run with great swiftness ; the roads are good ; the car
riages are often driven by young boys of ten years of age,
and sometimes by young girls ; these children, however,
always drive with great care: according to the last regula
tion, which is dated in 1/65, every traveller has a riuht to
require that they shall drive him a Swedish mile in an hour,
which      is nearly equal      to three leagues.      In    every inn there
is a register, where every traveller may inscribe whether he
has been well or          ill
                     driven, the place to and from which he
travels.        In   the inns in the country,     scarcely    any thing else
than spirits, and some          milk, or   bread and beer,    is   to be found.
M. Eck      therefore advises travellers to bring provisions along
with them.
     Scania  fourteen Swedish miles long and eleven broad.
                is
It contains about 90 square miles, and 219,830 inhabitants,
being   aproportion of 2,442 for every square Swedish mile.
     The climate of Scania,         and   of Blekingia in    its neighbour
hood,      is   milder than the rest        of Sweden.        In spring     the
nightingale visits these countries, and the stork builds her
acst there  which cannot be said of the more northern
                ;                                                           di

   stricts.   Scania resembles Fionia and Seland much,        and the
  same fruits arc cultivated in each province.
      Fishing,   and the rearing   of cattle and bees are consider
  able branches of the industry of the inhabitants of this coun
  try; and the animals here are generally of a stronger make
  than in the rest of Sweden.         Plenty of corn also is culti
  vated here ; which has given it the appellation of the gra
  nary of Sweden.       A great quantity of this corn is sold for
  the supply of the interior of the kingdom.            Hops and to
  bacco are also cultivated in abundance. The higher parts of
  the province furnish a good deal of wood, which would not,
  however, be sufficient for the wants of thu inhabitants, if
  they had not coals also.
      The lovers of mineralogy, and, indeed, travellers of every
, description, will find useful information on that subject in a
  work entitled,    " Guide to the Quarries and Mines of Swe
  den, by Engestrcem ; Stockholm,            1796,   in 8vo."    This
  work has a very fine chart attached to it.
     There are in Scamia     9 cities, 203 parishes, 398 churches,
   153 privileged domains, 13 of which belong to the crown,
  51 large and 89 small domains belonging to nobles, and
  6,42G hemman or peasants'       farms.
     The agriculturists of Scania      are not so active as those  of
  Germany     ; there is even a Swedish proverb on this subject      :
  Han cer liastig som en TiIsk, i. e. He is as active as a German.
  This indolent slowness, particularly that of the domestics,
  often plagues strangers much:
     The peasants of Scania are generally either very rich or very
  poor ; but they do very little to better their condition.      The
  men and women are almost all         of a tall and fine shape, and
'
  of  a healthy complexion.     Among the peasants of this pro
  vince, those are the poorest who cultivate the estates of the
  nobles ; but they are not slaves, as some authors have as
  serted,   for they may quit their masters when they please.
  The immense number of crows with which they are infested
  hinder them from cultivating their lauds so carefully as they
  would otherwise do.         Baron Maklier has driven all the
  crows from his estates, which are very considerable ; he has
  divided them into hemmans or farms, which he lets for a cer
                                                                 tain

this arrangement has been already             felt by the proprietor, and
baron Maklieri's example will soon be imitated by all the
other great proprietors.
   The nobles      and     several   persons of distinction have esta
blished beautiful and useful gardens and orchards, but the
peasants     have  not been able        as yet to    imitate them    ;   every
one is afraid     of being      the first to have a garden,       in  case   of
being robbed by his neighbours who have not similar planta
tions.
   Lund     is a very antient city ;       it was formerly much more
celebrated and important than it is at present.                     M. Eck
gives    some   curious      details   upon    the   history  of   this   city.
                                                                                '
When Charles X. passed through Lund in 1658, the learned
bishop Winstrup solicited his majesty to establish an uni
versity there. The king granted his request ; but it was not
until the reign of Charles XI., his son, that the project was
executed.      The inauguration took            place on the 28th       Janu
ary   1668, being the king's birth-day,           and it was named after
its founder, Academia Carolina Gothorum.                    The   celebrated
Samuel Puffendorf was called there from Heidelberg in order
to teach the law of nature and nations, and contributed not
a little to the splendour        of this new university.
   Some curious         and    satisfactory details upon the state of
the    sciences and learning in these countries at a remote
period will be found              ithe fourth part of the " Konigl.
Vitterhets, Historic och Antiquitau Handlingar."                      Stock

   It   is said that   u   school was established at Lund in 1085.
Notwithstanding         the rarity    of books     at that period, and al
though, in 1317, ten marks of fine silver were paid for n
missal, the cathedral of Lund established a library so early as
 1124. Scania may boast of being the country of the learned
Saxo Grammalicus,           whose real name was Lang, celebrated in
the thirteenth century for the elegance of his Latin style.
   The antient residence of the archbishop is at present the
 seat  of the university.        On the south side there is in a court
an agreeable      promenade, the alleys of which arc formed by
indigenous trees     ;   it is called Lundagord,        and is   much      fre-

qucnted on Sundays by the inhabitants.             To the north of
 the edifice is the botanical garden, which was established in
 1753, in which are a hot- house       and an anatomical      theatre.
 The whole    is surrounded with a very high stone wall.
    Behind the botanical garden are the orchard and plantation
 belonging to the academy, which is called Paradies Lycka;
 containing all sorts of trees, not only indigenous, hut foreign,
 which they endeavour to naturalize in Sweden. This planta
 tion, as well as the Lundagord, is the work of that respect
able old man Eric GustavusLudbeck,         professor of natural his
 tory at Lund, and knight of the order of Wasa, whose house
is in front. From the year 1755 to 1782, 16000 feet of the,
trees  of this plantation have been annually distributed gratis.
    The centre of the college contains the library and the ca
binet of natural history.      The latter has been lately enriohed
by the acquisition of a collection of minerals found in
Russia by M. Norberg, counsellor of the mines at Stock
 holm.     There is here preserved a piece of Descartes's skull,
which    was placed   here by the learned    bishop   of Lund, Cel
sius.    It came into his possession in    the  following manner      :
When the body of this       celebrated   philosopher was about to
be transported from Sweden to Trance, an officer          of the city
guards of Stockholm, thinking to render a signal service to
his country, possessed himself of the skull, and substituted
another which he placed in the coflia. After the officer's
death, the philosopher's skull pa.sscd as an object of curiosity
through the hands of several persons, and was divided ; the
counsellor of state Stiernman, father-in-law         to bishop   Cel
sius, acquired one of these pieces, which the latter gave te
the university of Lund.
    The library possesses a very numerous collection of Greek
and Roman medals, and is particularly rich in works of na
tural history. There is here preserved a very fine manuscript
Virgil, of    the  seventh   or eighth century, upon vellum,
with large initial letters in gold ; a magnificent manuscript
of the Koran; an edition of Julius Caisar in folio, 1469,
with initials in gold ; a Livy of 1470, and similarly executed ;

edition, 1-170, fol. ;  "  Petr. de Crescentiis de Agrkuhura,"

the rubrics and the initial letters are in red, and the charac
ter is Gothic.       This missal      is very rare, and it is asserted
that throughout all Sweden there is only a second copy of
it. There is also the work of count Erich Dalberg, entitled
Suecia Anliqna et Hodierna, published in three volumes in
fol. about 1700, although the year is not mentioned.                This
work, which contains accurate and well executed engravings
of the cities, public buildings, and other curious objects in
the kingdom, was executed at the expenses of Charles XI.
and   XII.
    The library    is disposed    into spacious halls, adorned with
bust*   of professors of    Lund, and several portraits of chancel
lors   of the university,      some    of which     are extremely well
painted.
    The upper part of the academical building contains a ca
binet of natural history and an observatory. The latter is placed
onacircular tower, and at the top of itis a platform surround
ed by an iron balustrade.         This observatory is situated in 55°
4^ 13" latitude, and          30°   57' o" longitude.       It would be
 desirable  if the instruments were better and in greater num
 ber.    From the top of this tower there is a very fine view ;
 the  eye takes in the whole city ; it is surrounded with fine
 meadows and rich corn-fields           ; and in its interior it contains
 a great  number     of gardens,     so that the tout cnsembh resem
 bles a large and fine garden. When the sky is clear, the
 towers of Copenhagen may be easily seen beyond the sea.
 On the first floor there is a large and a small hall, in which
 the academical      sittings arc held     ; and where    the public dis
 courses   are pronounced,       the theses disputed, and where the
 professors    deliver   such   of  their lectures as are public and
 gratuitous.     Nigh this place is the hall in which the senate
 of the  academy assembles,       which is here called the consistory,
  and which is composed of all the professors and of a syndic.
 There are here some good portraits, and among others that
 of Charles XI f.         This heroic prince lived       at Lund in the
 interval between bis return from Pultowa by Stralsund in
  1716, and hii irrwpWon into Norway in the summer of 1718.

 During his stay at Lund, Charles manifested a predilection
  for every thing relating to the sciences. He attended the
  lectures of the professors^ and one day, when he found
  them ali collected in the library, he testified a desire of in
  stantly hearing some public thesis disputed. No person was
  prepared   for such   a  proposition ; Jean Jacques Doebeln,
 however, professor of medicine, pronounced extempore an
 elegant Latin address to the king, and gave this thesis as a
 subject for discussion : Objecta movent senfus, non tarn ra
 tions quanltiatis, quam qualitatis.          Quensel, professor of
 mathematics, undertook to attack him.
     Although this subject is a very abstract one, the king, in
 spite of his vivacity, lent every possible attention to the
 academical disputation he had thus provoked.              As a mark
 of his  esteem for professor Dcebeln,        he conferred upon him
 the dignity   of nobility, and increased his salaries.
    The chemical laboratory, the concert-room appropriated
 to the musical exercises    of  the students, and the hall where
 the public sales of books take place, are in a separate build
 ing in front of the entrance to the cathedral. In another
building there is an armoury, which, in winter,          is made use
of for balls and assemblies.
    The number of students is        150.      Every three years the
faculty of philosophy creates forty masters of arts.         The ex
aminations of this faculty, and of that of jurisprudence, take
place in public, and minutes are drawn up of the questions
and answers.       The faculty of philosophy has three ways of
expressing their opinion upon the degree of talents possessed
by the candidates, and the following are the terms made use
of: 1-audatur, approbatur, admit titur.
    One of the first public functionaries of the state is always
chosen     as chancellor of the university.         The academical
senate names him, and the king confirms the nomination.
The bishop of Scania and Blekingen is always vice-chancel
lor. This university has sixteen professors, thirteen aggreges
or adjuncts, and fourteen masters of arts, who give lectures,
and are called docentes or magistri legentes.           The salaries
of the professors are      paid   in coin,    and they arc tolerably
large ; some of them      are,  besides,   titulars of good livings,
                                                              which

which considerably       increases   their incomes without adding
to their labours, as they are entitled to fulfil their clerical
duties by a chaplain, to whom they allot only a small part
of the emoluments. When a professorship becomes va
cant, the consistory or senatus academicus proposes three
candidates, out of whom the king chooses one.
    There are two printing-houses        at Lund,     that of the uni
versity belongs to    M. Berling.       M.  Anders Lidbeck, son      of
the botanical professor of this university, publishes a weekly
journal entitled " Nytt och Gammal," i. e. " Modern
and    Antient Times."         The short distance between Lund
and Copenhagen enables the learned men of this university
to have a greater facility of communication between Den
mark and       Germany     than their    philosophical     brethren  of
Upsal     and Abo.      Thirty    years ago   a  literary society was
established    under the name of the Physiographical Society ;
it  has published several useful works,         which evince the so
lidity of   the acquirements of its members.
    Professor Retzius possesses a fine, cabinet of natural his
tory ; there is a very fine collection of seeds in it.             The
cabinet of    M. Flormann,      adjunct of the faculty of medicine,
is particularly interesting from the great number of prepa
rations it contains relative to veterinary medicine ; and
 M. Fremling,      professor of speculative philosophy, has a
very fine mincmlogic.il cabinet, plenty of rare medals, and an
                                                  •
extensive library.
    The cathedral is the grandest building in the small city of
Lund ; it is the only remains of its antient splendour. This
 mass «f stones, which seems to have been heaped up by the
 hands of giants, in order to brave eternity, has been from
 the earliest periods regarded as one of the wonders of Swe
 den.     Swenon, king of Denmark, began the building of this
 edifice in 1012; but the time when it was finished is un
 known. It was consecrated in 1145 by archbishop Eskild.
 It  is the largest church in all Sweden, and it is said that it a
 good deal resembles      the cathedral of Spires.      Before the Re
 formation,    there were at least fifty altars in different chapels,
 all richly endowed.        It is of the form of a cross, and, ac*
  cording to vulgar tradition, its two towers represent the two
                                   L3                            female

female    saints   who clung by the feet of our Saviour.                  The
whole edifice is     13.5 ells and a half long*, 50 broad, and 48
ells and three-fourths high. It is built of large hewn stones,
with the exception of the upper part of the towers and some
chapels, which are brick.
   Divine    service is at present performed in the nave,               or the
western part of the church. We there see considerable frag
ments of a large old clock, which indicated the hours,
months, and days, sun-rise and sun-set, &c. The altar is of
white     marble;    the    pulpit is of white and black marble;
both are ornamented with bas-reliefs carefully wrought.
    The choir, or the eastern part of the cathedral, is a little
higher     than the nave,      and is used        in order to celebrate the
academical      promotions, as well as the installation of the
new rector of the university, which takes place on the 28th
of January every year, being St. Charles's day.
    During M. Eck's stay at Lund, the act of promotion of
the masters of arts was celebrated ; it only takes place every
three years, with much solemnity, mingled with many
absurdities.
    In  the choir there is an enormous brass candelabrum, sur
mounted by a small statue of St. Laurence ; there is also a
curious altar of the middle age, adorned with figures in re
lief, which    represent    several subjects       in sacred history. Be
fore this altar there is      a pavement        different from that of the
rest of the church.          It   is said    that   this formerly served as
an asylum for criminals.              Under      the  choir there is a sub
terranean     church called        Krafts Kirka, which was formerly
appropriated for     the   religious assemblies of the German po
pulation.      In this vast vaulted hall we remark the following
objects   :
    1.  Two pillars,     on one      of which there        is sculptured the
figure of a giant,       and on the other those             of his wife and
child. According          to popular       tradition    his name is Finn.
It  is added,   that  it was he who built this church,              at the re
quest of St. Laurence, who              consecrated     it to  the Holy Vir
gin ; that afterwards this giant and his wife wanted to de
molish the church ; but, in order to punish them, they were

introduction of a new religion, afterwards attempted to de

                               requested                   from the chapter
ofthe cathedral for this purpose.
   When king Adolphus Frederick and qneen Louisa Ul
rica visited the cathedral of Lund in 1754, this princess
testified that   would give her pleasure to see published an
                  it
historicaldescription of this remarkable edifice. This in
duced  the learned professor Sommelius to compose       co                    a
pious dissertation upon this churth, which he dedicated to
the queen*, and in which he has given     description of all

   The exterior of the cathedral presents an imposing coup
d'ceil, which results from its great simplicity.        to be           It   is
regretted  that  the houses are too close together, which at

wood.       The most     of them    are  only one story high. This
city has in general       more the    appearance of a large village ;
it  is badly paved,     and in some places the pavement is en
tirely wanting : thus the least rain renders the streets almost
impassable, and most of the professors are obliged to keep
a carriage.      To most of the houses are attached gardens, in
which fine fruit-trees are cultivated. The inhabitants in
general are fond of agricultural pursuits.             The neighbour
hood of the city abounds in fine tobacco plantations, and
within these forty years past the produce has amounted to
 160,000 pounds weight.           In 1730, a coal-pit was opened
near Lund, but some years ago the digging of it ceased.
    From Lund       M. Eck      proceeded    to  Malmoe, one of the
richest    cities in Sweden,       and the commerce        of which is
very flourishing.       The houses are better built than those of
the other cities in Scania; the number of its inhabitants is
8000.      On the king's birth-day,           the order of Knut (or
Canute)      holds  a  solemn    assembly    in   a fine saloon in the
town-hall, which is adorned with several portraits of kings
who were members of this association.                 In antient times
there were several similar orders or associations          ; the latter,
however, is the last that now exists.           It was founded   in ho
nour of Knut      IV., who was massacred by the peasants          in the
eleventh century.        The kings and princes of the kingdom
have always been members of this fraternity.              In its hall of
assembling      two silver  vases  of  an  extraordinary size are pre
served, (out of which the members drink at their annual re
pasts,) and a grand silver pigeon, which is suspended by a
strong silver chain from the neck of the newly admitted
members.        The same fraternity has also a grand bell in the
tower of the cathedral, which is sounded at the death of
every member.        An eulogium      is also pronounced upon those
who merit      the distinction.    Each new member makes choice
of   a sister, to whom     as well as to himself the distinguishing
mark     of  the  order is granted, viz. a small silver pigeon
suspended from the neck by a blue ribbon.               The members,
however, wear it only at their assemblies, and on the
king's birth-day.       A very learned Danish lawyer, professor
Hofod     Ancker,   has  written a work upon this order of Knut.
                                                                  There

   There      are  in the city of Malmoe several manufactories,
among others, one of tobacco, where it is cut by a machine
worked by horses, and a cloth manufactory, which is very
extensive and remarkable ; it is upon the footing of the
English manufactories. Near the city there are fine gardens
and beautiful fields.
    Between Malmoe and Lund, near the road, is seen a large
family tumulus, open towards the north. In the inside there
is a space    of two ells and a half high, three ells broad, and five
long.      To the left of this place there is a small chamber,
four ells long, and about an ell and a. half high.              There was
nothing found except a large irons word, which is at present
preserved      in the cabinet    of the university of Lund, with        se
veral similar antiquities.          Nearer Malmoe there are several
fine tumuli, but they have not yet been opened.                     Plenty
of them are to be found throughout all Scania and Sceland,
and they have a pleasing effect.
     In the reign of Charles XI. the study of           the antiquities    of
 Sweden occupied much of the public attention ; since that
 period they have been a little neglected.                 M. Tham, in-
tendant of the court, at present devotes himself with a most
 praise-worthy zeal to researches upon the monuments of his
 country ; he has collected several upon his estate in West
 Gothland,       and has published a description          and engravings
 of them in a work, of which he is preparing a continuation ».
     The island of Ilween, situated between the coasts of Swe
 den and those of Denmark, is celebrated in the History of
 Sciences from the circumstance of the Danish king Fre
 derick    II.,  the grand protector     of the sciences, and particu
 larly mathematics and astronomy, having conferred it as a
 fief f   upon the celebrated astronomer Tycho Brahe, by a
 solemn act, dated 1 5th May 1 57 6.
     On   the 8th    of August, in the same year, the first founda
 tions were laid of the magnificent observatory of LJranien-
 borg, and on the 14th of December following Tycho Brahe

 made the first astronomical observations in this island.        In
 the library of the university of Copenhagen are still pre
 served the sheets containing the astronomical observations
 made at Uranienborg from 1576 to 1597-          The retired and
 tranquil situation of this remarkable island     renders   it ex
 tremely favourable to the study of the mathematical sciences.
 Tycho lived for these studies alone ; he there invented
 and   executed  new instruments,    formed some excellent pu
 pils, and, by the care      which he bestowed on the sick
 islanders, (whom he supplied with such medicines as resulted
from his extensive chemical inquiries,)        has deserved the
admiration of all Europe, as much as from his discoveries in
astronomy.
    The greatest scholars, princes and kings, visited this great
man in hits retreat, kept up communications with him, and
profited by his advice. In 1577, the university of Copen
hagen unanimously voted him their chief; but his occupa
tions at Uranienborg did not admit of his accepting of this
testimony of the esteem of his learned countrymen.            King
Frederick    II. did not content himself with granting him
large   appointments   ; he made     him considerable presents,
and conferred on him the order of the Elephant.                The
favours heaped upon Tycho Brahe, in consequence of his
merit attracted some envy ; and, after the death of Frede
rick in 1588, his enemies succeeded in oppressing him more
and more, so that at last they only left him the island of
Ilween,    which  brought him in no more than 200 crowns.
This succession of ill usage drove him from his ungrateful
country, and in the month of June 1597 he set out for
Italy.   After having remained     some time at Rostock, and      in
some    other places, the emperor      Rodolph II.,    that great
amateur and protector of the arts and sciences, invited him
to Prague, and showered upon him the most striking testi
monies of his esteem.        He conversed with him in Latin         ;
made him a present     of 2000 golden florins ; assigned him an
annual pension    of  3000  golden florins; fitted up for him a
house at Prague, and a chateau at Benach, some leagues from
that city, that he might give himself up to his astronomical
and chemical labours ; and finally gave him the promise of a
                                                               fief,

fief, with the reversion to his family, that he might have no
uneasiness on this point.            The emperor studied the works
of Brahe with the greatest zeal, and often consulted with
him on political subjects also. Death, however, prema
turely carried him off in 1601, in the 55th year of his age,
and frustrated the hopes which had been entertained from
the labours to which he had attached himself. In the church
of Prague there is a beautiful monument erected to him,
with an honourable inscription.
     At present there are rery few traces to be found in the
isle of Ilween of the observatory formerly occupied by
Brahe      :  the present inhabitants are occupied entirely in
fishing and agriculture.         Several tumuli of the antient days
of paganism are to be found here.
      Helsingborg,     an antient city, and formerly a considerable
one, has not yet recovered         from the ruinous consequences of
the several sieges which it sustained in the wars between
Denmark and Ssveden ; it has only about 1 200 inhabitants.
 In     summer this city is lively enough, on account of the
 strangers who come to drink the waters of Ramlcesa, situ
 ated half a league beyond        it  ; the proximity    of Copenhagen
 produces a great crowd of the            inhabitants of that city here
 on Sundays and holidays.              M. Eck there met with a good
 company of Swedish comedians, who had established their
 theatre     in  a barn,   and who played several         original  pieces
 and      some   imitations   of Kotzebue,      Iffland,  Schraeder     and
 Yunger,        &c.   Upon this occasion,         M. Eck     says  a     few-
 words upon the dramatic literature of Sweden, which has
 within these few years suffered a sensible loss in consequence
  of    the premature death     of Lidner, author of       a  Medea and
  several other poems, which evince his genius.              There is an
  other Swedish dramatic chef-d'oeuvre by another living au
  thor,     Leopold ; it is entitled Oden eller Asarnes Utwan-
  dring:      " Odes, or Emigration of the Asarnes." M. Adler-
  beth,    a respectable  old man, and counsellor to the chancery,
  has published several dramatic works, which are distinguished
  by a purity and dignity of language.             Kenell, who has been
  dead some years, was the author          of several good pieces    ;   and
  within     these few years,   a  young man, Charles Lindegreen,

 has entered      into the    career    of the drama under favourable
 auspices.      Alien    has given      several translations of foreign
 pieces. It may be said in general that within the latter half
 of the 18th century, and particularly since the reign of Gus-
tavus    III.,   the belles lettres,     and particularly      poetry, have
been cultivated       in  Sweden     with  much success      :  the example
 of this last monarch, who is himself celebrated as a poet and
 an orator*, has had necessarily a most salutary influence
 upon the fate of letters. By establishing the Swedish Aca
 demy, composed of eighteen members, his principal object
 was the cultivation of the Swedish language, and to favour
poetry and eloquence.
    Among the best poets of Sweden now dead, M. Eck
 mentions Nordenflycht, Kellegrcw, Lidner, Creutz, Kexell,
 Bellman, and Oelf ; and among living poets, Adlerbeth and
 Leopold    j  the latter is also author       of several very fine lyrical
 compositions, and        of an  agreeable    collection   of erotic poems.
 Count Gyllenborg, a respectable old nobleman, some years ago
 published amuch esteemed heroic poem, entitled Togetcefver
 Belt;    "  Expedition of Charles X. beyond the Belt;" some
satirical poems, in which he has taken Boileau as his model ;
and several lyrical poems, which will secure him an honour
able place among the best poets of our times f. The mar
shal of the empire, count Oxenstierna, is the author of a
happy imitation of the Georgics of Virgil, entitled Skoe-
iorne, or     " The Harvest."        Francis Franzen has written several
lyrical pieces, in which he has drawn the picture of a coun
try life and simplicity of manners.               Eckeberg is the author
of   several good satires ; and Bagge          % published, at the age of
 1                                                                   eighteen,

was dedicated to Pope Clement XIV., and in the dedication Michelessi calls
Costavus III. eloquentissimum regem.

Reference      to the   Engravings of    Mr. Snodgrass's Method   of
                        Heating Rooms    by Steam.
  The proposed mode of heating rooms will, perhaps, be
most distinctly explained by a brief history of the first ideas
of the memorialist on the subject ; of his attempts to put
them into practice ; and of the successive improvements
which have been suggested to him by experience.
   In April     1798 he was engaged by     G. Macintosh and David
Dale, esqrs. to manage        a   cotton mill near Dornoch, in the
county of Sutherland.             He remained in Glasgow for six
months after this, superintending the construction of ma
chinery for the mill. During this period he was led to con
sider of a cheap method of heating the mill, as he had learnt
that fuel was extremely scarce and dear in the county in
which the mill was situated.  It was evident that none of
the methods which   he had seen practised could be applied
but at an enormous expense; and his experience had pointed
out to him important defects and inconveniences in them
all.  Having observed a mode of drying muslins by wrap
ping them round hollow metal cylinders, filled with steam,
practised at the bleach-fields near Glasgow, it occurred to
him, that, by means of a proper apparatus, steam might be
applied   to heat a cotton    mill, or   any other large   manufac
tory.     It   was evident that this not only would be an ceco-
nomicai    mode of producing heat in large works, so far as
fuel was concerned, but that it would prevent the danger of
fire, to which such works, when heated in the usual manner,
are much exposed.    He communicated his notions to a
number of cotton spinners and others, from whose sugges
tions he expected assistance.        But he met with nothing but
discouragement;         the project being every where treated light
ly, or pronounced to be impracticable.    Strongly impressed,
however, with the advantages of the plan, the memorialist
persevered in his resolution to make trial of       it,
                                                  and ordered
tin pipes to be made for the purpose. These he erected in
the mill      May 1799.
               in          When filled with steam they at
once produced the necessary degree of heat   but the pipes,
                                                  ;
having been damaged in the carriage, proved not sufficiently
                                                            strong.

  1 74            Mode    of Heating  Rooms by
 strong.      Indeed, the memorialist was        immediately sensible
 that their position was unfavourable.         With     a view to some
 conveniences in point of room, they had been carried up
 diagonally in one end of the mill, whence the upper sides
 of the pipes became sooner heated than the lower ; which
 caused     an unequal expansion.        The water arising from      the
 steam condensed       in the pipes in its return to the boiler,    and
also obstructed the steam in its ascent.           In order  to remedy
these defects, the pipes were altered, and erected in a perpen
dicular position, and certain tubes were connected with them
to carry off the water arising from condensation. The whole
apparatus, as it stood after this alteration, is represented by
the drawing, fig. 1 .
     This drawing presents a view of an inner gable, which is
at one extremity       of the preparation    and    spinning-rooms of
the mill.       On the other side of this gable there is a space
of    17  feet, enclosed by an outer gable, and containing the
water-wheel, the staircase, and small rooms for the accom
modation of the work.          In this  space the furnace and boiler
are placed on the ground.         The boiler cannot be shown here,
as it lies behind      the gable exhibited ;    nor is it of any con
sequence, as there is nothing peculiar in it. It may be of
any convenient form.          The feeding apparatus, &c. are in
every respect the same as in the boiler of a common steam-
engine.       A circular  copper boiler, two feet diameter by two
feet deep, containing 30 gallons of water, with a large cop
per head as a reservoir for the steam, was found to answer
in    the   present instance.     The  steam   is conveyed from the
boiler through the gable, by the copper pipe B, into the tin
pipe C, C. From C it passes into the centres of the per
pendicular      pipes   E, E, E, by the small bent copper tubes
D, D, D. The         pipes E, E, E, are connected under the garret
floor by the tubes F, F, for the more easy circulation of the
steam. The middle pipe, E, is carried through the garret
floor, and communicates with a lying pipe, 36 feet in length
(the end of which is seen at G), for heating the garret. At
the further extremity        of the pipe G,   there is a valve falling
inwards to prevent a vacuum being formed on the cooling
of the apparatus ; the consequence of wtiich would be the
                                                              crushing

               Mode of Heating        Rooms by Steam,                  1 75
crushing    of  the pipes    by the pressure       of   the atmosphere.
Similar valves, K, K, are placed .near the top of the perpen
dicular pipes E, E; and from the middle one E, the small
pipe passes through the roof,         and is furnished with      a valve
at  I, opening outwards,       to suffer the air to escape while the
pipes are filling with steam, or the steam itself to escape
when the charge is too high.
    The water condensed in the perpendicular pipes E,E, E,
trickles down their sides into the three funnels            L, L, L,    the
necks   of which may either pass through or round the pipe C,
into the copper tube M, M, which also receives the water
condensed in C,C, by means of the short tubes N, N. The
pipe C, C, \3 itself so much inclined as to cause the Water
to run along it to the tubes N, N, and the pipe G in the
garret has an inclination of 18 inches in its length, to bring
the water condensed in it back to          the"  middle pipe E.       The
tube   M, M,   carries back the water through the gable to the
boiler, which stands       five   feet lower     than this tube.      It is
material to return the water to the boiler, as, being nearly
at a boiling heat, a considerable expense             of fuel is thereby
saved.
    The large pipes are ten inches in diameter, and are made
of the second kind of tinned iron plates. The dimensions
of   the smaller tubes     are seen by their comparative size            in
the drawing,     and perhaps      they might be varied without in
 convenience.
    The  apparatus   erected    as  here   described, has been found
sufficiently strong, and has required no material repairs since
the first alterations were made.          The leading object in the
 instance under consideration being to save fuel, in order to
 derive as much heat as possible from a given quantity of
 fuel, the flue from the furnace, which heats the boiler, is
conveyed into common stone pipes placed in the cable.
These are erected so     as to prevent any danger of fire, in the
manner shown in the drawing, fig. 2. The steam with this
auxiliary communicates a heat of about 70° to the mill, the
 rooms   of which   are 50 feet long,      32-j. feet  wide, and  8^-  feet
 high, except the lower story and garret ; the forme/ of which
 is 11, and the latter 7 feet high.        The rooms warmed in this

manner are much more wholesome and agreeable than those
heated by the best constructed stoves, being perfectly free
from vapour or contaminated air.
   By various experiments it appears that the expense of fuel
is scarcely one-half of what is necessary to produce the same
degree of heat with the best constructed stoves.     The me
morialist was the better able to make the comparison, since
he had previously had five years experience of cotton mills
on what was, at that              time, reckoned the most approved
plan.
     After having        ascertained   these     results, the memorialist,
in    1S00,   drew
                 plan similar to that now presented to the
                     a
society, and sent it to Glasgow to his employers, who were
very doubtful of the success of the scheme.    They imme
diately published the discovery in the Glasgow newspapers,
inviting cotton spinners, and others interested, to inspect
the  plan. In co.isequence of this public intimation of the
method having been successfully practised, a number of
cotton spinners turned their attention to               it,
                                              and adopted                it
with various modifications, according to the convenience of
their mills, or their notions of improvement.
  The memorialist afforded to every person who desired                  it,
all the information on the subject which he possessed. His
general recommendations were to detach the condensed
water, in retuming   to the boiler, as much as possible
                             it
from the steam; and where tin pipes, or others of similar
strength, were       used,     to secure    them carefully with safety
valves.
   There are obvious defects      the application of the prin
                                       in
ciple, as practised in the instance described above. Of some
of    these                     perfectly aware at the time of
              the memorialist was
the first construction of the apparatus, though     was out ofit
his power to remedy them       and he has thought
                                   ;                 proper to it
give    detail of the lirst successful experiment exactly as
         a                                                               it
took plaee.
     From     the pipes being       all in one end of the house, the
heat was unequally diffused, and            a   considerable time elapsed,
after their being first heated, before  reached the other end
                                                 it

the   spinning machinery, it was impossible to erect the pipes
in any other situation, or to convey them along the rooms,
so as to produce a more equal distribution of heat.                  This,
however, can be so easily effected, when there are no ob
stacles, such as have been mentioned, that it is scarcely ne
cessary to enter into any detail of the means.                 It may be
barely mentioned that the memorialist has fitted up the
apparatus in two cotton mills, which are now under his ma
nagement, belonging to George Houston, esq. and Co. of
Johnstone, in a manner which completely distributes the
heat.     In one of these mills, consisting of six stories, a
lying pipe of cast iron, 5 inches in diameter, is carried along
the middle of the lower story, about two feet from the
ceiling, with a small declivity to carry off the water. This
pipe heats the story in which it is placed. Tin pipes, 7£
inches diameter, communicating with this lying pipe, are
carried up perpendicularly through all the floors to the top
of   the house at the distance          of seven feet from each other,
and form a line        of   heated   columns    in the middle of each
room. — The same           general    plan has been followed in the
other mill.       But there are several irregularities in the build
ing, which require         a  little variation of the contrivances for
diffusing    the heat to every quarter.           Some of the rooms
having     been   added since the first erection of the mil!, are
connected with the main body of the building                 awkwardly.
Into these the steam is carried by lying pipes,               slightly in
clined,    and    communicating with the principal apparatus.
The    steam    may afterwards be distributed by oilier pipes in
any way that is thought convenient.               The memorialist has
found    no  difficulty   in  conveying, by such means, the steam
necessary     to produce the degree of          heat  required    in every
variety of situation.
    In  the former     of   the last-mentioned     mills,  the perpendi
cular pipes are connected under the ceiling of the garret by
a pipe   2i inches diameter, slightly inclined, the extremities
 of which pass tin-rush the walls of the house, and are pro
vided with valves opening outwards.                A connecting pipe,
with similar valves, is placed under the ceiling of the third
 story.    These are intended for the more           ea-;y circulation   of

 the steam     : but     the   memorialist found, from experience,
 that with all these aids, the filling of the perpendicular pipes
 with steam was attended with some difficulty.             The steam,
 when first thrown in, passes up the perpendicular pipe
 nearest to the boiler, and, being specifically lighter than air,
 occupies the upper part of the apparatus, compressing the
 air in the lower part of the rest of the pipes. The resist
 ance  of   the   air will thus for    a  long time prevent the pipes
 from being completely heated : but this difficulty is easily
 obviated by having a valve or valves opening outwards, at
 the lowest part of the apparatus, through which the air,
 when compressed by the steam, is suffered to escape.                 In
 the mill just mentioned, the lying cast iron pipe in the first
 story is carried through the gables of the mill, and furnished
 with valves for the egress of the air.           It is unnecessary to
 repeat, that the same valves serve for the discharge of the
 air in heating the apparatus, and of the steam itself, when
its expansive force becomes too great.             In both mills each
 of  the perpendicular        pipes is provided with a valve, to pre
vent   a  vacuum     ; and    in the second mill the lying pipes for
carrying     the steam      into the detached rooms have each two
valves, one opening inwards, and the other outwards.
    Certificates of five other mills being heated in a similar
Planner, by the direction of the memorialist, are presented
to the society.
    The application of the.principle to buildings already con
structed, it is presumed, will be sufficiently obvious from
the foregoing details.            In new manufactories, where the
mode of heating may be made a part of the original plan, a
more convenient apparatus may be introduced. This will be
best explained by a description         of the drawing, fig. 2., which
gives   a  section of      a  cotton-mill constructed in a manner
which     the memorialist        would adopt, were he to apply the
steam apparatus        to a new building,     or any other that would
permit such an apparatus from its regular constructions.             In
an   old mill in this place, an apparatus is now erecting by
the advice -of the memorialist, conformable to this plan,
which is likely to be generally adopted in new cotton mills.

furnace conveys the smoke into the cast iron stove pipes, 1,
S, 3, 4. These pipes are placed in a space in the gable, en
tirely inclosed with brick, except at the small apertures, 5, 6,
7, 8.     A current of air is admitted below                  at 9, and       thrown
into the rooms by those openings, after being heated by con
tact with the pipes.  This part of the plan is adopted with a
view to prevent, as much as possible, any of the heat, pro
duced by the fuel used, from being thrown away. It may be
omitted where any danger of fire is apprehended from it,
and the smoke may be carried                  off in any way that is consi
dered   absolutely       secure.          So far, however, as the memo
rialist is able to judge, there seems to be little or no danger
of fire from a stove of this construction.     The greatest in
convenience of   a common stove is, that the cockle or metal
furnace is liable to crack from the intensity of the heat. By
ihe continuity of the metal from the fire-place, an intense
heat is also conducted along the pipes, which exposes them
to the same                Here the smoke being previously
                      accident.
conveyed through a    brick  flue, can never communicate to
the pipes a degree of heat sufficient to crack them. In like
manner the pipes, having no communication with the rooms
but by the small apertures, cannot come in contact with any
combustible  substance ; and from being surrounded with
air, which is constantly changing, can impart only a very
moderate degree of heat to the walls. The iron supporters of
the pipesmay be imbedded in some substance which is a
bad conductor of heat, as furnace ashes and lime, &c. The
emission of heated air into the rooms may be regulated by
valves.  As the pipes are not exposed to cracking, there is
no risk   of their throwing smoke or vapour into                      the rooms.
  The boiler      b,    l,,   is    six feet   long, three and       a   half broad,

  (which    is slightly      inclined) expelling the air, which partly
 escapes by the valve g, and is partly forced into the other
 pipes. The valve g being considerably loaded, forces the
 accumulating steam down into the rest of the pipes d,d,d.
 The air in      these pipes recedes before the steam, and is forced
 through      the tubes      h,k,k,      into the pipe m, m, m, whence
 it escapes at the valve i, and the syphon A. The water, con
 densed in the whole of the pipes, passes also through the
 tubes h,h,li,h, into the pipe m, in, m, which has such a
 declivity as to discharge the water at the syphon k, into the
 hot well n, whence it is pumped back into the boiler.
    The whole of the pipes are of cast iron, except m, m, m,
 which is of copper. The perpendicular pipes serve as pillars
 for supporting the beams of the house, by means of the pro
jecting     pieces     0,0,  u,  which      may be raised or lowered at
pleasure     by the wedges         p, p,p.     The pipes are sunk in the
beams about an inch, and are made fast to them by the iron
 straps  i7, q.      Those in the lower story rest on the stones
s,ststst       and are made tight at the junction with stuffing.
The pipe in         each story supports the one in the story above
by   a stuffed      joint    as  shown at r.      The   pipes in the lower
story are seven inches            in diameter;     those in the higher six
inches    ;  those     in the other two are of intermediate diame
ters.    The thickness of          the metal is three-eighths   of  an inch.
The lower        pipes are made larger than the upper, in order to
expose a greater heated surface in the lower rooms,                  because
the steam being thrown from above into all the pipes, except
the first, would otherwise become incapable of imparting an
equal heat as it descends.
    There is no necessity for valves opening inwards in this
apparatus, the pipes being strong enough to resist the pres
sure of the atmosphere.
    The cotton mill is 60 feet long, 33 wide, and four sto
ries high,      the upper being a garret story.           In the engraving
five parts out       of nine in      the length  of  the building  are only

-T EB. 26. The right honourable the earl            of Morton, vice-
president, in the chair. — Continuation of           Mr. Knight's pa
per on the bark of trees.       This philosopher, after many ex
periments and observations during several years, has come
to  the   following conclusion     :   that  there is a juice in trees
distinct from that which       is elaborated     by the leaves or con
veyed   by   the  alburnum   ;  that    this juice gradually exudes,
and, like all vegetable matter, naturally assumes a regular
form, which at first resembles a honey-comb, and afterwards
unites itself with the alburnum to form vessels fit to convey
the true sap either from the roots to the leaves, or from the
leaves   to the roots, and     in this manner isjmally incorpo
rated with the wood of the tree.          The author was led to this
conclusion chiefly from having observed that the bark of
grafted trees gradually unites and forms an uniform mass,
and that bark on the trunks of trees is speedily regenerated
where the leaves are, perhaps, at            a distance of nearly 20O
feet.   The    theories of Malpighi         and Hales    he considered
very inadequate to the explanation          of these phenomena.

Mr. Rigo     was    read,    containing    a proposal    for a  new com
pensation pendulum.             The failure of all former attempts to
construct pendulums not subject to the changes occasioned
by temperature, induced the author to make some experi
ments with various metals, in the course of which he disco
vered, that of all the modes of compensation, that of triangles
was the best, and accordingly he constructed one of trian
gles, two sides of which were composed of small steel bars,
and the base of brass or zinc, which expands two times
more than steel,        and hence the expansion of the sides was
duly   counteracted       by the expansion of the base.            In this
manner, he alleged, pendulums might be constructed of
two, three, or more series of triangles, that would continue
the same length throughout all climates and seasons.                   The
same idea,    the  author     acknowledged, had occurred to others.

the chair. —A      paper by      Dr. VVollaston,     " On   Fairy Rings,"
\vas read.     Those deep        green circles of    coarse grass seen in
humid    meadows and pasture-ground have occupied the at
tention of several philosophers, in order to be enabled to
give  a satisfactory physical explanation of their origin, pro
gress, and final termination.             Dr. Wollaston having ob
served that fungi were always found on the exterior border
of these rings, thence inferred, that they originated in the
exhausted    state   of  the soil, which could only nourish agarics,
instead of more        perfect    vegetables.    It  yet remains,     how
ever, to be decided        whether this circumstance be an effect or
a cause  of  the phenomena          in question.

    The researches of M. Cuvier upon the fossil grinders ot
elephants having led him to examine some fresh grinders,
and the opportunity he had within these few years of dis
secting two elephants, almost adult, having admitted of his
examining in detail the manner in which the teeth of these
animals grow, he drew frrfin these examples some conclu
sions on dentition in general. We may consider the ana
tomy of large animals as a kind of natural microscope, which
assists better in seeing the anatomy of others.
    M. Cuvier was led to confirm the doctrine of John Hunter,
at least so far as regards the substance         called osseous. Il has
no vessels, and is not formed by intus-susception like true
bones, but a successive transudation of layers produced by
the pulpy nucleus of the tooth, and which are glued the one
over the other. The enamel is deposited above by the mem
brane which envelops the young tooth, and is there fixed by
a kind of crystallization : lastly, a third substance, proper to
certain herbivorous animals, is deposited after the enamel,
but by the same membrane, \vhich changes its nature at a
certain epoch.
    These two last points had also been observed upon smaller
 teeth by K. Blake, an Irish anatomist.
    This thin substance         had   been   originally discovered- by
 M. Tenon, who named             it cortical osseux, but who regards
 it as formed by the ossification of the capsulur membrane.
    This respectable anatomist has continued to communicate
 to us his grand work upon teeth ; and this year he has given us
 a description  of those   of  the cachalot and crocodile.    The teeth
 of the former    have no enamel, but only the osseous cortex.
 The one may     be easily distinguished from the other, because
 the enamel is much harder, and is entirely dissolved in the
 acids, without     leaving any gelatinous parenchyme.             The
 tusks of  the elephant,      and   the  grinders of the bear and     of
 the dugoug,    have no other envelope.
     As M. Cuvier,     in speaking of the teeth of elephants, had
 related  several  observations recently made, both by himself
 and Messrs. Everard,       Home, Corse,         and   R. Blake, natu
                                                                 ralists

  ralisfs or anatomists in England, upon the manner in which
  these teeth are shed and replaced, M. Tenon has presented
 to the class the work he has edited upon the same subject
 for more than twenty-five          years, which contains a great part
  of these observations.
     Distinctly acknowledging           the priority legitimately due to
 this excellent anatomist, 'the class regret that he has so long
 deprived the public of his discoveries, and have earnestly en
 treated him to publish them.
     M.    Tenon is on the point of publishing another work
 upon the eye and its diseases.               He has made several new
 remarks upon the parts which surround this organ : he has
 found,     for instance, some       tendinous lumps which tie the
 straight muscles to the anterior edges          of the orbit, and serve
 them     for  a  kind of returning pulley, and hinder them from
 compressing the eye-ball ; he has developed a membranous
 tunic which surrounds the eye-ball, attaches it to the two
angles of the orbit by two kinds of wings, passes into the
 pupils, and is there reflected behind the tarsi; and lastly,
gives a passage to the tendons            of the muscles.     Other ana
tomists confound           this tunic with the cellaconte     : he disco
vered small ligaments which            join  the extremities  of the tarsi
to the orbit      ;  he has examined the effect      of the various che
mical substances         upon the crystallines : lastly, he has esta
blished     a   new opinion upon the agents which transmit to
the iris the action of the retina, and by which the impres
sions received by tlve latter dilate or contract the other.
M. Tenon         searches for these agents in the ciliary processes,
the tongues         of which   are prolonged behind the iris,    and the
tails of them touch the retina.
    This     indefatigable anatomist has also given us some
account       of the malconformation commonly called hare
lip.     He has found it sometimes proceeding from a rent of
one    of  the    two maxillary bones, sometimes from a rent in
both ; and he attributes the cause of it to a disproportionate
dilatation of the tongue. Sometimes he found the palate
divided behind, and it was then a too rapid increase of the
brain which produced the evil.                Children born without a
toncue, or such as had lost it early by the small-pox, had,
                                                                       on

on the contrary,      the  palate   narrow,       and its cavities filled
   Experience     has taught    M. Tenon that it        is dangerous    to
perform any operation for the hare-lip at ihe time when the
teeth are cutting.
   The   class has witnessed with       great satisfaction a valuable
method of teaching certain branches of anatomy, in the
pieces of artificial anatomy prepared for the School of Me
dicine  by  M. Laumonier, of Rouen.              There is reason to be
lieve that the account given by the School of Medicine of
this new process will contribute to the erection of an esta
blishment where this art will he practised as successfully as
it is in Italy : in the exactitude of the details, and in the truth
of  the imitation,   M. Laumonier       exceeds the Italian school.
    The  class has directed   that these artificial     anatomical pre
parations should be confined to the representation of such
singular or monstrous conformations which rarely occur.
    M. Laumonier has presented to the class one of the most
singular monstrosities which has been ever observed in the
human species, and a conformation which, perhaps, ap
 proaches    more closely than any yet known to a perfect her-
maphroditism.        A woman had, besides all the organs of her
sex, two testicles, well formed, concealed in the folds of the
great labia, and the'vasa deferentia of which end in the bot
tom of the matrix.
    M. Pictet, correspondent      and professor       of physics at Ge
 neva,  has sent to us a drawing       of   a   monstrous colt, born at
Locre, in the county of Neufchatel : it had cloven hoofs,
 representing claws ; its head was larger and shaggier than
usual.     The   peasants killed   it from superstition       ; and they
attributed its malconformation        to  a   fright which   the  mother
had received from two bears that were once shut up in the
 same stable with her.
    A  young physician,     M. Duvernoy,          has presented to the
class a memoir upon the hymen,            where he has shown that
 this singular membrane, hitherto generally regarded as pe
culiar to the human species, is also to be found in every
 animal.
    The  same author has published the three subsequent vo
                                                                   lumes

physiology are considered in the most general manner.
  M. Dumas, correspondent and professor at Montpelier,
has not yet finished his " Grand Physiology," announced by
us some time ago           ;          obliged to give a new
                               and he has been
edition of that which he had already published.
  M. Barthey, correspondent and professor also of Mont
pelier, has reproduced his celebrated work upon "The Ele
ments of the Science of             Man;" which         is   likely to produce         a
happy revolution in physiology.
  The natural but premature desire                   of referring      to the ge
neral laws           of physics     and    chemistry    the       phaenomena         of
living bodies, had suggested to the physiologists of the 17th
and of  one-half of the 18th century, a crowd of hypotheses
equally gratuitous as they are complicated, and which were
very far from conducting them to their object.
  Some men of genius, disgusted with this way of contra
dictory suppositions, thought of applying to living bodies the
method so usefully employed in physical astronomy since the
days   of Newton.
     That great man        discovered      that the movement of the stars,
so complicated in appearance,              was regulated according to cer
tain laws which           he succeeded      in ascertaining ; in a word,
universal gravitation :           and admitting, once for all, in our cal
culations, this general fact, rigorously defined and appreciated,
without examining the cause of                 it,
                                         we may effectually suc
ceed    explaining every phenomenon with precision, and
          in
foretel the time and place           of each with      even more exactitude
than we could have done               by   the longest continued observa
tions.
     This rejection of         the inquiry into first causes,         in    order to
attach ourselves         merely    to an exact determination           of    secon
dary causes,  or the immediate elements of motion, has thus
been   fortunate and productive idea.
          a
  Physiologists, therefore, have done right in imitating                          it,
and much     due to M. Barthes for having invited them to
                 is
itfrom his own success.
     But uow that the utility of this method                 is   no longer con
                                                                             tested,

tested,    some reflections upon the precision necessary to ob
tain from it all that may be expected, will not, perhaps, be
out of place.
   The astronomers ought to be imitated in every particular,
who do not content themselves with vaguely attributing the
celestial phaenomena          to attraction,  but they analyse   these
phaenomena, showing and distinguishing the parts of the
attractions of each of the various bodies, and determining
the measure and the laws of their action; they explain, by
 means of a rigorous calculation and precise observations, that
these laws are in fact constantly the same, and belong to no
arbitrary supposition.
   There is really no meaning in saying simply that living
 bodies have a vital principle, and in attributing to this prin
ciple every thing ,ve cannot explain by other means. To
think that       we have said something useful, wben we say
vaguely,     that  sensibility and contractibility are effects of the
vital principle, in our opinion is both deceiving ourselves
and others by an expression devoid of meaning.
   In order legitimately to compare the employment of the
attraction with that of universal gravitation, it would be ne
cessary     to   analyse  separately    every  phenomenon of life ;
to determine       the share which      the ordinary laws of physics
and chemistry have in them ; and afterwards to compare the
elements of the phaenomena which these two sciences could
not   have     furnished,    to those   which   would have remained
after the analysis of the other phaenomena; to see if all these
unknown elements, extracted, if we may be allowed the ex
pression, each one separately from the various phenomena,
have any thing common             among them ; lastly, to ascertain
the laws to which we are to attribute their common prin
ciple,  if   we find that it exists, since, on combining it with
those of the ordinary sciences, it gives a rational explanation
of all   the phenomena          observed,   and enables us to foretell
with some exactitude          the phaenomena     which would happen
in new circumstances.           It is then only that physiology may
natter itself with possessing a particular principle, as well as
astronomy ; it is then only that we shall be permitted logi
cally to employ the vital principle in reasonings and calcula-

 dispense    with   ascertaining, until new discoveries shall give
 a well grounded hope of ascertaining it.
     But  we ought     to know,     that we cannot      attain this object
 but by bringing to perfection he anatomy and chemistry of
 organized bodies, by incessantly comparing their results with
 the observation     of these bodies, as well in the state       of health
 as disease,    by applying,       in short, this method to all the
 classes  of these bodies, whatever be the complication            of their
 organs and the extent of their faculties.
    The works which daily appear upon the medical and phy
 siological sciences, show how necessary it is to collect these
 principles,    and the present       state  of science admits    of  great
improvements         being    made     in   the particular   branches to
 which I    have above alluded.

   XXXII.     On the Stanhope Temperament of the Musical
                  Scale. By Mr. JOHN FAREY.
                         To  Mr. Tilloch.
WS1R, HEN men     of rank and fortune, like    earl Stanhope, un
dertake the investigation     of difficult points in  the physical
sciences, whatever success      may attend    their labours, their
names     can hardly fail of attracting attention to the subjects
on which      they employ their talents and pens. Such I am
happy to observe to be the case at present; Dr. John Wall
Callcott, an eminent musical writer, having announced his
intention of publishing a work shortly on the Stanhope tem
perament, in order to point out the numerous advantages of
that mode of tuning keyed instruments ; while others appear
to be investigating the nature and peculiar properties of mu
sical intervals with a depth of research which has, unfortu
nately for the science, been hitherto very rare among prac
tical musicians.      In my letter in your November Magazine
 (vol. xxvi. p. 172), on Mr. Hawkes's Treatise on Music,           I
hinted at the diversity of terms or notation, in which musical
intervals have been      usually expressed by the writers who
have treated on those minuter parts,        or intervals, necessary
 to be considered in tempering the scale ; since      which I  have
carefully re-perused lord Stanhope's treatise in your Sep
tember Magazine (vol. xxv. pages 291 to 312) ; and having
 found it necessary to make several calculations and arrange
 ments of the intervals which compose the Stanhope septa ve,
 or douzeave, as his lordship's system of twelve intervals in
 an octave might have been called,       I am   induced to trouble
 you with them, hoping that they will aid and facilitate the
 inquiries, which I have above alluded to, into the merits and
 defects of this mode of dividing the octave.
     My   lord Stanhope, from being furnished with a very caV
 pital and nicely-divided monochord, and with three grand
 piano-fortes of the very best construction, (pages SI 2, 292,
 and 304,) for making his experiments on the musical in
  tervals, appears to have adopted that mode of expressing
     Vol. 87. No.   107.  Afril 1807.      N                     the

  132               On the Stanhope         Temperament
 the results   of his calculations, which, however convenient it
 may prove    in using his monochord (which [apprehend is rather
 a costly instrument), whereon the length of wire for sounding
 C is divided into   1 20 parts, and the decimals of those parts, the
 same is not readily adapted for repeating his experiments on
 the monochords more commonly in use, whereon the length
 for C, or the key note, is made unity, or 1-00000, and the
 same is divided decimally       :   therefore in column      8 of Table I.
 following,     and column 6       of Table    II.  (pages 195, 196, and
  197,) I have reduced his lordship's numbers (xxv. 309.) to
 this scale, the numbers herein being the numbers answering
 to the logarithms in the preceding columns. It appears, how
 ever, necessary .here to remdrk, that musical intervals are of
 that peculiar species of magnitude which cannot                be numeri
 cally defined    by the lengths      of   the strings   which yield the
 sounds; and that every         attempt of that kind is as futile, as
 it would be to attempt the definition             of a. plane surface, or
 bf a solid body,     by one  of   its lineal dimensions.
    For the purposes of comparing the magnitudes of musical
 intervals,   the intervals   of    sounds    themselves may be added
 to each other, or deducted, at pleasure, on an instrument fur
 nished with      a  sufficient    number of adjustable strings, as
 our noble author has shown (p. 292, Sec.): thus any number
 of  the conchords called      Jifths (V)      can be added upwards to
 each other with accuracy,          the point of acuteness, or interval
 from the fundamental         or key note thus obtained, can be
 compared with that obtained by adding in ascent a number
 of octaves (VIII) or other conchords; or we can, from those
 points accurately descend by deducting (or adding in de
 scent) any other of the conchords, as major or minor thirds
 (III  or 3rd), major or minor sixths (VI or 6th), or of minor
fourths (4th), to any fresh points in the scale, from whence
 we may wish to make accurate comparisons with the key
 note, and thence with any other notes in the scale.
    Notwithstanding that this mode of composing intervals
 of sound   is well  known,      and is   in constant     use by tuners  of
 keyed instruments, as organs, harpsichords, piano-fortes,
 &c. } yet no author that 1 have read has yet adopted this
 simple, accurate, and convenient mode of notation or ex
                                                                 pressing,

  pressing, as it is capable of doing, not only every possible
  interval in the diatonic system, but even the almost endless
  variety of intervals which arise, in considering the division
 of harmonic intervals into aliquot parts,            as  is done by his
 lordship in obtaining his bi-equab thirds and tri-equal quints
  (pages 301 and 302) : in this mode* column 5 and column 3
 in my Tables      I  and  II following (which       are titled,    and   are
 to be read,     from    the bottom     upwards) express        all the in
 tervals   mentioned by his lordship, and are to be read thus -.
 c the octave, or VIII, consists of the sum of a third and
 minor sixth      (III  + 6th), of the' sum of a fifth and minor
fourth    (V + 4th), or a sixth and minor third (VI + 3d), Sec.,
 and may be thus tuned as above explained ; always observ
 ing, that the 3d, 6th,        VI,  in this column        are diatonic or
 perfect, and not Stanhope or tempered intervals : b B, or
 the 7th, may be tuned by adding two 4ths in succession, or
 two VIII upwards and two V downwards;                        b A, or the
 Stanhope 6th, by tuning upwards an VIII and a                 III   in suc
 cession, and bisecting the interval thus obtained above C byfc
 a new sound ; of which more hereafter.               It is here to be un
 derstood, as in algebraic notation, that where neither of the.
 signs + or — (denoting addition and subtraction) is af
 fixed to any term or interval in these columns, + is to be
 understood ; as denoting ascent and the tuning or reading
 the interval which it precedes upwards; while — denotes
 that the following term or chord is to be tuned or read down
 wards : at the same time, these signs           '+ and —    may be con
 sidered   as   merely expressing contrariety in the direction in
 which an interval is to be tuned or read; and, if a                III  was
 wanted below       C, instead of above it    at  E,   the expression     \T
  +  V   —  VIII     may have all its      signs changed, viz. —          VI
  —  V   +  VIII,    and the same   will  denote a    VI   and a  V down
 wards in succession, and          thence an      VIII   upwards, which
 will bring    us to a note called    b  A, which      is the diatonic, or
 perfect major third (III) below the key note C.
     Gentlemen who are conversant in the management of
 vulgar fractions, and no others should think of comparing
 the    relations    of musical intervals, will see no difficulty
 in adding or subtracting any of the intervals contained in

interval required, and appears to be his lordship's                     It-equal
third. See No. 6 in Table II.
    As     an example       of   the meaning and uses          of column       1  in
Table       I,   we might have inquired what is the value of thid
interval                      in hatfnotes or number of finger-key in
tervals      :  thus, the   VIII      containing     12, and the      III   4 half
notes, we have                     -,  equal to four    half notes, which          is
found to answer in the table to                  E or the   III ; but is in this
 case a bi-equal third instead of a diatonic III, the minute
difference of which intervals, is not taken into account when
we speak of, or estimate by, the half notes of music writers
 arid instrument makers.
    It    is only when musical intervals are supposed                   perfectly
 equal among themselves               (each  -fa of a lineal  octave)   that   they
 can be added together, and treated as                we have last done ; and
 the arithmetical differences of the lengths of strings, or even
 of the fractions expressing those lengths, cannot, as before
 observed, represent " the value" of intervals, or even of
 the error or difference between two intervals, as they are
 said to do by our noble author, at the bottoms of pages 294
 and 296, last          paragraph but one in page 301, fourth para
 graph page 302, and in all the instances in the last column
 of the table at page 311 ; mistakes, of which the student
 should be particularly aware.

    200                  On the Stanhope Temperament
    which they denominated a comma (No. 16 in Table II),
    whose logarithm is -0053950 or 53950 ; and it has been
   usual with modern authors, in considering the temperaments
    of  the musical scale, to express       the deviations from the true
   chords, or temperaments, in parts of a comma ; accordingly
   we have     J j j;g for this fraction, which is equivalent in small
   numbers to f^c nearly, or about one part in 21 less than a
   comma: it remains to explain, that columns, Table I,
   contains the true or diatonic ratios of the conchordfr men
   tioned in the 4th column.
       I proceed now to make           a  few remarks, which occur in
   turning over      the   pages  of his lordship's    essay in your Ma
   gazine (which       I request  the reader  to page with his pen from
   291 to 312).        The true value of the small interval called the
   quint wolf,      deduced    from experiment in page 293, and cal
   culated at the bottom of page 294, will be found in No. 15
   of my Table II, where the result agrees with his lordship's ;
   but the difference of the terms of his ratio, in the last line,
   should be expunged, as useless and calculated to mislead, as
   before observed.
      In pages 295 and 296 his lordship speaks of four wolves
  in the major thirds, whereas there is but one such interval,
  which for distinction I have called the tierce wolf, and
  shown its value in No. 14 of Table               II;   where it must be
  evident that this interval,       VIII   — 3  III,  owing to the equa
  lity of all the octaves, whether taken above C, G, D, A, E,
 or any other of the 12 notes, is always of the same value,
  and is no more the C wolf than that of any other letter in
 the gamut : what could have induced his lordship to limit
 his inquiries respecting the major thirds in his essay, to the
 five columns in pages 295 and 310, is to me a mystery.
     What     is said    in the two last paragraphs of page 297, and
 continued in the next page,           also at the bottom of page 299,
 respecting the proper object of temperament,               on account of
Jive    wolves    being   assumed   in the  quints   and  tierces, without
 noticing those in the sixi6mes, appears to me unsatisfactory.
     The remarks        at the top  of page 299 apply equally against
 tempered       consonances in any system whatever, as they dp
 against the isotonic or equal temperament.              The exact value
                                                                        of.

                            of the Musical Scale.                      .
of                           from experiment in page 301,
     the bi-equal third, deduced
and calculated in page 311, will be found in my Table II,
No. 6.
     A
     very radical defect in the application of the Stanhope
temperament   to practice, as directed by his lordship, now
presents itself in the mistake made in the third paragraph of
page  301, and the third paragraph in page 302, in supposing
that equal temperaments of two successive thirds^ or of three
successive     fifths,      effected by means       of geometric                 mean pro
portionals interposed between the extremes in each case (as
mentioned at the top of page 301, and third paragraph in
page 302), and on which all his lordship's calculations arc
found to be grounded (and to agree very exactly with my
calculations upon the same principles), produce     equality
                                                                                  "
of the beatings," by which, says his lordship,
                                                 " equal de
viations from perfection may be correctly ascertained."
     For            of showing the inconsistency of the two
           the purpose
methods here proposed, for obtaining equal temperaments to
a succession of the same conchords, I shall refer to the beau
tiful theory of imperfect consonances laid down by the late
Dr. Robert Smith in his Harmmiics^ or rather to the late
professor Robison's popular explication of the same, in his
article Temperament, in the Supplement to the Encycl-opedia.
Britannica, 3d edit. vol. ii. p. 65G and 657.
   Referring to his lordship's table at page 303, vol. xxv. of
your Magazine, I take the last step or process of the tuning,
and consider, that the note C in the middle septave, according
to the present concert-pitch,   occasions about 240 complete
vibrations in the air in one second of time, (see Sup. Ency.

inversely as their lengths, we have 240 x    = 20 for the        -J-             1

quoted (published in 1801), contains a calculation and ex
periment on the beats made by a succession of equally tem
pered fifths, and mentions, that each fifth in ascending
beats   half   as fast again   as the preceding one ;     which is also
the result      of my calculations above : and the same follows
immediately from Dr. Smith's original theorem.
    Instead of the three fifths, Gd, da, and at, each fiat'
tened by £ of a comma (as is done by his lordship in his cal
culations and table, p. 309), producing equality of the beat
ings, I find by a calculation (not direct, but approximating)
that the fifth Gd must be flattened about -ffa of a comma ;
the   fifth   da, about -JJL- of a comma; and the       fifth  ae± about
•rVo- of a comma, in order         to make these      successive fifths
 beat equally quick,      the rate   of which will      be found about
 3-16 times per second in each case ; the note d making about
 263*4, and the note a about 401*0 vibrations per second,
 when thus tempered.
    The     value  of the tri-equal quint, deduced by experiment
 in page 302 of his lordship's treatise, and calculated at
 page 311, is shown in No. 5 of my Table II.
     In  pages 30-1, 305, 8cc.,    where perfect thirds or thirds are
 mentioned by his lordship, the major, or III, is to be un
  derstood.
     From the first experiment, in         page 304,     the tierce  wolf
  results  :  see No.   14 in Table   II.
     The value of     a major   third in the scale  of equal    tempera
  ment, third experiment, page 304, is shown        No.    8 in the same
  table ; and where      No.  4 exhibits  thefifth of   that scale, hav
  ing  a temperament only tVths        of that of a tri-equal quint !
     The minor thirds (3d), and resulting major sixths              (VI),
  appear to me to have        been   too slightly passed over by his
  lordship in the note at page 305, and not to have had their
  temperaments in the Stanhope scale sufficiently examined
  and considered ; especially as the VI must, in full harmony,
  continually     be used  with the III, on which so much stress
  has been laid.       The values of the 3d, 6th, and VI, with
  their principal relations to other conchords, will be found
  Nos. 12, 2, and 1, in my Table II.
                                                                      fhc

  S04                On the Stanhope Temperament
  ,  The   values   of all the intervals in his lordship's table, page
 311, some     of which have been already mentioned, will be
 found in my Table II.
    Twelve successions of four major sixths each, may (as in
 the case of the     Iil,  before mentioned) be carried on upwards
in tuning,      and compared with the third octave ; another
wolf    is  thus    produced, which we call the slxiSme wolf,
No. 13 in Table II, and is so considerable an interval as
nearly to equal three commas !
    I beg here to remark, that Nos. 13, 14, and 15, besides
representing, in the two last columns, the differences between
the sixicme,      tierce,   and quint wolfs, and the key-note re
spectively ; represent also, No. 13, the minor third wolf, or
VIII— 43ds, and likewise the VI and 3d wolf, or VI — 33ds:
No.    14 represents      the minor sixth  wolf, or 2 VIII — a6ths;
and likewise the 6th and III wolf, or 2 III — 6th : and
No. 15 represents the minor fourth wolf, or i«4ths — 5VIII,
and likewise the V and 4-th wolf, or ?4ths — 5V.
    Thus nine out of the twenty-one wolves which may arise,
by comparing together every two of (he seven conchords, viz.
3d, III, 4th, V, 6th, VI, and VIII, (including all of those
with VIII), have been examined, and produce only three
different intervals : the remaining twelve wolves I have not
leisure at present to examine, but the mode of doing so is
sufficiently evident from these tables, and also of comparing
all the other combinations of the seven conchords ; from a
complete table of which, a clearer insight into the natural
scale  of music would        be obtained than has, perhaps, yet been
had.
    I recommend to the reader of lord Stanhope's mode of
tuning, pages 300 to 302, to lay my Table I. before him,
and to compare the tuneable intervals in column 5 with each
step  of his lordship's process, as he goes along, by which
the reason for each step will the better appear.
    On the whole, I would not be considered as now giving
an opinion on the merits of the Stanhope temperament, com
pared with those of M. Kirnberger (p. 302), Dr. Young,
Mr, Hawkes (xxvi. 171), See. &c., but rather as anxious to
                                                                assist

Assist the inquiries         of  those  who, possessing more leisure
than my professional duties at present leave me, may be dis
posed to examine it thoroughly in all its bearings.
    Conceiving that the notation by tuneable intervals, rather
than by T, t, and H, or tone major, tone minor, and kemi-
tone, which Sauveuri Dr. Smith, Maxwell, Hawkes, and
other writers on the scale of music have used, will greatly
facilitate the study of this curious and useful subject, I have
composed a table of all the combinations of the musical
primes     l,   2, 3, and 5, which when multiplied do not in any
case exceed 10,000; and another table of these composite
or musical numbers             (174 in number),       arranged numeri
cally, with their factors and logarithms annexed ; by which,
in every possible case, any fraction or ratio, neither of whose
terms exceed four places of figures, can be resolved into
tuneable intervals ; and, on the contrary, any combination
Of tuneable intervals in whole numbers can be resolved into a
vulgar fraction or ratio, and its logarithm obtained, without
reference to any other tables : these tables, with examples
of their    uses,    I intended    to have sent herewith ; but fearing
that    I have     already   exceeded    the limits  of articles in your
 Magazine, I shall        defer them to another opportunity.
    I  have too high an        opinion of earl Stanhope's liberality of
mind,       and    zeal for  the  discovery of scientific truth, to offer
any apology for the freedom with which I have examined
and commented on his treatise; and should the pending                   in
vestigations of Dr. Callcott and others, comparing               the beats
made      by every concord among themselves, as well as with
 the key note, ultimately pronounce in favour of the Stan-
 Iiope temperament,        the actual number    of  beats of the tri-equal
 quints and        bi-equal thirds can" be readily calculated, and,
 when arranged in tables, can be as easily applied in tuning
 without      a  monochord or glasses, as if the numbers had been
 equal; for they must have been counted during a given space
 of time, in order to ascertain that equality with the necessary
 precision.      -

powerful       means to the perfecting          of  an instrument       capable
of performing           in Maxwell's,       complete     diatonic scale, not
doubting but the greatest astonishment and delight would
be felt, from hearing performances upon such an instrument.

                   Sawing.     By JOHN TROTTER, Esq.*
W ITH
        GENTLE MEN,
          the view of obviating many difficulties and ex
penses, which have long attended the operations of those
requiring curvilinear sawing in their trade, and of public
bodies        connected with those trades,            through the licentious
and refractory conduct            of sawyers, it       has been           represented
to me  as a measure extremely desirable, to adopt more ge
nerally mechanical powers, could such be discovered as
would preclude much mystery and manual labour.
  Considering the subject in a national point of view, as
connected with our naval yards in the formation of timber ;
with our military departments, in respect to wheels of every
description; with our whale and herring fisheries; our pub
lic   and private breweries and distilleries;             our East and West
India companies,             and other bodies         depending on cooper
ages,        as well as other     minor      trades   peculiarly liable to the
evils complained of, I invented a curvilinear saw, which,
with liule aid of the most ignorant labourer, answers every
purpose.
      Having       effected these ends, suffer me to solicit the honour
of your acceptance of             a model,       together with      drawing of
                                                                      a
my saw, sufficiently accurate for the use of                   those in remote
Situations to work by, who may wish to use or make them.

bookbinders,        the   invention of Mr. James Hardie, book
binder, Glasgow.            The inventor claims no other merit than
that of having simplified the common press, rendered it more

from his residence      ; an object which he .thinks cannot be so
well attained     in any other way,       as by   the publicity   which
the Society is able to give to improvements           deserving of its
notice.
   The improvement of this simple instrument              has cost   Mr.

   The principal difference      between    this and the press which
has been for time immemorial           employed by the bookinders,
consists in effecting the business         by one iron screw instead
of two wooden        ones formerly used.       This screw works in a
nut let into and fastened to the top piece       A, (Fig. 5. Plate V.)
its lower end working in a collar, fastened to the moving
piece B, sliding in grooves           within the two sides of the
frame.      CC   are the guides for the plough,        as  in  the com

 XXXV.        Account     of the   Fall of Part of     the    Rosenberg
    Mountain, in      September    180(3.   By  the Rev.    Mr. Buck-
    minster, of Boston, North America, hit                then residing
    in Switzerland.
 If   you have a large map of Switzerland, I beg you to look
 for a spot in the canton of Sehwcus, situated between the
                                    0  2                            lakes

     810                   Account    of  the  Tall
     lakes of Zug and Eowertz on two sides, and the mountain^
     of Rosenberg   and Rosi on the others. Here, but three weeks
    ago, was one of the most delightfully fertile valleys of all
    Switzerland ; green and luxuriant, adorned with several little
    villages full of secure and happy farmers.         Now,      three    of
    these villages are for ever effaced from the tarth,   and a broad
    waste of ruins, burying alive 1400 peasants, overspreads the
   valley of Lowertz.
       About five o'clock in the evening of the, 3d of September,
   a large projection of the mountain of Rosenberg on the north-
   cast gave way, and precipitated itself into this valley     :   in less
   than four minutes it completely overwhelmed the three vil
   lages of Gnldau, Busingen, and Rathjen, with a part of
  Lowertz and Oberart. The torrent of earth and stones was
  far more rapid than that of lava, and its effects as irresistible,
  and as terrible.     The mountain in its descent carried trees,
  rocks, houses, every thing before it.           The mass spread in
  every direction, so as to bury completely a space of charm
  ing country more than three miles square ! The force of the
  earth    must have been prodigious, since it not only spread
  over the hollow of the valley, but even ascended far up the
  opposite side of the Rigi. The quantity of earth, too, is enor
 mous, since it has left    a  considerable hill in what was before
 the centre of the vale.       A  portion of the falling mass rolled
 into the lake of -Lowertz, and it is calculated that a fifth part
 is filled up. On a minute map you will see two little islands
 marked in this lake, which have been admired for their pic-
 turesqueness. One of them is famous for the residence of
 two hermits, and the other for the remains of an antient
 chateau, once belonging to the house of Hapsbcrg.                      So
large a body of water was raised and pushed forward by the
falling of such      a mass    into the lake, that the two islands,
and      the whole village  of Seven,    at the  northern extremity,
were for a time completely submerged by the passing               of   the
swell.      A  large house   in this village was lifted off its foun
dations, and carried half a mile beyond its place.          The her
mits were absent on a visit to the abbey of Einsidein.
     The disastrous consequences of this event extend further
than the loss of such a number of inhabitants in a canton of
                                                                    little

                  of Part of the Rosfnberg Mountain.                   21 1
   little population: — a fertile plain is at once converted into a
  barren tract of rocks and calcareous earth, and the former
  marks and boundaries of property are obliterated. The main
  road from Art to Schweitz is completely filled up, so that
  another must be opened, with great labour, over the Rigi.
  The former channel of a lara;e sin-urn is choked up, and
  its course altered; and       as the   ouilets and passage of large
  bodies of water must be affected by the filling up of such
  a portion     of the lake, the neighbouring villages are still
  trembling    with  apprehension of some remote consequences,
  against which they know not how to provide.               Several hun
  dred men have been employed in opening passages for the
  stagnant waters, in forming a new road for foot passengers
  along the Rigi, and in exploring the ruins.              The different
  cantons have contributed to the relief of the suffering canton
  of Schweitz,    and every head is at      work   to contrive means to
 prevent further disasters.
      The number of inhabitants buried alive under the rnin of
 this mountain is scarcely less than 1500.             Some even esti
 mate it as high     as   2000.    Of  these, a woman and two       chil
 dren     have been found alive, after having been several           days
 under ground.        They affirm, that while they were thus en
 tombed they heard the cries of poor creatures who were pe
 rishing around them for want of that succour which they
 were so fortunate as to receive.            Indeed, it U the opinion
 of many well-informed          people that a large number might
 still   be recovered   ;  and a writer in the PuMiciite of Paris
goes so far as    to blame the inactivity of the neighbouring
inhabitants,     and   quotes    many well-attested facts to prove
 that persons have lived a long time buried under snow and
earth.      This at least is probable in the present case, that
many houses, exposed to lighter weight than others, may
have been merely a little crushed ; while the lower story,
which in this part of Switzerland is frequently of stone, may
have remained firm, and thus not a few of the inhabitants
escaped unhurt.         The consternation into which the neigh"
bouring     towns  of Art and Schweitz were thrown, appears,
indeed, to have left them incapable             of contriving  and e*e-
                                   O 3                            cuting

cuting those labours which an enlightened compassion would
 dictate.
    The mountain of Rosenberg, as well as the Rigi and other
mountains in its vicinity, are composed of a kind of brittle
calcareous earth and pudding-stone or aggregated rocks,
Such a prodigious mass as that which fell, would easily
crumble by its own weight, and spread over a wide surface.
The    bed of the mountain from which ihc desolation came,
is a plane inclined from north to south.           Its appearance as
it  is now laid bare would lead one to suppose        that the mass,
when first moved from its base, slid for some distance before
it precipitated itself into the valley. The height of the Spits-
berg (the name of the projection which fell) above the lake
 and valley of Lowertz was little less than 2000 feet.            The
 composition of the chain of the Rigi, of which the Rosen
berg makes     a part, has always been an obstacle        in the way.
of   those  system-makers      who have built      their hypotheses
upon the structure of the Alps.           It has nothing of granite
in its whole mass; and, though nearly 6000 feet above the
sea, is green, and even fertile, to its summit.          It is com
posed    of nothing    but  earth  and   stone,  combined     in rude
masses.     It is also remarkable that the strata      of which it is
composed are distinctly    inclined  from   the north to the south ;
a character which is common to all rocks of this kind through
the whole range of Alps, as well as to the greater part of
calcareous, schistous, and pyritous rocks, and also to the
whole chain of the Jura.
   It   was about    a week after the fall of the mountain that
our route through Switzerland led us to visit thi^ scene of
desolation ; and never can I forget the succession of melau-
choly views which presented themselves to our curiosity.
In   our way to it we landed at Art, a town situated at the
southern extremity of the lake of Zug ; and we skirted along
the eastern boundary of the ruins, by the side of Mount
Rigi, towards the lake of Lowertz. From various points on
our passage we had complete views of such a scene of de
struction as no words can adequately describe.
   Picture to yourself a rude and mingled mass of earth and
                                                              stones,

                  of Part of the Roienbcrg Mountain.                      213
stones, bristled with        the shattered part of wooden cottages,
and with thousands of heavy trees torn up by the roots, and
projecting in every direction.             In one part you might see a
range of peasants' huts which the torrent of earth had reached
with just force enough to overthrow and tear in pieces, but
without bringing soil enough to cover them. In another
were mills        broken in pieces by huge rocks separated from
the top of the mountain, which were even carried high up
the opposite side of the Rigi.                 Large pools of water were
formed       in different    parts    of    the  ruins,    and    many little
streams, whose usual channels had been                      filled up, were
bursting out in various places.                  Birds of prey, attracted
by the smell of dead bodies, were hovering all over the
valley.       But the    general   impression made upon us by the
sight of such an extent of desolation, connected too with
the idea that hundreds of wretched creatures were at that
moment alive buried tinder           a mass     of earth,   and inaccessible
to the cries and labours        of their friends,      was too horrible to
be described       or understood.        As we travelled along the bor
ders   of  this  chaos   of ruined    buildings, a ppor peasant, bear
ing a countenance ghastly with woe, came up to us to beg
a piece of money.           He had three children buried under the
ruins of     a cottage, which he was endeavouring to clear away.
A   little further on we cam.e to an elevated spot which over
looked the whole scene.             Here we found          a   painter seated
on a rock, and busy in sketching                   its horrors.      He had
chosen a most favourable point.                   Before him, at the di
stance    of  more than a league, rose the Rosenberg, from whose
bare side had rushed         the destroyer of all' this life and beauty.
On his right was the lake of Lowertz, partly filled with the
earth of the mountain.            On the banks of this lake was all
that remained        of the town of Lowertz.            Its church    was de
molished,       but the tower yet stood and the ruins, shattered
but not thrown down.               The figures which animated this
part    of   the   drawing    were    a   few miserable peasants, left
to grope among the wrecks of their village.                         The fore
ground      of  the  picture  was  a  wide    desolate   sweep   of earth and
f tones, relieved by the shattered roof of a neighbouring cot-

   tage.    On   the left hand spread the blue and tranquil surface
   of   the lake   of Zug, on the margin of which yet         stands .the
   pleasant village of Art, almost in contact with            the ruins,
   and trembling even in its preservation.
       We   proceeded,    in our descent,     along the side of the Rigi,
   toward the half buried village of Lovvertz.              Here we saw
   the poor curate, who is said to have been a spectator of the
   fall of the mountain.          He saw the torrent of earth rushing
   toward his village, overwhelming half his people, and stop
   ping just before his door. What a situation ! He appeared,
   as we passed,     to be superintending       the  labours of some    of
   the survivors who          were exploring the ruins of the place.
   A   number of new-made graves, marked with a plain pine
   cross, showed where a few of the wretched victims of this
   catastrophe had just been interred.
       Our course lay along the borders of the enchanting lake
   of Lowertz. The appearance of the slopes on the eastern
   and southern sides told us what the valley of Goldau was
   a few days since ; smiling with varied vegetation, gay with
   villages and cottages, and bright with promises of autumnal
   plenty.    The shores of this lake were covered with ruins of
  huts, with furniture and clothes, which the vast swell of
  its waters    had   lodged on the banks.         As  we  were walking
  mournfully along toward Schweitz, we met with                 the   dead
  body of a woman which had been just found.                      It  was
  Stretched    out on a board, and barely covered with a white
  cloth.     Two men, preceded by a priest, were carrying it to
  a more dtcent burial.           We hoped that this sight would have
  concluded the horrors of this day's scenery, and that we
  should soon escape from-^very painful vestige of the calamity
  of Schweitz.        But we continued to find relics of ruined
  buildings for a league along the whole extent of the lake ;
  and a little beyond the two islands mentioned above, we saw
  lying on the     shore     the  stiff body of   a peasant  which    had
.
  been    washed    up by the waves, and which two men were
  examining, to ascertain the place to which he belonged.
  Our guide instantly knew it to be the body of one of the in
  habitants of Goldau.           But I will mention no more .particu
                                                                     lars.

                   of Part of the Rosenlerg Mountain.                           215
Jars.  Some, perhaps, that have been related to me are not
credible, and others which are credible are too painful.
 .   The immediate   cause of this calamitous event is not yet
sufficiently  ascertained, and probably never will hp.    The
fall,of parts of hills is not uncommon, and in Switzerland
especially there are several instances recorded of the descent
of   large masses        of   earth and     stone.   But   so sudden and ex
tensive  a ruin as this, was, perhaps, never produced by the
fall of a mountain-     It can be compared only to the de
struction occasioned by the tremendous eruptions of JEtna,
and Vesuvius.     Many persons suppose that the long and
copious rains which they have lately had in this part of
Switzerland           may have swelled the fountains in the Rosenberg
sufficiently to push this part of the mountain off its inclined
base.    But we saw no marks of streams issuing from any
part      of   the bed   which     is laid bare.
                                        Perhaps the consistency
of    the earth in the interior of the mountain was so much
altered  by the moisture which penetrated into                     it,   that the
projection of the Spitsberg was no longer held                         by   a   suf
ficiently strong cohesion, and its own weight carried      over.         it
Perhaps, as the earth       calcareous,
                                   is      kind of fermentation
                                                     a
took place sufficient- to loosen its foundations.   But there                     is
no     end to conjectures.           The mountain        ha*   fallen, and the
villages are no more.                   .
     If
      we had not been detained at Strasburg waiting for pass
ports for ten days, we should have been in Switzerland on
the 3dof September, probably in the vicinity of                          the lake
of Lowertz perhaps under the ruins of Goldau.

          To   Dr. C. Tayhr,
             Secretary, &c.
    Fig.  1.  (Plate     VI.)   represents a longitudinal section of the
stove,   showing        the   course of the air from its entrance into
the flues    of   the stove at      A,    to  its  entrance into the upper
chamber of       the stove at B       :  and also the course     of the smoke
from the fire-place at C, till it escapes from the stove at D.
E, E,    are the doors or openings of the fire-place and ash-
hole.
    Fig. 2. is a similar section at right angles with the above,
exhibiting the course of the air through the chambers of the
stove, from its entrance into the chamber No. 1. at B to its
entrance beneath the tire-place at F. This figure also shows
sections of the flues, with the divisions through which the
air and smoke pass separately, the smoke-flue in the centre,
and the air-flues on each side. G, G, are doors and openings
through which the articles to be dried are introduced into the
chambers.
    When the fire is lighted, and the doors of the chamber;*,
ash-hole, and fire-place, closed, the air by which the fire
is supplied enters at A, fig. 1, passes through the air-flues
a, a, a, a, enters the upper chamber at B, traverses and de-i

   * From   Transactions   of  the Society   of Arts, &c. — The silver medal was
voted to Mr.   Field for this improvement.
                                                                          neath

            Improved Slave     for    Heating    Rooms,   &c.        2J7
neath the fire at     F, fig.  2.    Having supplied the fire with
pxygen, it      passes  through      the flue with the smoke, and
escapes at    D, heating in its protracted course         the chambers
and air-flues.
    As the cold air enters        the stove at   A,  immediately above
a plate    forming the top of the fire-place, and pursues a
similar route with the fire-flue, it enters the chambers very
much heated and rarefied.              Hence any moist substance
placed   in  the chambers evaporates       in consequence, not only
of the heated flues circulating round them, but of a stream
of warm rarefied air, which, while it continually raises eva
poration, as continually bears away the exhaled moisture in
its passage to the fire, thus imitating the gradual and effica
cious plan of nature in drying by the sun and air. While
these effects are taking place within the stove, part of the
air which enters at A. fig. 1 and 2, p.sses through air-flues
on the other side of the fire-flue, pursues a parallel course
with the first, and give? out a current of warm air to the
room at an aperture          H.     This effect   may be obtained in a
much higher degree,        if the doors    of   the chambers and ash-
hole are opened : should the hand or face be then brought
near, they would be fanned with a stream of warm air, espe
 cially from the upper chamber.
    By means of this stove I have        evaporated milk to drynea't
 without burning or discolouring it ; and have dried cherries,
plums, and other fruits, so as to imitate those which are re
ceived from abroad.         I have repeatedly dried colours and die
most delicate substances without the slightest injury to them,
 even though the operation proceeded           quickly.
    The height of the stove is about 5£ feet; its diameter 2£
 feet, and that of the flues 4 inches.              The external partis
 constructed of brick, and the internal parts of thin Ryegate
 or fire-stone,    except the top of the fire-place, whidi is a
 plate  of  cast iron.   Were it to'be wholly formed of iron, its
 effects would necessarily be more powerful.
    Fig.   3. represents    an   extension    of   the plan,  in which
 stoves  of this kind     may     be advantageously connected       with
 one or more furnaces for chemical or other uses.              The  fire
 place, brought out, either in front           or on one side, by the
                                                                 present

  nace, or will make       a sand-bath by reversing it.
     The space occupied by the fire-place in fig. 1, may in
  this be converted into apartments for evaporating substances,
  or occasionally for cooling them by an opening at K to admit
  cold air, while the warm air of the stove is excluded by a
  register or door. The dotted lines show the manner in which
  a second   furnace may be connected by an opening into tha
 Sue at L.
     In addition to the uses already pointed out, this stove
 would probably be found extremely serviceable in drying
japanners' goods, and consuming the noxious fumes and
 gas which     arise  from the oil and varnish used in this bu
 siness.
     Since the stove is not limited to any certain dimensions,
 it might be adapted to the drying of malt and hops, perhaps
 of herbs, corn,       and   seeds generally.   It might  also be ac
 commodated to the purposes of the sugar-bakers, connected
 with    the great fires they employ for their boilers.          It has
 been shown to be useful in the confectioner's art, and prcr
 bably it may be equally so in baking biscuits for the navy ;
 nor less so in' drying linen for the laundress, dyer, calico-
 printer, and bleacher.        I have myself found it w,ell accom
modated for     a  chemical elabontory.
    The efficacy of the stove in ventilating, boiling, and steam
ing, may easily be shown.           In manufactories and rooms,
generally, the heaied and noxious part of the atmosphere
ascends towards the ceiling: if then the air-flue M, fig. 3,
is continued upward according to the height of the room in
which it is placed, the air will be drawn from the top, and
the room become         ventilated, while from the opening at        N
it is supplied,    if requisite, with   warm air.
    It is unnecessary     to  show the various ways in which a
boiler may be connected          with this plan : it is sufficient to
observe, that in the space allotted for the fire-place in fig. 1,
there is sufficient room within the body of the stove for this
purpose ; and that if the circulating air be made to pass over
the boiler, evaporation may be carried on very e^peditiously
by the air removing the vapour as it arises.         finally, if an
                                                                 other

         New Observations on Volcanoes and their Lava.                Jig
         division of the flues be made          in the manner shown
 fig. 2, it might form a steam-pipe or flue, running the course
 of the air and fire-flues to convey steam to one or more
apartments      of the  stove,   or extended beyond the stove for
heating the room in which it stands. One of the air-flues
might occasionally be adapted to this use.                  It is obvious
that the power of steam in a heated apartment would be not
only greater, but better kept up. In steaming it would be
necessary to close the apartments of the stove, and to give
air to the fuel by a different course.
    As the stove is not confined in its dimensions, so neither
is it necessarily of the form described in the drawing, nor
are   the apartments necessarily trVee : all these particulars
admit of variation according to local or other circumstances.
It is evident that the air-flues th'emselves may be converted
into chambers for drying, &c. ; and the fire-place of fig. 3,
is well adapted lo receive an apparatus for the decomposi
tion of coal, Stc.; for producing all the effects of the thermo-
lamp, or illuminated smoke, &c. But it is needless to enu
merate the many (Economical and philosophical                     uses to
which     the stove   may be applied.          It is sufficient for the
present purpose if I have rendered the principle and plan
intelligible, the artist and manufacturer will then be at no
loss in adapting it to the particular object which he may re
quire it to accomplish.
XXXVII.        New Observations      on Volcanoes       and their Lava.
                         By G. A. DE Luc.
                    [Concluded from vol. xxii. p. 271.]
JV1. HUMBOLDT, considering            basaltes as    of  aqueous forma
tion, attributes    the same origin      to obsidian and to what he
calls basaltic porphyries.      If all the volcanic products, which
at the first glance do not seem to have been treated by fire,
ought to be considered as natural rocks, there are very few
antk-nt lavas which could be recognised as a product of fire".
It is thus that count de Borch, who had nevertheless visited
          has said that its fundamental stone is         a granite mixed
                                                                     with

  220      New Observations        on Volcanoes and their     Lava.
  with jasper; and Mr. Kinvan after him, and also father De
 la Torre, were persuaded that Vesuvius and ./Etna are not
 products of fire, their bases being, as they say, marine stones.
     1 must further remark, that if we refuse to regard as pro
 ducts of the fire all the volcanic substances that our furnaces
 vitrify in a higher degree than the volcanoes do, there are
 very few which can be considered as marine,               since our fur
 naces reduce them to a much more perfect vitrification.
    The basaltic porphyries mentioned by            M. Humboldt       may
 rather be the source         of all the porphyries he mentions.          It
 is even doubtful        if the Chimboraco      is really a volcano.      It
is almost probable, he says, that it is of a volcanic nature.
 If it is only a probability in his idea, it is not astonishing
that the substances which constitute it appeared to him to
be porphyries, or any other natural rock.
    I  collected upon the sea shore at Portici several fragments
of   rolled lava, which, if we were determined to sec nothing
else than porphyries,          might very easily be taken for    as  many
varieties of this rock.
    "   The porphyries in       the neighbourhood      of Riobamba and
Tunguragua         (says   M. Humboldt)     are  2080 toises thick."
    According to the measurements made at Peru by the
French academicians (which I shall have occasion to men
tion again) the height of Tunguragua is S623 toises above the
level of the sea ; and that of the soil of Quito, situated in the
same valley with Riobamba3is 1462. There remain, therefore,
 1161 toises      as   the elevation of the Tunguragua above the
valley.      Its form is a regular cone, which is the form of all
volcanoes, and this cone, which is prolonged outwards far
below the valley, is composed of volcanic substances only ;
for,   as  I   have    already  remarked, every volcano, whatever
be its height,        is an accumulation      of subtances forced out
successively by one or more mouths.               In this state of things
we could scarcely find room at Tunguragua, and its envi
rons, for a thickness of porphyry of 2080 toises.
    Three years ago M. Hergen, professor of mineralogy in
the Museum of Madrid, who is mentioned by M. Ilum-
bnldt, sent me, among other things, three specimens of
substances from           Tunguragua,     named,     according    to  eti
                                                                  quette,

          New Observations        on Volcanoes and their     Lava:       221
 quette, tumngagua.           One of these specimens is of an almost
 compact lava ; the other is of a spongy lava ; and the third
 is a pumice stone. The compact lava contains several small
 whitish crystalline       laminae,     which strongly resemble those
 of   the lavas   of iElna,     and give to this lava an appearance of
 porphyry,      which may have induced M. Humboldl to regard
 it as porphyry.        This volcano is towards the east, opposite
  to Ciiiniiioni , o, and some leagues north from Riobamba*
     M. Bouguer, one of the academicians sent to Peru in
 order to measure the degrees of the meridian, gives a more
 precise idea of the substances which compose the volcanoes
 of that country.         Upon his return from this long and labo
 rious voyage, he gave an account of it to the Academy of
 Sciences on the 14th of November 1744, and we find in his
 discourse the following observations*            :
      " We have an opportunity at Peru             of seeing    the interior
 of   the earth to a great depth, because          it is every    where cut
  into deep ravines.          Many of them have been discovered
  200 toises broad, and 60 or 80 deep ; some are even twice
  as large.     It is only necessary      to descend    into them in order
  to see all the qualities      of  the different beds ; no fossil what
  ever is discovered        in them.      We    see   plenty of that black,
  kind of sand which is attracted by the magnet ; and we are
,able to ascertain, in general, that the layers we observe there,
  and the shades of which are very distinct, far from being
  the effect   of different alluvial deposits,        are rather caused by
  the expansion      of  the substances     vomited fortli by volcanoes;
  almost every thing seen in these ravines being the work of
  fire. Some of these mountains, even to a great depth, are
  formed     of nothing       else   than scoriae,    pumice-stones, and
  fragments of burnt         stones    of all sizes; and sometimes the
  whole is concealed under a layer of common earth, which
   produces herbs and even trees.            I have seen beds of burnt
   stones reduced into very small morsels, almost as thick u*
   the height of five or six men, chiefly at the bottom of the
   Cotopaxi, which has become a perfect truncated cone, and
   of which the summit has been carried off. The bottom of

form,  by the overflowing of all those matters which have
not been pushed out with sufficient force, or which were too
Kght to roll to a distance. If we were to count the diffe
rent eruptions of the Cotopaxi by the multitude of different
layers of burnt stones which are at the foot of    without                       it,

                                      been
as   they are differently arranged in the bosom of the moun
tain."
     With      slender knowledge of Hthology and geology
               the
which        times afforded, M. Bouguer turned his attention
            the
to the substances of these mountains which attracted his no
tice ;    and according to what he has said on the subject, and
from the manner in which                          he expresses        himself,     we easily
perceive that every thing                    is   of   a   volcanic nature, from the
base to the summit                of   these       mountains.          This black sand,
attracted      by      the magnet,           resembles       the ferruginous sand on
the shores        of Naples       ;    and these deep ravines, the           sections
of which show  the work of the fire, are similar to the rugged
face of Mount Somma hanging over the narrow valley which
separates   from the Vesuvius of the present day, where
               it
every    thing      also   is   the work          of fire.
  Bouguer had an opportunity of seeing closely the ravines
he mentions he traversed
                    :     great number of them in ascend
                                             a
ing from Caracol, situated at                     the foot     of the Cordelier,       to the
valley of Quito. The ascents   and descents were so frequent,
that    occupied him seven days in travelling
       it                                         distance of              a
only eight or nine leagues in   right line. He at last arrived
                                                  a
at the foot of that part of ChimboraQ0 which hangs over the
valley.     These numerous ravines, which furrow the declivity
of   the Cordelier from its base, hollowed out    the torrents            by
produced       the abundant rains which fall in this country,
                  by
show  that the  substances of which these declivities are formed
are quite distinct from each other, like all the heaps of vol
canic matters.

       New Observations on Volcanoes and their Lavas.            223
   The academicians measured in this high region three de
grees of the meridian, from Cuenca on the south to the
equinoctial line to the north of Quito, not far from the grand
volcano of Cayambairo.        This valley being bordered on both
sides, through all its length, with very high volcanoes, its
soil must be composed entirely of an accumulation of the
substances    they have vomited     ;  they have heaped       up the
space which originally     separated the two lines    of  %'olcanocs,
and raised the valley to its present height.         It is not asto
nishing that M. Humboldt did not find any slate, micaceous
schistus, gneiss, or any vestige of granite; but what is particu
larly astonishing is, as he says, that granite always occupies
the highest parts   of the globe in the temperate zones. It is
not, therefore, at all ascertained that in this part of the Cor
delier, 'every thing being the work of subterraneous fires,
there is any bed of natural rocks. This is probably the reason
why he had recourse to porphyry, from the porphyroidab
appearance of several lavas.      Such are the errors into which
we may fall, when we adopt the Neptunian           system, in mis
taking the productions of fire.
   Beyond the two lines of volcanoes their sides are joined
by the successive extension of their bases, and show a suc
cession   of  heaps  of the  same matter   : this is pointed out in
a very precise manner by the observations of the academi
cian.    These exterior shelves being very old, and descend
ing into   the region  of vegetation, they are covered with herbs
and forests    wherever the torrents have not torn up ravines.
The base of Mount ./Etna is also covered with forests, and
that of Vesuvius with gardens and vineyards, which are often
destroyed by new eruptions.           Perhaps one     of the layers
through which the volcano          of the Cordelier     shows itself
appears at the exterior    : their numerous eruptions may have
covered   them.     The foot of the cones which rise from the
valley ought not to be considered as the base of the volcano.
Their base is at the level of the sea, and the focus of the
crater is considerably below it.
   Bouguer, but slightly acquainted with volcanoes and vol
 canic matters, saw only, in the different beds of the -lavas
 and scoriae  of Cotopaxi, stones simply burned of various co-

   lours  ;  as the   academician of Naples, and father De la Torre,
   only saw      at Vesuvius     stones in a natural state, or simply
    roasted,   and calcined of different colours.        Thus we ought
    to regard the work of the French academician merely as a
   recital, which describes tolerably well the disorder and all the
   appearances observed in volcanic mountains.
       One incontestable       proof that the fires of the volcanoes
-  which range along the valley of Quito, Cuenpa, Riobamba,
   and Popayan, have their origin below the level of the sea,
   arises from      the  frequent and dreadful earthquakes felt on
   that coast    ; and they are    owing to the same cause which has
   raised all these volcanoes,       and which sometimes gives birth
   to new eruptions.          Unfortunately for the country, the in
   flammable substances which are the sources of all these
   disasters,     are not consumed      ; but when we reflect       upon
   what      has   happened     in former    times   in order to raise
   these enormous        and  numerous volcanoes, it is evident that
   the cause which produced them has much diminished.
       I have often had a strong desire to visit that country, the
   most interesting, perhaps, on the surface of the globe. When
   it shall   be explored by naturalists skilled      in the  knowledge
  of volcanoes       and volcanic productions,     they will,  I have no
  doubt, ascertain lliat the state of things is such as I have
  explained.        What still further explains why the French and
  Spanish travellers never found any marine fossil in this vast
  part of the Cordelier is, that, every thing there being the
  work of fire, there could not be any marine productions.
      The height of the peaks of volcanic mountains, which
  often surpasses that of the most elevated of other chains of
  mountains,        ought not to be considered as a monument of
  the height at which the sea has been, each of them having
  been elevated to this point, since its retreat, by the accumu
  lation of the substances which had issued from the volcano.
  We cannot, even doubt that these enormous volcanoes had.
  been manifested under the waters          of the old sea.
       Ulloa, in his sixteenth discourse, which treats of the fossils
  and petrifactions of Peru, concludes, from the marine pe-
  trifaotions of the high mountains of Guancavelica, that there
  ought to be the si$me productions in the other high moun
                                                                    tains

         New Observations on Volcanoes and their Lavas.             225
  tains of the country.      In common with other travellers, he
  has remarked that, the mountains of Guancavelica being ma
 rine productions, there were sea fossils in them ; but he has
 not remarked that, the Cordeliers of the Andes            being com
 posed   of volcanoes,    several of  which are still burning, there
 could not be any marine deposit there.              It would be very
 interesting to know the limits of these two classes of moun
 tains, so different from each other         ;  in what place the one
 finishes and the other begins, and in what manner they join.
 We may conjecture, with good reason, that the volcanic
 theory will maintain itself against the Neptunian.
     An opinion which I constantly maintained with M. Do-
 lomieu,    and some other naturalists,      viz.  that basahes are  of
 volcanic production, is confirmed, in the most distinct man
 ner, by the observations made by M. Daubuisson in Au-
 vergne. Thus, what I said at the conclusion of my Ob
 servations upon Basaltes is completely verified : " The time
 will come when naturalists belonging to the Neptunian
 theory will no longer dispute the volcanic origin of basaltes;
 for, the more inquirers there are, the more observations are
 multiplied,    and in different places,  the more shall we acquire
a demonstration       that basaltes are    a   production of fire." —
Journal    de Physique,     cahier de Fructidor, an. 9.
     Mr. Kirwan, as a proof that basahes are of sea origin, has
 instanced some basaltes which contain marine shells.            I was
 persuaded   that this was a mistake, and I said so in the ob
 servations   I  made  on the subject: since that time my con
jecture has been completely verified.
     I have seen some pieces of this stone, said to be basaltcs,
 containing shells, brought from Ireland by professor Pictet.
This stone is not basaltic. It is disposed in horizontal layers
 on the sea coast in the county of Antrim ; and the true ba
 saltes have nothing     in common     with    it except the colour,
 which is nearly similar.       The shells it contains are those of
ammons; a kind of shell unknown             in animated nature, and
 which is found only in the argillaceous or calcareous          depo
 sits of the antient sea.
     There is this important geological fact shown by volcanic
 mountains, — that they have been much more numerous for-

merly than they are at present. The surface of our conti
nent is covered with them in various places. The peninsula
of Italy,   and the' neighbouring islands, show a very great
number of them, four of which only are still burning, and
they are the only volcanoes in activity in a circumference of
6 or 700 leagues, although there must have been plenty of
them in the countries and seas comprised in this space. This
fact is so well known       at present   that  I shall cite only one
example, taken from the Travels           of M. Horneman in the
North of Africa.
   He remarked in his route       between   Audjela   and  Moursouk
several mountains       with all the characteristics  of antieut vol
canoes.    This class of mountains was little known to biro,
and his recital, therefore, wants precision ; but his language
admits of no doubt. There are, he says, many chains of
black and steril mountains.          He remarked one which had
the form   of  a  truncated cone.      He  saw basaltes, stones    of
a red   colour like bricks, porous and spongy stones resem
bling  the scoriae   of metals, dull and heavy stones, and others
full of holes and cavities; characters which cannot be
mistaken    for any      thing else than volcanic productions.
M.   Horneman       also  learned at Moursouk, that there were
black mountains        upon the route leading from this city to
Bornon towards the south-east.
   The Lesser Antilles, the Mariannes, the Aleoutes between
Kamtschatka and America, the Fero Islands, and the nu
merous islands of the South Sea, are all volcanic produc
tions, and   a  few among them are still burning.
   This is one of the many proofs that the causes which have
produced the chancres upon our globe have much diminished,
and that it constantly tends to a more stable and fixed state.
Tor although     the volcanic mountains       of the interior of the
earth have only burned under the        water of the antient sea, and
it may be possible that some of them would have experienced
eruptions if the sea again washed them ; it is without doubt,
from the numerous examples afforded by the seas of the pre
sent day, that a great number burn no longer after the sea
has withdrawn.
   When     M. Dolomicu,        who has so well described several
                                                             volcanic

yLi!i>>. that   volcanoes have performed too important a pare in
the antient history of our globe not to interest every natu
ralist,   he is perfectly       right ; but when he adds, that vol
canoes have also contributed much to the formation of our
continents and mountams, he attributes an effect to them
with which they have             had nothing to do.            The   beds   of our
continents and our mountains existed                   before the volcanoes,
as every phenomenon              shows.      The volcanoes          have   broken
out through beds already formed, and have raised up moun
tains very different from those which owe their origin (o the
deposits of the sea. The latter are primary formations, and
the work of water ; volcanoes are posterior formations, and
the products      of fire.
XXXVIII.          Some      Particulars respecting the Geography,
      Natural Productions, and History of the Crimea*.
JV1. REUILLY first describes, in               a  sort  of introduction,        the
route he pursued on his way to the Crimea.                            He set out
from Petersburg!! in February 1803, and directed his course
along the Odessa.            In order to arrive at the Odessa he tra
versed     what is called Steps, wild and uncultivated, where
neither trees nor shrubs are to be seen.                   The small number
of inhabitants which live in                these Steps consists        of exiles
and deserters      from different governments, but travelling is
nevertheless      secure.       Before reaching Nicilaief he fell in
with    the river Bug,       the environs      of which, below         the town,
are remarkable        for vestiges      of Grecian antiquities.              Being
arrived at Cherson,            he   passed    the"Litt!e Ingoul,          then    at
some     distance the Nieper, whence the route leads to Ni>-
gais Tartary, an immense plain, often totally obscured by
whirlwinds of sand, from which it is asserted that the
Nogais Tartars defend themselves by wearing goggles.
    The work is divided into two                 parts.     The first contains
the physical or geological state of             the Crimea,        the peninsula

228        Some    Particulars    respecting  the Geography,
formerly known by the name of Taurica Chersonesus, and
so celebrated in antiquity.        Its modern name is derived from
a small town called Krim.              But since it lias belonged to
Russia it has resumed       its antient name     of Tauride.
    M. de Reuilly, after having given the geographical situa
tion of this country, develops its general aspect, describes
its mountains,      their structure, and the mines they contain.
The most     elevated   point or ground in the whole Crimea is
the mountain       called by the Tartars Tchatyr-Dagh (Tent
Mountain), which         the author thinks was the Trapezzos of
the Greeks.      It is about IOOO teet above the level of the sea.
    The southern part of the Crimea presents the highest
mountains, which extend from Caffa to Balaclara.                Follow
ing the eastern side     of  the mountain    of  Karadagh he reached
the valley of Kooz, which takes its name from a populous
village;   the road which leads to it is strewed here and there
•with ores   of iron.    In   the neighbourhood are found quarries
of free-stone, with which         the inhabitants build their houses
and the enclosures of their vineyards.             Immediately after
wards the mountain Bouiouk Sirt presents itself; from
\vhenceheproceeded          to the village of Joklouk; and a little
afterwards to the valley of Soudagh, renowned for its excel
lent wine.      Soldata was       the next   place   he visited, where
there was an antient Genoese fortress, enclosed              by a   thick
wall furnished with towers.           Within   these few years several
ruined buildings in the Gothic style were to be seen; but
nothing now remains in the eastern part of the city, except
 the grand and beautiful cathedral church, and the lowers and
walls of the place. Near Koutlak, where he arrived by fol
lowing the course of the Karagatch, there is a quarry, which
lies very high, and is very difficult to be wrought.            The in
habitants roll down large blocks of it shaped into mill-stones,
 and which are used in almost all the mills of the Crimea.
 The Tartars of      the village   of Kapsokhor,     besides their gar
 dens and vineyards,      have    upon the shores of the -sea fine
 fields of cucumbers        and lint, which they cultivate with
 very great    care.    From     thence   he  proceeded    to Ouskot     :
 half way on, upon          a   very high promontory,        is  an   an
 tient Grecian      tower,    very well preserved,       to which     the
                                                                 Tartars

           Natural Productions, and History of the Crimea.              229
   Tartars have given the name          of Ichoban-Kale (Shepherd's
   Fort).    Ouskot,    a  populous village, is not very far from
   Touiak, situated       in a warm and agreeable valley, al
  most entirely      planted with lint.       A  little    distance from
   Kourou-Ozen       is the  valley of Alouchla, which            separates
   the eastern part of the high mountains we             have   just men
   tioned from the western part we are about            to   explore with
   our traveller. Alchouta, an episcopal see,           is the first place
   which presents itself.       This city, placed       on an isolated
v
  situation,    contains   a considerable population.          Vestiges of
  an old Greek fortification are seen there.            The habitations
  of the Tartars of this region, built upon      the declivities     of the
   hills, are low, and covered with earth.        "   They have more
   over a custom of building their houses against the rugged
   shelves of the mountains.         The front wall is composed of
  rude stones, and the roof is      a  platform of earth which serves
  them to walk upon, and on which they lie in summer time.
  The inside has a large fire-place, with a wide chimney.
  Coarse carpets, of woollen cloth, and some cushions are
  their only moveablcs."         The buffalo is the only domestic
  animal of these Tartars,      \\!io employ it in labour.         In front
 of the village of Koutchouk-Lambat, which has a line har
  bour, is seen the Ayou-dagh (or Mountain of the Bears), and
  near it is the village of Parthenit, almost entirely inhabited
 by Greeks.       The valley into which it stretches is intersected
  by a great number of springs, and embellished by numerous
  gardens.      Near the hamlet of Kourkoulet, at which he
  arrived by mounting an almost inaccessible rock wiih a
  double summit, are to be seen the remains of Genoese forti
  fications.     Behind the promontory of Nikita are some vil
  lages, among which are Magaratch and JVIarsenda, formerly
  inhabited by emigrant Greeks from Mariopolis.                   Between
  these two last villages there is a chapd in ruins, shaded by
  old walnut-trees, and under which a rivulet takes its source.
  A   wooden cup, constantly placed upon a piece of the rock^
  serves to allay the thirst    of travellers, who respect this rude
  but benevolent mark of Tartar hospitality.             From Dertkoi,
   the environs   of which    present a copious and       beautiful moss
   to botanists,   he descended      into the superb valley of Yalta.

230       Some   Particulars respecting Ike Geography,
The city of the      same name, formerly      occupied by Greeks,
is at present inhabited by a small number          of Tartars ; it has
a safe roadstead.        Near Aotitka, inhabited by Greeks who
live chiefly by the oyster fishery, the cascades          of Akar-sou
are seen,    the fall  of which is 60 toises. Soon after quitting
Goshra, Charis and Mouskor, and a little before coming to
Aloupka, the scene changes, and presents a very savage
aspect. But the traveller is sometimes astonished by meet
ing with a village, gardens, and even cultivated grounds in
the middle of enormous masses of rocks heaped upon each
other.    The winter of 1 802 produced the most frightful
ravages in this district; only one laurel-tree escaped.           Upon
this occasion,    as   M. Reuilly informs us, the Tartars       derived
from the Greeks and appropriated to their own language the
word Daphne. in order to express the laurel. This valley,
one of the warmest of all the southern part, is every where
surrounded      by    the famous    Kriou-Metopon,         the   Ram's
Head,    a mountain      well known to the navigators       of .antient
Greece.
   After having passed successively Cape Crotis Bouron, the
valley of Simcus, extremely rich in fruit-trees, and the pro
montory of Limanes, the village of Koutchoukoy presents
itself in view, near which lies the scene of the revolution of
 1784, described by M. Pallas.           He afterwards traversed
Pchatka and Foros, which lead to the smiling valley of
Baidair,   separated by a very      high rock from that of Var-
moutka.       After  some    hours journey he reached Balaclava,
where ends the chain of the high mountains of the Southern
Crimea.
   In spite of the assertion of some writers, the Crimea con
tains no volcanic fires ; an opinion so much the more pro
bable because earthquakes are very infrequent.               There arc
much more frequently falling of rocks and watery eruptions
between Kertch and Ycuikalc; but particularly in the island
of Taman.
   Several   rivers water the Crimea     ;  some    of  them flow to
wards the north-east into the sea       of Sivach, and others run
westward to the Black Sea.             Among    the   former are the
Salghir,    into   which    the  great  and   little   Cara-sou     and
                                                            Bouroultz

        Natural Productions, and History of the Crimea.        431
Bourcniltz    empty themselves   ; the Souya,   the three Indals
or Andales, the Soubacke and the eastern Boulgonak.
Among the latter the most considerable are the Alma, the
Catcha, the Belbek and the Cobarda.          The waters of these
different rivers are in general pure, agreeable, and contain
no noxious qualities. The most salubrious are in the cantons
of Koslof and Kertch.
   The salt lakes form the principal riches of the Crimea ;
those of Perecope are regarded as the most important, parti- „
culdrly those known by the names of Staroe-Ozero, (Old
Lake) and Krasnoi-Ozero (Red Lake).
   There are no considerable forests. The trees and shrubs
are nearly the same as in Europe.
   The soil of the Crimea is rich in pot-herbs,          medicinal
plants,   and   many others proper for dyeing and tanning.
Wheat is every where cultivated, as also rye, barley, oats,
millet and maze, without mentioning an infinity of useful
or agreeable objects appropriated to the different places,
such as lint, madder, agnus castus, shumac, turpentine,
&c. Sec. There are only two chestnut-trees in the whole
Crimea, which are to be seen near Derekoi.
    The animal kingdom is not very populous in this country,
and    consequently presents little variety.    Among the do
mestic animals, we distinguish a race of greyhounds, in great
estimation for hunting. M. de Reuilly received one of very
great beauty, as a present, which he brought to France.
The birds of the Crimea present nothing remarkable or rare ;
the same may be said of the fish also, with which the seas
abound.      One fish peculiar to the Black Sea, and the sea     of
Azof, is    a kind of turbot of a large size.
    Reptiles are very rare in the Crimea, and there is not a
great variety of insects ; the bee itself has been only in
 creased  in consequence of unwearied exertions.        One of the
 plagues,   which  this  country   shares in common    with  a part
of Africa and Asia, is the locust. It is besides subjected to
the ravages of a small grasshopper with red wings, which
has made its appearance within these few years.
    As to the temperature, it    is extremely variable.     Never
 theless  the air is pure and healthy,     but autumn brings on
                                                          remittent

 *32       Some       Particulars respecting I he Geography,
 remittent and intermittent fevers. There is no nation what
 ever, which has not its method of dividing the seasons : the
 following is the one in use among the Tartars. The spring,
 Bahaar, commences on the 23d of February, and lasts 6o
 days, to the 22d of June.       The summer, Tochilla, is 40
 days, which finishes on the 1st of August. This month does
not form part of any season, and is called down to the 25lh
Agostos.  The 26th of August begins their autumn, Ghous,
composed       of     61   days, and   which    ends   on the 26th          of
October.       It   is at this period that the Tartars conclude their
bargains and renew their leases. The 36 following days are
the precursors of their grand winter, Kychtchllla, which
begins on the 1st of December, lasts 66 days, and finishes
only on the 4th of February.     They give the name of
Goud Chouk-ai to the 24 remaining days of this month.
The 53 following days, from the 1st of March to the 23d of
April, they call Mars, and they form no part of any season.
We remark in this last period, according to the meteorolo
gical observations of the Tartars, three distinct cold epochs,
which they name, the winter nf old women ; the winter of
the blackbirds  (berdal asher], which lasts seven or eight
days; and lastly, the winter of the lapwings (afwfjfo).
  We now come to the second part of these Travels, which
is dedicated     to the political state,  or rather to the history of
the Crimea,         or the Antient Tauridis.    In this country, like
all others, it is difficult,not to say impossible, to tell who
were the first inhabitants.    Some maintain that they were
the Taurians, aborigines of the mountainous part ; others
have found       Amazons       there   1700    years   before our       aera ;
lastly others, and these are the most numerous, mention the
Cimmerians, or Cimbri, as the old masters of this immense
peninsula.   The latter, driven out by the Scythians, who
came from the north of Persia, retired to the mountains.
Six centuries before the Christian aera the Greeks established
themselves there, at' least on the shores of              it,
                                                  and built
Panticapeeum  or Bosphorus,  now  called Kertch; Theodosia,
now called Paffa;          and Cherson,    which   became       a   powerful
republic,  and upon which         the author has given some parti
cular details.       There are others who regard the invasion              of
                                                                     Darius

      Natural Productions, and History of the Crimea.             233
Darius  as the epoch of the establishment of foreign colonies
in the Crimea.       In the year 480 hefore the vulgar aera, the
Archoe-Anaktides, -aborigines of Mitylene, founded the
kingdom of Bosphorus, from which future sovereigns ex
tended their possessions. This country, successively under
the dominion of the Scythians. the Sarmatians and the
Taurians, was entirely conquered in the year before Christ
82, by Mithridates king of Pontus.             Sixteen years after
wards, the defeat of this prince placed the Crimea in the
hands of the Romans, who left Pharnaces, the rebel son of
Mithridates, on the throne of Bosphorus.                 In the first
century of our aera it was invaded by the Alains, who were
supplanted in their turn by the Scythians, then known by
the name    of Goths.       These having been conquered by the
Huns, formed      a  distinct state in the mountains of Kertch,
the kings whereof were Christians.            We may observe, by
the way, that Christianity was received in the Crimea under
Dioclcsian    and   Constantin.     At length,    at the end   of  the
4th century, the kingdom of Bosphorus disappeared, and
about the beginning of the 5th the power of the Huns was
annihilated by the Hungarians, who took possession of the
southern coast, and their descendants wandered a long time
by the name of JRoultziagres and Oultzaingoures, and were
in 679 subjugated by the Chazares, to whom the mountain
Goths and those of the Greek cities also became tri
butary.     14 840 the       emperor Theophilus, as sovereign,
erected a province under the name of Cherson.                 At this
epoch   the  Jews    became    very   numerous    in  that  province.
After a variety of revolutions the Crimea came into the
hands of the Genoese.          About    J 204  the soudagh or so
vereign of the Crimea renounced his allegiance to the throne
of Constantinople.        In short, after having     been alternately
in the possession of the Genoese, the Venetians and the
Turks, the Crimea was finally wrested from the latter by
the Russians in       1783,   after  a  war which     had lasted    46
years.
   M.  de  Reuilly afterwards     develops  the state  of the Crimea
under the different governments, and particularly under the
Khans and the Russians.           He describes the physiognomy,
                                                                   the

 the character, and the manners of its inhabitants, divided
 into Tartars of the mountains and Tartars of the plain ; and
 describes the kind of industry and commerce peculiar to
 each. He also points out certain improvements proper for
 opening new sources of riches.           His critical glance at the
 commerce of the Black Sea is full of just observations. The
 author seems to have had it in view to prove, how advan
 tageous   it would be to France to form entrepots of com
 merce in these regions ; he also suggests the means of doing
 away the obstacles which have hitherto retarded the pro
sperity   of  the French   trade  in  the' Crimea.       Notes 0H the
principal trading ports of this peninsula are also given, con
taining curious details upon Odessa, Nicolaief, Cherson,
CafFa and Taganrok.       Koslof or Goesleve, aud Sebastapol
have not been forgotten in this work.
    Anxious to omit nothing which might add any interest to
his work, M. Reuilly has enriched it with drawings of the
coins of the Crimea and designs of medals, almost wholly
unknown, which he collected in his journey- They are
accompanied by notices from Messrs. Langles and               Milliu.

       DEAR SIR,                  No. l,Hin<Ic-street, M^che-iter-square.
ATTENDING        the wife  of Mr. Parkes,         a practical chemist,
the   well-known author of " The Chemical Catechism," a
work of considerable reputation, I recommended to her the
inhalation of vital air, which was fabricated by his foreman,
Mr. Williams, of Tyson-street, who had been afflicted with
asthma upwards of 15 years.          Many nights together he was
unable to lie in his bed; and Mr. Parkes finding that his wife
was much restored in her health by the pneumatic practice,
he advised Mr. Williams to consult me on his case.              As this
is very well drawn up by the patient,        I  shall enclose it.
             A  Case of Asthma cured       by  Vital Air.
    " When about twelve        years  old    I  was taken with         an

from four to five days, during which time I could not lie
down in my bed, nor obtain any rest, being in the greatest
agony, supposing every breath to be my last, and often
wishing it to be so. These fits came on about once a fort
night, and oftener if I did not take the greatest care. My
father consulted    a great number of medical gentlemen, as
doctors Lyde, Jones, Exton, Wainright, &c. (in the neigh
bourhood where     I  was born) of great repute, who lived in
the Hay, Breconshire, and in Hereford and Monmouth;
but  I was given up by them all, as incurable. After this I had
recourse to various patent medicines, but all to no purpose.
A relation residing in London advised me to come to town,
where   I should certainly get some relief. I resolved to come,
bad as I was, and resided at his house, when his physician
attended me, and to my great grief told me, the grave would
shortly be my portion, if I did not immediately return into
the country.     Distressing   now     was my situation,    having
had the asthma on me fifteen years, being 27 years         of age,
and three years in London ; when fortunately for me I tried
the vital air, under Dr. Thornton, who ordered me to in
hale daily one gallon of vital air diluted, aided by other
usual medicines, and in a few days I found myself greatly re
lieved ; and in a few weeks quite well.          1 have been free
from asthma upwards of two years."
                           ObservatiaitS.
    1. The  dose of vital air employed was     a gallon a day, di
luted with atmospheric air four times that quantity.
   2. The medicines were of the tonic kind, as mentioned
often in the relation of othtr cases.
   3. As the learned Dr. Pitcairn, whose liberality is well
known, asked me when I was under examination before the
Royal London College of Physicians, the proportion of vital
air in the blood under certain morbid conditions, is it not
certain, that the aerial practice begins to make some im
pression on veterans of our profession, so much more liberal
are the faculty now, than in the days      of Harvey P
   4. After so many physicians         were baffled in their at

halation of vital air proving so quickly salutary, and the
benefit continuing, demand some more attention than is
usually given to this subject by juniors in the profession I
    5. The expense attending the application of the air amounts
only to one shilling per diem       :  hence this application comes,
within   the reach   of every person.

exposure to the inclemency of the weather. He was con
fined from accidental injury, by which an abscess on the
leg was produced, from which he appeared to be recover
ing ; when the cough and expectoration, to which he had
been    subject many years, suddenly left him, difficulty of
breathing ensued, with pain in the chest : neither did blis
ters, expectorants, or diaphoretics, appear to produce the
least effect, and he died within 48 hours from the accession
 of  the first unfavourable symptom.
    The importance and utility of the industrious poor          to a
civilized    and commercial    state  are indisputable ; their ser
vices have been for ages past acknowledged, and will con
 tinue to be so by generations yet to come. Surely, then,
gratitude must confess that they claim the attentive regard,
 and that they are entitled under infirmities to the charitable
 assistance, of a generous and benevolent public.
    Experience shows that near one-tenth part of mankind
 are afflicted with hernia   ! How many of those persons are
 there   necessarily engaged    in laborious pursuits to earn a
 scanty sustenance for themselves and families, without the
 possibility of providing even the necessary clothing to de
 fend their bodies from the inclemencies         of the weather, to
 which they are daily exposed !
    View them the subjects of this malady,           a disease of all
 others,    perhaps, the most insidious, and tending to the
 greatest danger ; being in many instances, at its commence
 ment, unattended with pain, or further inconvenience than
 that which arises from the increased size of the part, which
 is easily reduced by placing the body in a horizontal posi
 tion. Circumstances may continue in this state for an in
 definite length of time, which no human wisdom can fore
 see: the unhappy sufferers are seized with inflammation in
 the part, when, from their ignorance of the symptoms and
 danger of the complaint, they allow much time to elapse
 before surgical assistance is called.     In this metropolis the
 first application   is  frequently  made   to dispensaries; when
 behold distress in every countenance ! the parent confined
 on a sick bed, the scanty sustenance of the family ceases
                                                                with

with    the labour     of the father, or their domestic convenience*
cease to be attended        to with the advancing disease of the mo
ther ! In this state of things it too frequently happens that
an operation is the only resource left, by which even a chance
of recovery      ean be afforded to the afflicted ; and that            to be
performed        under circumstances        of all others the most di
 stressing, a want        of the common necessaries of life com
bined     with   disease.
    The removal of the diseased to an hospital is attended
with increasing danger in a ratio with the delay it produces,
and also as it operates on the minds of the sufferers, who are
about to exchange every thing that is near and dear to them,
in the very hour of danger and distress,                to seek an asylum
among strangers, at which the human mind recoils, be the
advantages what they may.              Here the dispensaries, from the
daily and ready access which the poor have to them, are
paramount to all other institutions.
    These distressing scenes, which too frequently occur, and
in many instances end in leaving a disconsolate widow with
a helpless offspring         burthensome to the parish, might ge
nerally be prevented         by a proper bandage or truss applied in
the beginning of the disease, and continued with care. This
might be accomplished at a small expense compared with
the good that would accrue to society ; it would even be a
saving to the community at large, by the prevention of ac
cidents which always tend to increase the parochial rates.
    The funds required to carry this plan into execution                  are
very small,      as three trusses   may be provided for each guinea
subscribed,       no other expense being necessary               :  the great
object    to  be  kept in view is the easy access-, by           which every
diseased applicant may obtain a ready atul permanent relief.

TT    GENTLEMEN,
.Having,     during the  last thirteen yelrs, carefully attended
to the cultivation of a breed of sheep, for the wool of which,
in various forms,             the society has done me the honour to award
tne several premiums, I think myself called on to communi
cate to them the general resul of my experience.     This                                           I
shall do in form of propositions, each of which ! shall at
tempt to demonstrate by specimens now exhibited to the
society.
  I must premise that, except a few Morfe ewes, which I
employed at the commencement of my experiments, but
which I soon thought I had good reasons for discarding, my
ewes were           wholly of
                         Ryeland breed, selected for me itt
                                      the
Herefordshire, and altogether uncontaminated by the ad
mixture of any of the larger and r:0re fashionable kinds.
The rams which I have emploved for the original crosses
have been           Merinos, from                the flocks         of   the   King      and   lord
Somerville.            Of     these rams           I have,         at different times,         used
about tetii
   I. The first proposition which I shall endeavour                                       to esta
blish,    that the wool of the fourth cross of this
           is,                                                                            breed   is
fully    equal        in    fineness      to that        of    the male parent stock              in
England.
  In order to prove this>                   I /    refer to the scoured specimens,
Numbers          and 4.
                 1,   2,    3,
  No.     1    is   the entire fleece            of   a   Merino ram, given                 by   the
King     to the late marquis                of Bath.          Tt   is   divided into R. F.        T.
and     K.f
  No.      2     is   a     fleece,    similarly          divided,        of   a   ram    of     the
Merino-Ryeland                   breed,     immediately              descended        from       the
former.
  No;     3    is   the R. wool           of   a   ewe    of      the same cross.

Vol.     27.   No.         107.   April      1807.                       Q_                 No.   4

240                           On improved Sheep
    No.    4  is  a very small portion from another ram of the
same cross.          I am extremely concerned that, by some aCr
cident, I should have mislaid this entire fleece ; but this
specimen, together with numbers 2 and 3. certainly proves
the proposition, that wool of the fourth cross may become
 at least equal to that         of  the original Spaniard.
    This proposition will admit of further confirmation, by
taking into the comparison the scoured fleece, No. 5, which
is that of the Spanish ram last presented by the King to this
society.
    I  may add, that, except by accident, the wool of no
dip, short of the fourth, equals in fineness that of Spain.
    II. By breeding from select Merino-Ryeland rams and
ewes    of this stock,          sheep   may be obtained, the fleeces of
which are superior both to those of the cross-bred parents,
and of course to those of the original progenitors of the pure
                                              *
Merino blood in England.
    For the truth of this proposition, I refer to Nos. 6 and 7,
the fleeces of rams, the sons of the 2tIer'mo-Ryeland ram,
No. 4, who is the son of the pure Spaniard, No. 1. These
fleeces are evidently much              finer than either     of  the former,
and,    I   verily believe,      than any ram's fleeces ever exhibited
in this island. I have unfortunately omitted                      to save the
fleeces of the parent ewes, but I can positively                    assert that
they were not superior to the ewe's fleece,                No.   3.
    The ram's        fleece,   No. 8,     is also of  an excellent quality.
He is brother         to   Nos. 6 and     7.
    I beg that the committee would                examine not only the R.
wool, but also the'F.              T. and    K. of  the specimens,      Nos.   6
and    7,    comparatively with those of the pure Spaniards,
Nos.     1  and 5.        I believe they will agree with me, that live
second, or F. wool,             of  these fleeces,   is at least equal to the
II.  or best wool of the pure Spaniards ; and the fleeces taken
together are finer than those of Nos. 2, 3, and 4, the
Mcrino-Ryeland              race   from    which   they    immediately      de
scended.
    This position        I  have, from accident, been able to establish
on   a large     scale.      Having no Spanish ram in the year 1801,
I   put all iny breeding ewes to the Merino-Ryeland ram,
                                                                       No. 4,

                      .    by the Spanish      Mixture.                     241
No> 4, above specified.            From this impregnation sprung the
rams Nos. 6, 7, and 8, already referred to, and my finest-
woolltd     ewes.       In  1802,   I ignorantly        hoped to improve my
wool by one dip more of the Spaniard.                       Accordingly, one
hundred of my best ewes were served by three pure Merinos.
The consequence was, that the entire produce was con
siderably coarser than that of the former generation.                       The
fleece,  No.    9, is that    of  a  rain, and is the very finest of this
whole dip.         The society need not be informed how much
inferior it is to Nos. 6 and 7-
   What comparison the produce of these mixed rams with,
unmixed English ewes will bear with those descended from
pure English ewes crossed with the pure Merino, 1 cannot
from my own experience              demonstrate.           All however which
I know       tends     to prove    them    in no respect inferior; and          I
have the evidence of a breeder of South-Down sheep in
Surry, whose letter to me \ am ready to produce, if required,
and who has this year employed these rams tg upwards of
six hundred ewes,            to show     that their lambs,        both in wool
attd carcase,       are superior to those           from pure Merinos.          I
need not point out to ihe society the important consequences
 which result from this fact.
    III. From mixed rams of this breed,                    sheep   may be ob
tained having wool             at least equal        in fineness   to the best
which can be procured from Spain.
   In order to ascertain this point,              I   request   the committee
to examine Nos. 10, 11,              12, and 13, scoured          specimens   of
Spanish wool.
   No.     10  is-df    the   N. E. or nigrette pile, for which          a ma
nufacturer        in a neighbouring          county, deservedly         of the
highest      reputation,       lately gave,      in     the  unscoured    state,
6s. gd. per     lb.      This specimen      is peculiarly interesting,       be
cause   it  is from that Spanish flock which furnished the                 Me-
tino   sheep now in possession           of   the    King,    and from which
are descended        most    of our mixed      races.
   No.    1 1,   is the Tores Paular, a pile           of great note.
   No.     12,   is from the Imperial        pile.
   No.     13, the finest      of all, is   the     Lastiri pile; for which,
 unsecured, the gentleman who favoured                    me with this speci-
                                        Q^.2                               men

 242                     On improved Sheep                    •
 men gave, nearly a year ago, 6s. 9d. a Ib. Of course, when
 scoured, it was then worth 7s. 9-J-d. per Ib.; and I believe it
 could not now be obtained without a considerable advance of
 price.   This  is the finest specimen        of Spanish wool which          I
 have been able to procure during the last twelve years ; but                I
 do not   think it   equal   to that    of my ram's        fleeces,  Nos.    6
 and 7.
    In comparing many of my               fleeces with the imported
 Spanish wool of these      most    vaunted   piles, there is one differ
 ence which will surely strike the most unskilful observer —
that while the latter is dry, and harsh, and intractable, mine
 is to the touch soft, flexible, and silky.
    IV. Wool from sheep of a proper modification of Merino
 and Ryeland, will make cloth equal to that from the Spanish
 wool imported into this country.
    This proposition I prove by reference to No. 14, which is
a piece    of navy-blue       broad-cloth, manufactured by Mr.
Naish, of Twerton.           I  refer also to a piece of black cassi-
mere,    No.  15, made chiefly from ram's wool,                by the same
gentleman.
    Whatever    merit there       may be in these articles, I will
hereafter assign sufficient reasons why they are by no means
equal to what may be expected from my flock at a future
period.
    V. The proportion of       fine wool in the fleeces        of this cross
breed is equal,    if not superior,       to that    of  the best Spanish
piles.
    In what is called   a  pile of Spanish wool, the R, or Refina
is as 20, the F. or Fina, 4, -and the T. or Tercera, 1 : that
is, the F. and T. are equal to one-fourth of the R. or one-
fifth of the whole    ;  the   F. one-fifth of       the   R.   and the   T.
one-twentieth.      In  the   blue cloth, No.       14,   above specified,
the R. was 44lb. the      F. 7-J-lb. and the T. 2J Ib. According
to the above proportion of the Spanish, the F. and T. of
this wool should have been lllb.; whereas they were only
9£lb.    This difference of IJ-lb.       is in  the   F. wool, which       is
so much    less than in the       pure   Spanish.       I beg the com
mittee to examine and express          their opinion whether this F.
       of my flock,   bag   No.     16, is not superior in quality to
                                                                       what

                          by the Spanish          Mixture.                      243
what is usually imported from Spain.      I am told that theT.
wool,  bag No.  ^7,  is entitled to the same comparative pre
ference.
     VI. This wool is more profitable in the manufacture than
the best Spanish.
   It requires 60 Ib. of good Spanish wool, in the imported
state,     to make thirty yards         of   broad cloth,     dyed in the woo!
of       the proper substance.       These 60 Ib. waste, in scouring,
to52lb.           Hence it follows,    that 52lb. of scoured Spanish
wool are necessary            to make thirty yards of good wool-dyed
broad-cloth.   The R. wool                   of the British cloth, No.           14,
having been 44 Ib. should therefore have made about 25J-
yards ; whereas, in fact, it made 26f yards ; and it is asserted
by the manufacturer, that if it had not deceived him as to its
capacity  of milling, to which is owing its uncommon
strength, it would have reached in length one yard and a
half more of cloth of the usual substance.     This account
corresponds  with that of Mr. Waldron's prize cloth from my
wool in the year 1602.    The R. wool dyed and picked blue
was 47 Ib. which might probably have been 48 Ib. when only
scoured. Now 48 Ib. of scoured Spanish wool should make
about 274 yards of broad-cloth ; whereas the same quantity
of my wool, in this instance, produced 30-i- yards of cloth ;
which the draper, even at that time, soUl for 23s. a yard.
  From these and many other similar facts which I could
adduce,       I     think myself authorized to infer, that this wool
wastes       less    in the manufacture, and is, therefore, weight
for weight, more valuable, than imported Spanish wool.
   For this difference very satisfactory reasons might be
given ; but 1 shall not 'take up the society's time with
enumerating           them.     It   is sufficient   for me to state, and,         I
think,      to have proved       the fact.
     I   have spoken above as to the superior softness and flexi
bility of this wool.            It   is probable that        several   gentlemen
are here present, who, in manufacturing                  it,   have found even
the coarser samples           to make much finer cloth than their ap
pearance       in the wool promised.              Further evidence      as to   this
point will be adduced under the next proposition.
  As to its capacity of felting, need go no further for proof
                                             I
                                         Q.   3                                 than

 344                      On improved Sheep
 than the blue cloth,      No.   14, in which,    as hath been before
 observed      under this head, it turned out greater than was
 justified by the common experience of Spanish wool.
      VII. The lambs' wool of the Merino-Ryeland breed
  will make finer cloth than      the best  of that of  the pure   Me
 rino breed.
      In order   to demonstrate this,   I  beg leave to exhibit   three
 pieces of lambs' wool broad-cloth.
     The black, No. 18, is the produce of my lambs of 1301,
 descended from the Spanish ram, No. 1.
     The lighter blue, N». 19, dyed in the piece, from the
 lambs of 1S03, got by pure Spanish rams.
     The darker blue, No. 20, from the lambs of the present
 year, most of which were got by the Merino-Ryeland ram,
 No. 4.
    The superior firmness of the cloth, No. 20, to that of
 No. 19, is a convincing proof of the truth of the second
 proposition.       At the same time, I beg leave to ask whether
 any gentleman here present has ever seen any cloth from
imported Spanish lambs' wool, equal to this in fineness and
 softness.      Thus  is established the truth not only    of this  7th
 proposition, but also of the 6th.
    I do not however exhibit this cloth       as the best which may
be produced from the lambs           of this cross.    The wool was
 not uniformly good.         It was of all degrees of fineness from
that of specimen No. 21, to that of specimen No. 22.
    Hereafter I shall assign the reason of this inequality, which
it cannot be doubted that 1 shall be able to correct, should
it  be thought necessary.
    VIII.    Should    long wool of this degree of fineness be
wanted for shawls, or any manufactures, which cannot be
perfected     with   our common coarse long wools, the ram's
fleece    of  the cross breed, which is exhibited No. 23, will
prove that this can be effected       by allowing the fleece to     re
main on the animal unshorn for two years.
    I  beg leave here to trouble the society with a few remarks.
I  have    said that the cloths from sheep's and lambs' wool,
now     exhibited,   good as they certainly are, are still not the
best which are to be obtained from my flock.                It will be
                                                           reasonable

                           by the Spanish          Mirlvre.                            245
reasonable      to ask, why        I   do not exhibit those best          ?    I   answer,
Because     1   have not hitherto had a sufficient choice                     of   fleeces.
It   has already       been stated,        that,    till the fourth           cross, the
produce of Rycland ewes cannot be made to equal the Me
rino in fineness.  On this principle, any one, who will give
himself the time to calculate, will find that, beginning with
one thousand ewes of the English blood, he will be eight
years, unless his lambs take the ram, before he has one
hundred and twenty-five sheep of that fourth cross.  What
then must have bee\i the ease with me, wlio for some years
could not procure Spaniards to serve annually more than
from five to twelve ewes ? In fact, exclusively of the best
fleeces, always reserved for exhibition and comparison, I
have not hitherto been able to appropriate to the manufacture
of fine clofh more, in any one year, than about thirty-five
fleeces ; and      of    these    several     have been only         of       the second
rate.      Of this      class   I consideremployed for the
                                               the fleeces
cloths, and more especially the cassimere, 'now exhibited.
Having now much better rams, a further advance of time,
and more experience, I may reasonably hope to remedy this
deficiency.        It will not however             be   till   the ycar 1S09, which
is seventeen years from the commencement of my experi
ments, that I sh.ll expect to have a flock of four or five
hundred sheep, all equal in fineness of fleece to Nos. 6 or 7.
     Before I conclude,            I wish     lo call the attention of the
society to one more important point ; which is my
   IXth and last proposition ; that though I have never
selected a breeding ram or ewe on account of any other
quality than the fineness of the fleece, this stock is already
much improved as lo the form of its carcase, comparatively
with the Merinos originally imported.
   For this purpose, I exhibit three two-tooth rams, eight
ewes, two anil four-tooths,    and four chilver Iambs.   These
sheep  have  not been fed for exhibition.  All have eaten only
grass.     They have been constantly together in great num
bers; and notwithstanding   any want of merit as to hisih con
dition,    an inconvenience very easily remedied                      by those who
attach     importance to         it,    they will be found superior in car
case to most      oi    the pure       Merinos which have seen.1      think     I
                                          O   4                                       they

248                        Present State           of    the
they show that, by a proper selection, this breed may soon
become equal in carcase to the best South-Downs.     From
the size of the two-tooth rams, no one will hesitate to con
clude that wethers           of this breed,
                                    at two-shear, may easily
be made to reach     or 18lb. per quarter.
                          16
  I beg the society's pardon for having so long intruded
myself on their attention.  I shall probably give them little
trouble of this kind in future ; but as the subject, at this
time especially, is of great importance to the commercial
interests ot the country, I request that they would permit
the committee to examine the several propositions which I
have stated,and report on them, separately, at the general
meeting to morrow.

XLII.        Present State      of    the   Art    r,f   Painting   in   France.    By
  T. C. BRUNN NEERGAEKDT, MemLer                                  of   the French   In-
 -stitute*.
JL   ROFESSOR FIORIT.LO               published          at   Gottingen,   some time
ago, the third volume            of his History of the Art of Fainting,
which contains that            branch of the subject relating to France.
   The author says in his preface, that •' at first he only
thought of speaking of the old French school, and that                               it
was too soon to describe the modern one."         am not of his     I
opinion;    think
             I      that the modern    school has  already pro
duced, and     daily producing, artists of sufficient merit to
                 is
entitle them to be publicly noticed.      am also of opinion  I
that M. Fiorillo would have done well to have waited until
 *    From   a   memoir   entitled    "   Cumctiom jt Additions pnur u;i Ouvrogt dt
M. Fiorillo sur I'Art tie Dnsin en France depuis son Krtal-lasanmt jusqu'h          nos
Jours." Read at the French National Institute, May 11, 1806.
                                                                                    he

he had procured some more exact information,                or visited
France in person.
   I have not written the       following observations in the spirit
of a critic; it is the love of the arts and of truth which has
alone dictated them ; and I only furnish M. Fiorillo with
the present additional information, that he may be enabled,
in a second edition, to render his work more useful, by
making it more exact and more complete.
   The period which embraces the artists             of the modern
school,   will include    all   such, of any repute, as have died
since 1750.     I shall begin with Francesco Casanova, whom
I knew on my first visit to Vienna. Fiorillo says that he
was a pupil of Simonini, th:it he took Jacob Courtois for
his model, and that he studied Wouvermans : all this does
him honour; but I cannot coincide in the opinion of this
author   when    he   says,
                              "  that he (Casanova) was nothing
else, in the true sense     of   the word, than a plagiarist, who
sometimes took one groupe and sometimes another from
the works     of Bourguignon,        and placed it in his   own pic
tures."    In battle pieces, several things may resemble each
other, without our being entitled to say that one painter has
stolen from another.         People fight and are killed, in gene
ral, in the same manner.           Casanova was a man of genius,
and I think the accusation of our author is ill founded.            He
has said very little upon the talents and works of this artist;
who has, however, acquired a just reputation in France. He
has forgot his brother, who was director of the gallery at
Dresden ; and he has also omitted to mention several of his
scholars who are known in France.               Francesco Casanova,
in his latter years, did some small paintings of animals, of
an agreeable composition and of a light touch, for which
he was well paid.
   In delivering    the  eulogy which is due to the talents of
M. Vernet, he only quotes his design of Hyppolyta, and
that of the leader of the car, who returns with his compa
nions.    He informs us that Darcis is engraving it. We
can tell him, however, that Darcis never lived to finish this
engraving.
   Charles Vernet laboured        a great   deal in his latter years.
                                                                  One

                              Present State      of the
  One third of his designs belongs to Roland, the printseller,
  v ho has already got several of them extremely well engraved ;
  particularly fourteen, by Debucours, in the soft manner in
 which he excels. Five other large designs are not equally
 well engraved. There is one of them in China ink, an
 other in bistre,        and    some coloured ones        of great beauty ;
 among others,         a Departure     for  the  Chase.    Vernet is at pre
 sent occupied with his grand piece, the Battle *f Marengo.
     Robert is merely named : the author, therefore, does not
 know      the extent    of his  talents    :  France, however, never had
 such    a   painter  as  Robert for the interior of pieces of archi
 tecture.       He   was    as well acquainted with perspective at
 Panini,      and delineates     it in    a   manner highly agreeable to
 the eye.       At one time,        one   could not inhabit a dwelling-
 house without          having    a  bed-room or a saloon decorated
 with Robert's pictures.            His works       are  of different quali
 ties ;  he sometimes went            too fast,     by   wishing to do too
 much.        We    have    sometimes wished           him to finish a little
 more; hut perhaps, by being more fini.-ihed, he would not
know how to preserve the spirit which always reigns in his
rural scenery and in his architecture : his talents would be of
great use in theatrical decorations.               His figures are not cor
rect, hut they never want spirit.                 The best pictures of this
waster are a part of his studies -in Italy.                 He engraved at
Rome       a  small architectural work which he called his Soirees,
and which has given us cause to regret that he has not done
more.         Robert treated     his. own. style       of painting with    so
much superiority that he never had any rivals ; and France
will wait long ere she finds another Robert ; particularly in
an age where all the men of genius aim at historical paint
ing.      Robert has perhaps made too many designs ; but not
for those who love taste and agreeable effect.                 He has done
a great many pieces with red and black crayons.
    The French       themselves      pay more justice than       M. Fiorillo
does    to Greuze,       although his method of designing has no
thing     in   common       with the present school.            He thinks it
extraordinary that he should he called a painter of a parti
cular school      ;  he would rather have him called           " the painter
of the     people or the nation,        because     his pictures very often
                                                                   represent

                    Arl of Painting     in France.               249
represent the most characteristic traits of the entire manner
in which the French think and feel." But the good and bad
actions which occupy the pencil of the celebrated Greuze
do not belong exclusively to the French nation ; they are
common to all nations.            We find in all countries men
who have nothing to leave to their families at their death,
except their good reputation ; there are every where mothers
who love their children      ;  sick persons who are consoled by
their children   ; as well as   there are children who endeavour
to destroy the will of their father when they think that it is
not favourable to them ; and there are also children who even
attempt the lives of those who have given them birth.             He
grants more nobleness of style to Greuze than was pos
sessed by Cornelius Troust, or Hogarth : I do not know
where he has derived this comparison.            M. Fiorillo thinks
that Diderot has praised Greuze with too much enthusiasm.
He thinks the colouring of Greuze          is mannered :  he has not
seen, therefore. any of his heads ; at least, he does not men
tion them.      Few artists have painted with so much senti
ment and truth     as he has   done  :  in France he still passes for
a good colourist.     The author says, " that Greuze endea
voured never to Jose sight of the simplicity of nature; but
Nature herself is mannered at Paris." Nothing is easier
than to vilify a whole nation.         Greuze made a quantity of
designs, which can only be regarded as mere studies, all
full of sentiment.     Greuze created his own school, and it
 perished with him.
    The Germans, Italians,       and English, exclaim against the
 French school, because they envy its superiority.          The man
 who has regarded Europe with an impartial eye for the last
 ten years,  surely cannot think that there is any school in
 existence at present, except the French school : no country
 possesses so great a number      of historical painters, or so great
 masters, as France does. Among other nations there are
 distinguished talents : a Fuger, a West, an Abildgaard, ind
 a Hctsch, will always do honour to their country ; and yet
 for all this there is not a   German school, an English school,
 or  a Danish school.
    It  is necessary that    I should quote      some    passages  of
                                                       M. Fiorillo's

£30                                 Present State        of   the
M. Fiorillo's Introduction                    to the History of the new French
school.        He                     "
                       that the modern artists take David
                     asserts
for their model, and exaggerate his defects without possess
ing his talents." He finds, however, that the present is su
perior to the old French school, and he continues in this
manner     :
               "    The    greatest       part   of   the     works    of the modern
school resemble coloured statues or bas-reliefs                         ;    the contours
of   the figures are sharp and edgy, the expression speaking;
but the composition is empty, cold, and dry : in short, the
colouring is hard, as if .they did not choose any thing in
nature except         a    local colour,          and as      if they only sought to
relieve the effect by forced shades which fall into the dark.
The modern French artists think that they have surpassed
the simplicity of the Greeks in their works ; but they con
found simplicity with emptiness,                        and laboured composition
with    the great         pains they take to become flat and insipid.
As    they are not possessed        of a pure and classical sentiment,
they remain at the entrance of the temple of Taste, without
finding the fundamental principle of it ; and it would seem
that the genius of the times removes them from what is
called the ideal          of       the art,   &c."       These are the bad French
artists of whom           M. Fiorillo         speaks,     because he has not suc
ceeded in drawing a picture of the good ones ; for he hat
never seen the works of the latter, and he judges by those
of   the former.          He afterwards          says,
                                                          " that the    antique ought
to, be studied
             ;                    Michael Angelo studied it ;
                      that Raphael and
but that they endeavoured, surrounded as they were with
noble, grand, and spiritual forms, to idealize, as it were, the
forms of nature." The author is therefore ignorant that the
good French painters study Nature much, and that she never
was more studied by any school : as a painter, he ought to
know that people sometimes see with different eyes.
     M. Fiorillo      that the picture of Saint Roch curing
                      says
those    infected with the plague, laid the foundation of the
celebrity of David             :    he might     have added          to this, what has
been said      of   the   Horatii,        that this picture alone would                 have
been    sufficient        to secure           immortality       to him.         I    do not
like to   speak       of any thing unless I                   have    seen    it,   because
in that    case     it    is       my own judgment,            at least, that       I  pro
                                                                                    nounce   ;

                                         I
wrote upon the             performances of David, not having been at
Marseilles at that time              :       I   have been there, however, several
times since, and had an opportunity of often admiring one
of the chefs-d'ceuvres of this great artist. I may even prophesy
that in future ages pilgrimages will be made for the sake of
admiring it.   I request M. Fiorillo will add to his second
edition the few words [ am now going to say, if he has any
confidence in my judgments.
   The picture of Saint Roch was commanded from David
for the administration of the department of Marseilles. He
did it at Rome in 1 780.    On receiving     the purchasers          it,
thought    too fine to deprive connoisseurs and amateurs of
             it
it: they therefore gave up their first idea, of placing   in                             it
their own hall, and sent       to the office of the records,
                                                 it
where    has since remained.
           it                  The subject of the picture                                     is
Saint Roch addressing the Virgin, supplicating her to cause
the plague to cease.    He    upon his right knee, and resis
                                                 is
the end of his left fool upon one of the sick persons.   He
lifts his clasped hands to the Virgin, who       seated with the      is
infant Jesus.    Below there    at full length a dying person
                                                 is
who rests himself upon his left arm         little higher up are
                                                            :    a
two young people expiring.   The expression in the head of
Saint Roch   very fine
                     is the design of the whole figure
                                     ;                                                        is
admirable  upon examining in detail his arms, legs, and
                 :
hands, we^re equally satisfied.    The composition    simple,                     is
and well connected in all     its parts.  Expression    never                       is
wanting  we :think we  see   dying  persons  in looking upon
the poor diseased creatures. The Virgin pleased me least of
all
  ;  her colouring   not so fine as that of the rest of the pic
                              is
ture.  David appears in this work as great     colourist as                a                  a
designer  and; he destroys the opinion of some of his pupils,
who assert that design and colouring never go hand in hand.
After having          seen Saint       Roch,    do not know whether to
                                                      I
give the preference            to   the Horatii or to Saint Roch.
      Fiorillo    speaks      of Btlisarius            with esteem         :   he relates the
same       anecdotes      I   have       already       printed   :   he does      not think
the head of Belisarius noble.                         "Every     body would            take   it
for    a   French invalid."              I       did not experience the same sen
                                                                                        sation

   25*                 Present Slate      of the
   sation on looking at this picture ; and I never heard this re
  proach made by any French artist.           This picture at present
  belongs to the senator Lucien Bonaparte.
      He praises much the design of the Horatii         ;  but according
  to him the composition is defective ;        he thinks the posture
  of the oldest son confined. " The father (he says), who is
  in the middle of the picture, resembles an old serjeant, who
 is drilling three recruits according to strict military tactics."
 The father of the Horatii never inspired this sentiment. Fio-
 rillo thus continues : — " In the head of the father no trait of
 his visage characterizes a man who is exposing his children
 to the greatest danger, and who sees them perhaps for the
 last time." This judgment would not be at all surprising if
 it did not come from     a  painter, who ought to know the dif
 ferent sentiments of mankind          as well as he ought to know
 the effect   produced by the mixture of the different colours.
 Was it ever possible to express better, in the same head, the
joy of saving his country, and the fear of exposing his chil
 dren to danger?      The most powerful passion ought natu
 rally to carry away the victory in the mind         of   the most sen
 sible father.
     The author  says, at the end   of his article upon Brutus, that
many people prefer this picture to that of the Horatii.               In
France,    great beauties   are discovered in both ; but we gene
rally give the preference to the Horatii.
    We read in a note that Morel has engraved the Horatii,
Brutus, and the Sabines : all this is false ; none of the three
engravings have yet appeared.            It is certain that he is oc
cupied with the Horatii ; but he has a full year's labour yet
before him.      The graving tool of an artist does not move so
quickly as the pen of an author.
    The portrait of mademoiselle Brognard         is mentioned    with
out any distinction among the other portraits of Gerard :
this portrait, however, deserves great praise, and it ought to
be placed by the side of the Joconde of Leonardo da Vinci.
    Every thing which comes from the pencil of Gerard is
beautiful ; every thing is wisely conceived : he paints with
out having the air of painting : his full length portrait of
madame      Recamier    has done him       much honour.         He  has
                                                                painted

                     Arl of Painting     in France.                      253
painted several portraits of his friends in a sitting or two.
 I ought to mention here the celebrated Duels; no pencil ever
produced more in less time.
    Gerard has     also   done some portraits of his friends, de
signed at one sitting, which may serve as a model for those
who wish to design in this manner.                 I may ,quote those of
 madame Redoute and her daughter, of mademoiselle                      Coli-
 quert, and my own, of which I am not a little vain.
    Ingre ought to go to Rome; but he has not yet set out, as
 the author says.      We expect great things from him. The
 design of Stratoriice, which he is doing for me, is well com
posed and well designed, and we may hope to see a fine pic
 ture of it. He has finished several portraits, among which
 we distinguish that of mademoiselle Riviere, 14 years of age.
    M. Fiorillo thinks      that Gros   has     talents ;  but he forgets
 to assign to this artist the distinguished              place which his
 country has given him among the pupils of David, and
 which he so justly merits.           fie thinks it astonishing that
 such a terrible subject as the Plague of Egypt, of this painter,
 should have excited so much enthusiasm.                I  am very happy,
 on the contrary, thatjustice        has been done to a fine picture,
 well designed, well painted, and           finely coloured.          Gros is
 one of  the first colourists    of the modern school.          Our author
 does not recollect, therefore, that such            subjects have been
 represented   by the first talents.    fie  does not know        Milliard's
  Plague, Poussiti's Massacre of the Innocents,                 his Deluge,
 and many others.
     The name of mademoiselle Gerard is mixed, without
 mercy, in a crowd of others who are scarcely known.                      Her
  name merits some distinction.           Her pictures arc agreeably
 composed; the subjects are well chosen, executed with a
 careful pencil,    and    finely coloured.        A  great deal has been
 engraved   after her.
     The author   is not well pleased with the miniatures             of Au-
 gustin;   he has,    perhaps, never seen them; at least, he is
 surely not acquainted with the portrait of Chaudet.                       He
  speaks of  Taunay     as  of  a historical     painter.    It  is true  that
  he has done some        historical pieces   ;   but his name has been
  confounded    with others.        Taunay      has   a peculiar style      of
                                                                     painting

   254                    Present    State   of  the
  painting of his own. He is excellent at figures, pural scenery,
  and architecture : he composes well, and varies his man
  ner : nd person has wrought more than he has done, and
  there is genius in every thing he undertakes.
      Chaudet, the sculptor, is mentioned with eulogium for his
  picture representing the Flight of jEneas : but his design*
 ought also to be mentioned.
                                        " The Triumph of Psyche"
 is very fine* he made several designs for Didot's grand edi
 tion of Racine.      He is an engraver also. His designs are
 well composed and well executed. .
     Thibault, the architect, is only mentioned          for some pic
 tures he did ten years ago;        the author, therefore,    has never
 heard    of the grand and fine landscape he painted for prince
 Louis, in which Rinaldo and Armida are represented.
 M. Fiorillo is not acquainted with the pieces in water co
 lours by this master; he does not know that in this branch
 he has surpassed all that went before him.                I shall only
 mention his View near Tivoli, and that of the Village of Est.
 M. Fiorillo is also ignorant of Thibault's performances in
 architecture and in perspective : this artist has begun a work
 upon perspective, which when published will be a trea
 sure to the arts.      His studies in China ink are full of truth
 and beauty.
     In naming Bourgeois, something should            have been said of
 his bistre drawings,      which     are very fine.      His Bridge of
 Sevcs surpasses    every   thing of   the kind.
    The pictures of Demarne,          M.   Fiorillo  says, have the air
of being done in        a dark chamber:         this accusation might
have been spared,      as   well as  that of his compositionstbeing
flat and common.          Tic ought rather to have spoken of the
beauties to be found in Demarne's landscapes ; and he ought
to have said that he paints animals extremely well, and that
his pencil is very careful.
    We find    the name    of Ommeganck in M. Fiorillo's work ;
but we are    astonished not to find it said that he paints well,
and that none can portray sheep better than he does.
    I  did not know    that the youngest of the Redoutes paints
or designs flower-pieces only : he belonged to the expedi
tion to Egypt, and has carried the art of drawing fishes in
                                                                 water

water colours to       a  perfection which       leaves nothing for us to
desire.
   M. Fiorillo      charges    the   French    with unsuccessfully imi
tating    the   Flemish     painters;     but they    had no occasion to
imitate them at all.         Taunay, Demurne, Drolling, Swebach,
mademoiselle Gerard, Boily, and others, have produced pic
tures which, without being copied after the Flemish, will
do honour to their genius with posterity.
   I  have thus corrected the defects          I  have found in    running
over the work of       M. Fiorillo      ; and I   must do him the justice
at the same time to say, that his works contain some well
written articles, and that he is acquainted with literature ; but
he writes hastily.       In order   to compose a work upon the state
of the    arts in any country,        it requires   a  long time to collect
materials, particularly when the author is not in the country
itself.
   It would he tedious to          mention in detail the artists whom
M. Fiorillo has entirely           forgotten; I shall merely mention
their names with some notes, in order that he may inquire
for their productions, if he ever gives, what is very much to
be desired, a second edition           of his work.
   Among the pupils of Casanova we look irt vain for the
names     of Norblin, Mayer, Duverger, and of Duvivier. Nor-
blin is one of the first battle painters : he lived a long time
in Poland: he paints well, and his composition is agreeable.
I am in possession of some fine designs of his'in bistre and
Indian ink. Mayer died very young, ind was buried at
Ermenonville by the side of J. J. Rousseau.                   He possessed
a great genius.        Duverger died young also": I know several
very   fine  desigris  of his. Duvivier, who remained with his
master until he died, lives at Vienna, and paints with great
success.
   Lantara painted and designed in the taste of Claude Lor-
rain, and his pictures have an agreeable effect ; his designs,
generally in black crayons, are very much sought after.
   M.    deBoisseu, of Lyons, a true amateur, is one of the best
designers I know : no one is superior to him in using Indian
ink: his landscapes are true portraits of nature; the very
   Vol. 27. No.       107.   April   1807.      R                     hour

256                  Present   State of    the
hour of the day is observed in them : his figures, his animals,
every thine is beautiful in his designs. M. Boisseu engraves
in a manner which leaves him few rivals.
   The painters of Geneva are entirely forgotten by the au
thor. The works of St. Ours, Vaucher, Topper, Larrive,
Linck, and others, deserve his attention.
    Professor Jay, of Grenoble, ought to have          been  named    :
he has been in    Italy, and designs landscape and figures ex
tremely   well.
   Gamelin, who lives at Carcassonne, in the south of France,
has great talents for battle pieces;     it is a misfortune to   him
that he does not live in     a great city.     Historical pieces are
not his forte, however; but in the country a painter must do
every thinir.
   Pillement    senior, who is still living at Lyons, ought to
have been well known by the author          : a great deal  has been
engraved from his designs. Even Woollett has rendered him
immortal : the designs most easily made by him are always
the best.
   Perignon has done some drawings with a very agreeable
touch   : the designs for  M.  de la Borde's Travels in Switzer
land are by   him.    They all belong at present to M. Van der
Nuil, of Vienna.       They are well done; but perhaps he had
not sufficient genius to seize upon the grand masses in this
majestic country. Nature in a cultivated state, and nature in
a savage state,   should be represented in a different manner.
If the latter does not strike an artist, he cannot do it justice.
   Moreau junior is not named at all. His talents are sure
ly known, however, in Germany          :  the numerous      works  of
this man, unique in his line, have been almost all engraved.
I shall instance his designs for two editions of Voltaire. His
fertile gemus prevents us from accusing him of copying
himself, far less of stealing from others ; his subject always
penetrates   his mind in such   a manner, that his design never
fails of becoming      an excellent picture.       His compositions
are wisely conceived, and his figures are well drawn,; his
designs, which are generally in bistre or Indian ink, are
neither too much nor too little finished.        I hope that France
                                                                  will

will long retain this estimable artist.               Posterity will be un
able to conceive how one man could have found time to
make all the drawings which go by his name. The indus
trious man who is endowed with genius, produces he knows
not how.
   His brother, known by            the name      of Moreau the landscape
painter, died a long time ago           :   he painted with great facility,
but was not always careful in his works                    :  his' tone is not
always the truest in the world.
   Wille,    the engraver, is still alive*             He is the patriarch
of artists,   and   is    now 92 years old.            The revolution de
stroyed his fortune, and only his life was saved : if to have
laboured much and well, and to have done great service to
the arts, deserves       a  recompense, it is surely Wille who de
serves it.     He was the reviver of engraving in France, which
seemed to have been lost since the days of Edelinck, Audran,
Drevet,    and   others.        The   " Muaiciens       ambuluns"      and   his
"   Cleopatra" will always entitle him                to enjoy the epithets
we have now given him.               All     that Europe can boast        of iu
point of engraving           has come from his school.             His leisure
hours were employed in designing, and generally in study
ing rural scenes.
    Wille junior    has done several pictures ; but for these some
years   past   he has       not painted any thing : he handles his
pencil in a most wonderful manner.                   His designs in black
crayons are carefully done ; and there are some coloured
ones to which the same remark applies.
   La Fontaine     is one     of the best painters     of domestic scenery.
Ganda. would have been far forward as an artist by this time,
if he had not died too soon          : 1  am in possession      of  a very pre
cious work of his      ;   it is his Travels in Italy, comprising more
than 400 studies and designs. Banks was educated by Casas,
and travelled    in Italy for him : he excelled in water colours.
Laurentz designs animals very well, and seizes upon effects
with propriety:       his pencil is astonishing.             Mandewar is a
landscape painter ; he is chiefly known for the light and
 agreeable manner in which he works with lead pencils. Bera
 designs natural history well ; he is a pupil of Redoute, and
 he endeavours     to     follow the footsteps of his master.              Bri-
                                      R   2                             jandet,

258       Present State     of the Art of Painting in France.
jandet, an able         landscape painter, is dead.           In his   trees
 we observe that he studied nature much, and that he studied
 her with good effect.         No man can paint a head better than
 Wallin    ;  it  i* a pity he has not studied nature;           his incor
 rectness, perhaps, would have been less.                 The two Ozanes
 are excellent at designing sea pieces: one of them has en
 graved a great deal, and has done it well.                  They are ac
 quainted with        the forms    of   vessels,  and they give them      in
 an agreeable manner.           Bcrgevin designs very well with the
 pen,   and  composes      has  reliefs with facility.      Misthack gave
 great hopes.        He designed landscape well, and executed with
 care the details      of architecture. He      was a pupil    of Belanger.
 The journey        he made   with    M.  Blanco de Brant in the south
 of France did him        great service.      He   died last year.
     Percier,    the architect,     has   made some fine designs in
 water colours,       consisting of antique       and architectural sub
jects : he has an exquisite taste for furniture.
     Baltard, the architect, favourably known by several works,
 designs architecture and landscape extremely well.
    Eertaux, who has been distinguished generally by the
name of the modern Callot, designs with an astonishing fa
 cility. I have seen, with very great pleasure, his pen and
 ink design of the Battle of Austerlitz, which he is engrav
ing for placing below the portrait of the French emperor.
    Pillement junior, whom I ought to call the first landscape
engraver, designs perfectly well this kind of drawing.
    Several sculptors are distinguished for their designs.              The
 name of Moitte has been for a long time favourably known
among the amateurs of designs : a great deal has been en
graved after him.          His designs are well composed and well
conceived.         Taunay, the sculptor, his pupil, has not made
many designs, but they are very fine ones.                   I possess two
 of them ; one representing Charon, to whom Mercury has
 delivered the Shades of those who are to pas? the Styx: all
 seem desirous       of returning   :  the small heads      are full of  ex
 pression;     the composition       is agreeable,    and  the Mercury is
of   an astonishing lightness.          The other is Time extinguish
ing   the Torch      of Love. One of the first painters said it was
worthy of Julio Romano; I have therefore nothing to add.
                                                                    Boichot

                  Upon the Preparation        of Indigo.             259
Boichot designs very well after the old            masters ; he prefers
the Florentine     school.     Naudet is one of those artists who
unites in one person all the qualities of a travelling painter.
He has accompanied me for these five years past in my tra
vels. The 500 designs, which are the fruit of these travels,
will prove the accuracy       of my opinion.
   I may have still omitted some very distinguished artists,
who may have been forgotten by M. Fiorillo also ; and as
I have trusted to my memory alone, my only desire has been
that it should not deceive me too often.
XLIII.    Upon the Preparation of Indigo for obtaining Blue
                   Colours for printing Calicoes*.
JV1. HAUSSMANiin          a letter addressed to M.Berthollet, gives
an account    of  the manner in which the solution           of indigo is
prepared, by means of an alkaline solution           of  red arsenic, for
the use of calico printers.
   He merely makes a caustic alkaline solution of red arsenic,
to which he adds, while it is still boiling, a sufficient quan
tity of indigo bruised, in order to obtain a very deep shade ;
which it is still easy to render more or less intense, as the
object may require, by diluting the solution of indigo with a
weak ley of caustic potash, which is preferable to pure water,
because   it retards a little- the absorption of the oxygen of the
atmosphere, and consequently retards the regeneration of the
indigo. The beauty of the blue in the stuffs requires that tfus
regeneration should npt be too sudden or too tardy.                  The
too slow absorption, proceeding from a too great excess of
caustic alkali,    should be avoided in the blue for pencilling
with,  as well  as  in the sone blues, which advantage we procure
by passing the stuffs printed with bruised indigo, mixed with,
a gummy solution of sulphate of iron, alternately through
vats  of caustic potash, sulphate of iron oxidated          at the mini
mum, and finally through            a vat acidulated by the sulphuric
 or muriatic acids.

always with success; i, e. with the formation of muriatic

laboratory with          a   pile d'alizeau of seventy pairs only.   It is
more thati        a year     ago  since  I was convinced of  the truth of
this interesting experiment, which would not be called                                                 in;

Society, the apparatus made use of for obtaining the mu
riatic acid was constantly covered with a glass receiver, or
bell glass, which prevents the contact of the air surrounding
the pile, and preserves such gases as may be liberated. This
receiver does not seem to injure the experiment, the success
of which chiefly depends on the number of plates or metallic
disks,   as  well  as   on the cleanness      of their surface.     The
greater the number          is, the more muriatic      add is formed.
As   to the extent     of surface,   that  augments very little the
action in this experiment, as        has been demonstrated when
plateb of more than a foot of surface have been used.
XLV.       Letter from W. Thornton, Esq. to the Merr.bcrs of
            the North Carolina Gold Mine Company.
-.-    GBKTLEMKN,
J- LATELV visited        the land in   North Carolina belonging to
the company,      and rode several      days in various parts of it.
The fertility of the soil exceeded very much the most fa
vourable idea I had formed of it.           I saw some of the best
corn in it that I saw during our whole route through Vir
ginia and North Carolina, and I was informed by general
Steele, late comptroller of the United States, who resides
not far from the lands, that he had made particular inquiries
respecting them, since my former visit, and learnt that they
were very good corn and cotton lands, and it wai his opinion,
if  the company       kept the lands    a little, while till they could
select such portions lor the gold as they might incline to re
tain, they might sell the remainder for the whole purchase
money they gave, viz. 1 10,0O0 dollars.            Some of ihe corn I
thought so fine, was in ground that had been in cultivation
for ten years — and this is the driest year that the oldest in
habitants remember lor fifty years.
    The grounds, except in a few cultivated places, are gene
rally covered with good timber.             Some company viewing
ilie land with me,         measured   one of the trees by the road
side,   and   found    it nine feet six inches circumference, and
above a hundred feet high        : orchards of applog, peaches, &c.
                                    R4                          flourish.

262                  Lelterfrom W. Thornton, Esq.
 flourish    in a very luxuriant manner, and red clover, with
 plaister of Paris for a manure, grows astonishingly.
    Before I mention the gold runs, it may be proper to ob
 serve    that   the   healing springs are surrounded within the
 distance of half a mile by the company's land.                  These are
 powerfully chalybeate,           and   were   resorted   to from   various
 parts   of the country,       as well  as South Carolina, not only on
 account of the tonic virtues of the water, but also in con
 sequence      of the salubrity of the air and healthiness of the
 country.       From the number who have visited these springs
 this summer, (the first) it is imagined they will be much re
 sorted to hereafter.
    This    was one      of  the   most unfavourable seasons       I could
 have selected for an examination            of the runs for gold. They
 were dry, like most        of those   we passed in    Virginia and North
 Carolina; indeed         so dry that no examination could be made
 of  them    for  gold but with great trouble, as it was necessary
 to carry the sand and gravel in small portions, sometimes
 above a mile,        before water could      be found; and what gold
 was obtained was          principally   found    by washing the gravel
 and sand where there was water, rather than by searching
 for the gold where there were indications ; and though this
 was the case, I did not see a single frying-pan full of gravel
 and sand washed          without    gold being found therein.       Some
 fine specimens were thus obtained, one about two penny
 weights, and some smaller : but after we had obtained about
 twenly dollars worth, we were prevented from proceeding, by
 the want of water to wash for more — though, from what I
 saw,   I  am   of opinion     we might have got some hundred dol
lars   worth      in  a very   short distance     if  the branch had not
dried up.         While     we were     engaged     in washing   for gold,
 Mr. Love, one of the proprietors of the adjoining mine of
Mr. Read, on washing. some of our gravel and sand, in
which      he   found gold, said in my hearing, that he really
thought      our    prospect as good as theirs.           They have only
four hundred acres; and though it is said they have obtained
between thirty and forty thousand dollars worth of gold from
this small place, they value it still at one hundred tho/isand
dollars* We possess thirty-five thousand acres at least!
,     ..                                                               The

            to the   North Carolina Gold Mine Company.                 263
The gold of our land           is perfectly pure, and requires no re
fining.  I visited Mr. Read's mine, and found that by amal
gamation with quicksilver, which is very easy, and which
answers completely, a great quantity of gold is obtained
from the sand, after picking out all the lump gold.     I was
informed they got about six or seven ounces at a distillation,
several  times a week, from a very small still. I afterwards
visited the mines of Mrs. Parker and Mr. Harris.    They lie
in a hill that intersects the company's land. Mr. Harris, in
ploughing across a small branch in his land, turned up a
good sized piece of gold.      Having no regular weights, he
tried it in a pair of scales against a pewter plate and spoon,
which it outweighed.       He then searched the run, and was
successful in finding gold. This little branch runs immedi
ately into the company's land, lying between it and Mrs.
Parker's.   But it was dry, and I consequently made no
search in     it,   nor in any of the branches on that side, though
I   heard   of gold being found in      several.
  Mrs. Parker's mine was discovered in very unexpected a
manner.   Hearing of several discoveries, she said in joking       a
manner to some company while drinking tea with her,
" wish, gentlemen, any of you could rind gold mine in
I                                                          a
my land." On which Mr. Etherton said, "I will go, madam,
and search for you." He went, and in       little time returned
                                                   a
with very good specimen. After this they found six hun
       a
dred      dollars worth,      and   this season    three   hundred more,
though they had not yet prepared any apparatus for even
washing the gravel and sand. They were making      small           a
wooden machine when     was therCt
                               I
 I   cannot pretend to give an account of all the places
where gold has been discovered in the grounds belonging to
the company, for    will take some time before they can be
                         it
sufficiently explored, and but few of the streams and small
runs have been searched in the slightest manner.       Every
place   examined,   though some   lie many  miles apart, has
furnished gold, except one, and that had but  very slight      a
examination,   and perhaps not deep enough.  Among the
principal places that promise well, from the small trials
 made,    I   must mention          the Rock-hole creeks, which         are
                                                                   branches

   264             Letter from IV. Thornton, Esq.
   branches that    join about three miles below their sources.
  The one where I got most of the gold, in consequence of
   there being a small supply of water, is the west branch. The
  upper end could not be examined, nor any place but one, for
  want of water. The east branch is supposed from a single
  trial to be good, but the want of water prevented any further
  search. Three forks of Island creek, about three miles each,
  contain   gold ; but little search could be made for the same
  reason.    Mr. Roltins, who lives below, told me he found
 gold below the junction of these branches — some was found
  in Cucumber creek. The prospect good. Some in the
  Camp branch of Island creek, also in Long creek and below
 Mr. Harris's. Mrs. Osburn took only as much sand and
 gravel as she could carry between her hands, from a small
 spring in the company's              land between     the Rock-hole
 branches, and on washing it found a piece equal to a dollar,,
 and two pieces equal to half a dollar in value, besides some
 smaller pieces.      It appears on examination that some of the
 hills are rich in gold ; and I think it is not carried far by the
 currents, but only falls down into the small hollows and
 little branches near which it originally lies, as it has been
 found in considerable quantities in the smallest depressions.
 on the hills, as well as in the more deep runs and branches.
 Were    we to measure      all the runs, the small branches, the
 springs and depressions where gold has been found in the
 company's land, I think I may admit the truth of the cur
rent opinion there, that the company possess 100 miles of
gold land.      Though it may be highly advantageous to work
some     of the places already discovered, and particularly
Rock-hole branch, and the Spring branch, I think a further
 examination of the runs essential, as it is admitted' our
discoveries already made entitle us to expect immense re
turns,   if our operations be well directed in the first instance.
The    expenses   are so very     trifling, that  the whole necessary
apparatus    will not cost    200 dollars ; but the particulars   will
be laid before the directors,        for their consideration.
                        I  am, gentlemen,
                                 Very respectfully, &c.

 Lectures     on the Art of Engraving, delivered at the Royal
    Institution of Great Britain.          By JOHN LANDSEEH, En
    graver to the King, and F. S. A. Bvo.
AT gives      us some     pleasure   to be able to announce the pub
 lication    of  these   Lectures,    which, by    the amateurs   of en
 graving,     have    been    anxiously expected    to  make their ap
pearance.        It is well known that before Mr. Landseer had
 finished his proposed course, he received a notification fronv
 the managers that they had resolved to discontinue his lec
 tures;    and it is equally well       known that the      real or sup
 posed crime which           procured Mr. Landseer's dismissal from
the lecture-room,         was his " having alluded to a certain in
dividual — not a livingcharacter" — the late alderman Boydell.
 Mr: Landseer        states,   and we have never heard the fact con
 tradicted, that his dismissal was            the act  of four managers
 who had not been present at the offensive lecture, and who,
 even refused afterwards to hear the- exact words he had- made
 use of read to them !          In the preface the author has offered
 some just, and we think, all the circumstances considered,
 temperate remarks on this transaction.             How could lecture*
 of the smallest      use,   on an art so important, and on which
 nothing had before been given in the English language, be
 delivered without alluding to those who had been engaged
 in the commercial         part of the business ? We might as well
 expect     a history    of any country to be produced, without
 those ministers being alluded to that have at times involved
 their country in danger by tlxeir individual folly and miscon
 duct.      The author affirms what cannot be denied when he
 says,
          "  No lecture upon art has ever been delivered without
 personal allusions.         Not the having alluded, then, but the
justifiable or unjustifiable nature and occasion of the allu
 sion, was the fit object of inquiry." , Thu lectures are now
before the public, and the public will judge impartially, we-
 doubt not, between the parties.
     It is impossible to spare room in a work like ours to give
»ven an analysis-of lectures which trace the art from its early
                                                                 origin,

Etruscan, Sidouian, Greek, Roman, and modern engraving,
iu its multifarious forms — as exhibited on sacerdotal orna
ments, signets, hieroglyphics, scarabees, instruments of war,
 furniture,  gems, coins, and prints ; nor could any analysis
convey to our readers a correct idea of the instruction and
information these lectures are calculated to afford, not only
to those who by their habits and pursuits may be supposed
more immediately interested in such inquiries, but to every
person possessing a cultivated mind. The subjoined ex
tracts from the third lecture (p. 148 and 176) will serve as
a specimen of the author's style, and his manner of treating
his subject.
    "  Toward the close of my last discourse (on the several
species of modern engraving) I found myself obliged to an
ticipate that the meanings I annex respectively to the words
general and particular, as applied to works of art, would
not be misunderstood      :  an anticipation of some terms is not
easily avoidable, and can be no reason why they should not
be subsequently explained.
    " To   particularise,   is to be attentive to the minutiae,
severally considered, of the object or objects before us.      In
imitative art, it is to represent those objects in detail.—
In explatning the term generalising, as it is less well under
stood, I shall be obliged to be more diffuse.
    " To generalise, is not to render vague and indeterminate,
but to express with sufficient firmness, what is common to a
number of objects of the same class. A general idea, if the
word idea may be used to signify any other than recalled and
particular sensation, is a generic idea ; and a general repre
sentation or description, in painting or in poetry, is also
generic, or such a representation as is common to a number.
In moral philosophy, general ideas being comparatively
vague and indeterminable, have sometimes been denied to
exist  ; but in art, they may be rendered obvious, may be
'returned back to the sense from whose particular impressions
they are constituted or abstracted :' and this, I believe, is
practicable in all arts, though perhaps not in the same de
gree.    The statuary, the poet, the painter, the engraver, th«

ralising,     it may   be questioned whether any have attained            to
high  and lasting reputation.
     "
     Great mistakes have arisen in the philosophy of art (if
not in the philosophy of morals) from confounding a gene
ral, abstract, or common               idea or representation,     with    a
vague idea or representation.             Now, with     respect to art, the
difference is very important, amounting in our critical rea
sonings, to as much as the difference between a bust chiselled
in   the rough,     and a finished head       of   an angel or   deity: —a
Jesus Christ, for example, can only be exalted                above all in
dividual men, by possessing what is common                     to all good
men in character and expression.
     "
    Permit me then to repeat, that             a   general representation
is not      a vague, but a generic representation         : not a repre
sentation of what is hastily seen or carelessly noticed and
imperfectly recognised, but a firm representation of what is
most frequently seenf What is most frequently seen, is
best remembered            ;   what is common to    a species    or a genus
is more frequently seen than that which is peculiar to an in
dividual : and hence we recollect the general character of
man or woman,      or of the oak or the ash, when they are
well painted or engraven, more strongly than we recollect in
all their details, any particular man or woman, oak or ash,
we have seen.
     " Togeneralise, is therefore to define broadly or compre
hensively; and every comprehensive definition, such as is
proper in a dictionary, must be of this kind : languages,
like the imitative arts, being modes of imparting informa
 tion by exhibiting principled combinations of thought." —
     "As we frequently hear the uninformed talk as if they
 conceived the highest effort of painting was merely to copy
 nature, as nature appears to them, so it is very common to
 hear unreflecting people speak of engraving, as if it were no
 other than an art of copying that of painting : which
 though a great mistake, is yet a very pardonable mistake on
 the part     of   those       who have been led into   it,   when we con
                                                                       sider

                    Notices respecting New Books.
 .sider the state in which        the art of engraving has hitherto
  existed, and the difficulties and the degradation under which,
 in this country, it has hitherto laboured.
     " Now, engraving is no more an art of copying painting,
 than the English language is an art of copying Greek or
 Latin. Engraving is a distinct language of art ; and though
 it may bear such resemblance to painting in the construction!
 of its grammar,       as    grammars     of  languages   bear  to each
 other,    yet its alphabet and      idiom, or mode of expression,
 are totally different.      If English be made the vehicle of the
 same thoughts which have previously been conveyed to us in
 Greek   ;  or  if engraving be made the vehicle of the same
thoughts      which   have previously been imparted to us by
 painting, it affords the means of affecting our minds in the
same manner : this similar affection of the mind has leu* to
 the mistake, and I have little doubt but that English would
have been inconsiderately called an art of copying Greek, if
\ve had never read any other English than translations from
 the Greek.
     "The    pretensions of engraving, as of all the arts denomi
nated fine, are simple, chaste, unsophisticated.               Art ever
disdains artifice, attempts      no  imposition,   but  honestly claims
attention    as being what it is.       A statue is to.be looked at as
being a statue    — not a real figure ; a picture. not as a portion
of actual nature ; a print, not as a copy of painting.
     " An   engraving therefore, that of the death or General
Wolfe, for example, is no more a copy of Mr. West's
picture, than the same composition,                  if sculptured or
modelled in low relief, would be a copy. In both cases they
would be, not copies, but translations from one language of
art into another language of art.            How far Woollett's may
be esteemed       a correct translation,       we shall inquire   upon
some future occasion       :  at present, let those to whom the di
stinction is not rendered       sufficiently obvious, recollect, that
neither in the case     of   the basso -relievo, nor the engraving is
local colour employed, which forms so indispensable a part
of a picture, and is consequently so essential to the pro
duction of the resemblance of a picture, that it would have
          I                                                        beeu

 work.

 APRIL     9.   The right honourable Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.
 President,   in the chair. — The reading of Capt. Flinders's
 Observations on the magnetic needle was continued.            The
 captain made a great variety of experiments both at sea and
 ashore on the variations of the needle; and was led to con
 clude, that the guns and shot aboard ships are sufficient to
 produce a magnetic atmosphere, which must operate power
 fully on the polarity of the needle.       Hence he infers the
 reason of the variations in the needle according to the di
 rection of the ship's head, which amounted sometimes from
 4 to 8, 9 and even 10 degrees.     As  to the regular variations,
 he found no material difference between his own observa
 tions on the coast of New Holland, and those made by
 Capt. Cook 30 years before.
     April  16.  The President in   the  chair. — The reading of
 Capt. Flinders's paper was concluded ;      and that of another,
 by Everard Home, Esq.
                             " On the Stomachs of Animals,"
 was commenced.        The author's observations     were  first di
  rected to ruminating   animals,  noting their different appear
  ances on dissection, and the number and dimensions       of their
  respective cavities or bags.  He afterwards details his nume
 rous remarks on the size and peculiarities of the stomachs of
  several other animals, all of which were illustrated by well-
 executed designs, taken in general from fresh subjects.
     April 83. The President in the chair. — A letter from      Dr.
  Olbers to   Dr. Young (foreign   secretary   to the society) was
  read, announcing his discovery of a new planet on the 29th
  and ooth of March last.      This planet is about the size of a
                                                                 star

 star of the 5th or 6th magnitude, and was found in the sign
 Virgo.*
    The reading of Mr. Home's paper on the stomachs of
animals was then resumed.                This anatomist continued his
 remarks on the peculiar and the analogous features of this
organ in man, horses, dogs, rabbits, elephants, &c. &c.
which were illustrated by numerous drawings.                      The re
mainder of this paper was postponed till next meeting.

    On Thursday the 23d of April, being St. George's Day,
the Society met at their apartments in Somerset-place, in
pursuance of their statutes and charter of incorporation, to
elect a president, council, and officers, of the society, for the
year ensuing; whereupon

ten of the other members of the Society, were chosen of               the
new council,        and   they were severally declared to be the
council for the year ensuing: and on a report made of the
officers of the Society, it appeared that
          George earl of Leicester was elected president,
          William Bray, esq. treasurer,
          Samuel Lysons, esq. director,
          Rev. T. W. Wright, A. M. secretary ; and

   The surgical prizes given by the college have this year

    We understand that both these essays will very shortly be

        SOCIETY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES OF HAARLEM.
   This Society has proposed the Following as prize questions ;
the answers to be transmitted (post free) Jo M. Van Marum,
their secretary, at Haarlem, on or before the 1st of Novem
ber 1807.      The author of the best of each of the memoirs
is to receive   a gold medal or thirty ducats.         The papers rnay
be 'written in    Dutch,   French,     Latin,  or  German.
    1.  What   have   the most recent observations taught us on
the subject of the influence of oxygen of the atmosphere ?
Is it connected with light in the alteration of colours ; and
what utility may be drawn from such observations i
    2. As experience has shown that rain water, which runs
through leaden pipes, or is kept in lead cisterns, carries off
so much of the metal that the water becomes prejudicial to
health, and occasions fatal         diseases ; and as such food        or
liquids which are prepared in contact with lead are also de
leterious,   the Society, therefore, requires to be informed hf
the best method to prevent or remedy these pernicious ef
fects.    The Society   also particularly requires it to be pointed
out, from actual experiments         and observations,     in what cir
 cumstances     lead  communicates       its pernicious     qualities  to
 water? Whether lead might not be so wrought              as to  prevent
 any bad consequences      ?    Whether    we   have  any reason to be
 afraid of the white lead collected in leaden pipes ? What is
 the best method     of avoiding   any bad consequences from this
 cause  ?  To point out'if there    are any good grounds for       think
 ing that the glazing which is made use of for China or stone
 ware, communicates any of its pernicious qualities to the
 victuals or drink which may be put into vessels made of these

materials;           and what is the best method                  of preventing    these
bad effects      ?
   3. What has experience taught us on the subject of puri
fying putrid water, or other things, by means of charcoal                                 ?
How far can we explain its action on chemical grounds;
and what further advantage can we derive therefrom ?
  4. What is the real difference, in properties and consist
ency, between sugar extracted from sugar-canes, and that
•which is the produce         of    some          trees and plants      ?    Does the
latter contain true sugar           ;   or can we alter it into true sugar ?
   5. What is the cause                 of the shining of sea water?   Does
this arise from the presence of living animals only ? What
are these animals ? and do they communicate any deleterious
effect to the atmosphere ? This is required to be decided
from the result           of positive observations
                                          ; particularly that
it may                how far the shining of the sea, which
           be ascertained
is very remarkable on the coast of Holland, has any connec
tion with contagious and epidemic diseases.
  6. What is the most probable origin of what is called
spermaceti ? Can this substance be separated from whale
oil, or    be produced therein           ?   and could this be done to ad
vantage     ?

  the      1st   of July    1806.            By    M. DELAMBRE,              perpetual
   Secretary.
  To give        hasty sketch of the mathematical labours
                 a                                                              of this
class;     to present it in few words, without, however,                          omit
ting any thing which might ensure to the different authors
the share of applause they have merited; to detail their dis
coveries by employing with reserve the language of science;
to notice their difficult and abstract researches, and at the
same time show their importance,                        if it   does not show     their
whole merit in detail          :   such is the task which                   is imposed
upon us, and the object we attempt, without flattering our
selves we shall be able to attain                 it,
                                                                                   We

    We    have   already heard how rich the harvest of this year
has been in the science of nature : the zeal of the mathe
matical department has not been worse supported, nor less
fortunate.      Even those of our fellow-members who had the
greatest    right, to enjoy in tranquillity the renown acquired
by along series of labours, have not shown less ardour or
less activity.
    Thus, in   the question started on the    subject of the new
measure     of the degree in Lapland,     when it was necessary to
discover the cause of the error which had been committed
in   1736,   M.  Lalande has sought, during the course of long
experience, facts which might put us in the way of the de
sired explanation.         He recollected that at this time^ the use
of    the proving telescope was entirely unknown. This in
strument, so convenient and so simple, which was supposed
to be invented about the same time as ihe application of te
lescopes     to sectors and quadrants, is more modern, how
ever, than we thought : we make use of it every day, as is
too often the case, without inquiring to whom we are in
debted     for it.    It is mentioned for the first time  in M. La-
 lande's Astronomy, in the edition of 1764. In order to adjtfst
 the parallelism of the telescopes, Bouguer recommended the
 use of two little pins, which might reciprocally change places,
 to ascertain whether they really had the same height.            He
 himself madeuse of amore imperfect method, and which may,
 still less than the pins, enter into comparison with M. La-
 lande's proving telescope, so universally adopted at present.
 We are uncertain whether Graham had any thing equivalent
 to this for adjusting his sector: Maupertuis makes no men
 tion of it in the chapter where he treats of the 'adjustment of
 this instrument;       and this negligence may partly explain the
 error which is imputed to him.
     This   same   measure   of the  degree in Lapland has given
 occasion to    M.   Lalande to furnish us with another memoir,
 where he demonstrates the necessity of attending to the
 oblateness of the earth in the operations of levelling which
 reach to any considerable distances.
     The attention of all the astronomers of Paris was given to
 the eclipse of the 16th of June last. To M. Messier, ono

of the members of the class,              we  are indebted for the     only
 observation which succeeded.             The clouds  opened an instant
 for him only,       and permitted him to see the beginning,          which
 he observed       at 4h 52'   43".     He was also able to        measure
 three phases,       the accuracy    of which, however,        he does not
 warrant.
     The atmospheric variations which hindered             us from seeing
 tlie. eclipse, were also unfavourable for the observation of the
solstice ; but as the latter may be supplied by observations
made on the days which precede and follow, we have col
lected    a  sufficiently great number of them together, in order
to find a confirmation of what we have observed for these
ten years past.
     M.   Bouvard,      a pupil worthy of such masters as Messier
 and    Mechain, has discovered two comets, and calculated
their orbits.          Messrs.  Biot    and  Arrago have made these
 same calculations by the method of M. Laplace.                     M. Le-
gendre      has   not    omitted   this   opportunity  of   submitting to
new      trials the formula       he published last year.        We may
justly    remark,     that there is scarcely any method which does
not become inconvenient, or even uncertain, under parti
cular circumstances.           This is precisely what happened this
time    to  M. Legendre; but        he immediately found in his ana
lysis resources to obviate the difficulty, which had not been
foreseen in his first memoir, and to simplify considerably
the general solution which he had given of the problem.
     M.   Legendre is now occupied on a more important ques
tion, although the applications of it are more rare : his
memoir       is entitled    " Analysis of Triangles     described on tlie
                   '
 Spheroid."
    The first astronomers who measured the earth with any
accuracy considered it as. a sphere, the radius of which is
immense in comparison of -the small intervals which they
proposed to ascertain. The largest side of the triangle which
enters into these operations is never 60,000 metres, and the
difference between such an arc and the right line, which joins
the extremities, is scarcely two decimetres, or a three-hun
dred-millionth part.          We may therefore consider, with great
reason, triangles whose curvature is so little,           as  rectilineal.
                                                                          In

                     french National         Institute^                 27 4
    In  operations where it is required to determine more ex-
4ctly the difference between the terrestrial globe and a perfect
sphere, attention must he carried still further.                 Triangles
formed on the surface        of the    earth     were considered as very
small portions of a sphere, which in the extent of each tri
angle differs imperceptibly from the spheroid.
   Does this supposition, less inaccurate than the preceding,
promise all the precision which we wish for ; and since it is
a spheroid which it is required to measure, why have not the
triangles been calculated as spheroidal ? The question is so
natural, that it ought to present itself at first sight to the
astronomers who are occupied with the operation, and to
each   of  the  scientific   rrren  in Europe, who have united in
order to examine and judge the work lately executed.                     In
one of the first meetings of the commission, a learned fo
reigner,    M. Tralles,    remarked that the bases          of Melun and
Perpignan ought not to be simply considered as arcs entirely
in the same plane, but           as curves with a double curvature.
This remark had before           been    made      by Clairaut more than
fifty  years ago; but it was always thought that the effect of
the double curvature could not become in the least sensible,
except upon intervals much greater than those which are
given us to measure directly ; and it was concluded that the
consideration of the spheroid would only uselessly compli
cate calculations which were already become too compli
cated.     In fact,  the spheroid differs far less from the sphere
than the sphere itself differs from a plane.               But the spheri
city of the triangles only introduces into                the calculations
terms of the second order for the angles, and of the third
order for the sides.       It was therefore natural to think that
the terms depending on the spheroid were of an order still
higher, and still more insensible by their extreme minute
ness. But although no person had as yet written upon this
subjeet, w.e ought not to conclude from this that we should
remain contented with vague considerations and simple pro
bability. This point is discussed under the article Calculation
                                               ''
of Triangles in the second volume of The Determinationofthe
Meridian," now In        the press   :  it is expected to demonstrate,

  the difference between the spherical and spheroidal angle* is
  not more than l-6oth       of a second   in the greatest of our tri
  angles, and that the double curvature         does not change the
  length of the greatest of all our sides more than about a cen
  timetre.   These results are confirmed by the ingenious ana-
 lysis of  M.  Legendre.
     To  these  geometrical considerations upon the figure of
 the earth, we were anxious to add the geographical re
 searches upon the extensive plain of the interior of Africa,
 by M. Lacepcde ; the researches upon Persia, and the com
 munication of the Caspian with the Black Sea, by M. Oli
 vier; but   these memoirs belonging more particularly to the
 physical sciences, and having been analysed by M. Cuvier,
 we shall pass on to the New Memoir of M. Ramond upon
 measuring the Height of Mountains by the Barometer.
     We said in our notice of 1805, that there was scarcely
 l-500dth of difference between M. Laplace's coefficient for
 calculating the height of mountains by the observation of
 the barometer, and that which M. Ramond has deduced
 from the numerous observations of this description whicli
he made in the Pyrenees.          Some new researches have en
tirely dispelled   a difference   which  might be attributed to the
uncertainty cither of the barometrical observations, or to the
old experiments upon the weight of the air and mercury ,
which M. Laplace considered as data in his calculation,
M. Biot     has recently repeated     these experiments    with every
possible precaution : it results from this that the coefficient
ought to be diminished by nearly l-500dth, and the agree
ment between the two methods is then complete.                On the
one hand, we      see the geometrician resting on facts observed
in   a cabinet, and deducing from thence a rule for measuring
the height of mountains : on the other hand, we see an ob
server taking for a base the known height of a mountain,
and the effect it produces upon the elevation of the mercury
in the barometer, and concluding from it the relative weight
of mercury and air, and finding again the same quantity
which    was   made use    of as  the foundation   of the geometri
cian's calculations.       These comparisons, which are daily
multiplying in the application of analysis ; these identical
                                                              results,

Iresults,obtained by processes so contrary, and drawn from
phenomena so different, are proofs to which the most ob
stinate sceptic can have nothing reasonable to oppose.
   This important result is not the only merit of M. Ra-
mond's memoir.    We there find means for distinguishing
circumstances which are favourable or contrary to this kind
of observation.   The author ranges them under three dif
ferent titles the Influence of the Time of the Day ; the In
                   :
fluence of Stations ; and the Influence of Meteors.  That of
the time of the day occasions the altitudes observed in the
evening and morning to be always too small ; whence it
follows that it is always best to make observations about the
middle of the day : and this is easily attained.  The influ
ence of stations is not less real, but it is less easy to be
guarded  against. The rule to be followed   that the port        is,
able barometer and the barometer of comparison should be
in stations where            the local circumstances are perfectly simi
lar.                 not always an obstacle thus M. Ra-
        Great distance           is                                :
mond remarked that his observations at the Pyrenees, com
pared with those continually                    made      by   M. Bouvard       at the
Imperial Observatory, present                   a    regular agreement,         whilst
these       same       observations      of M. Bouvard compared                  with
thpse of      M. Ramond           made     at   Marli-la-ville,        indicate from
one day to another, differences of from ten to eleven metres
in the relative height of the two stations; whence we con
clude, that the use of the barometer for measuring heights
that differ but little rather uncertain, when the two sta
                                 is
tions are on       a    plain.
   As   to the Influence              of Meteors,
                                        always acts in the same
                                                     it
sense   ;  makes the heights appear too small, and we ought
            it
to reject all observations made on      stormy day-  a From all
these considerations,     follows, that in order to measure the
                                 it
height of     a    mountain      more accurately, we must not indif
ferently take          a   mean between observations taken at different
seasons,      and at different times            of   the day, as       by   rhis means
we should evidently be liable to find the heights too little.
  We shall not mention the grand work which Messrs.
Biot and Arrago have just concluded, upon the affinities
                                          S     4                             between

 between the different gases and light. M. Biot himself wilt-
 read an extract of it to the Institute.
    There will also be read a memoir by count Rumford, on
 the adhesion       of the molecules of water; but we shall give
 the principal results of the observations made by this learned
 philanthropist, upon the dispersion of the light of lamps by
 the means c-fs/iades and globes of ground glass.
    The facility      with which the eye distinguishes objects,
 does   not merely depend upon the intensity of the light
 which illuminates them, it also depends much upon the
 shadows    ;  if  they are simple and well marked, the vision is
 distinct: but if the light comes from several sides at once,
 there are several shades which confound and weaken them ;
 hence we     see   badly even with a good deal of light. A good
 distribution     of the light is therefore important for (Economy,
 and particularly for the preservation of the eyes.
    The direct rays of a lamp, with a double current of air,
fatigue the sight.         In order to lessen this inconvenience,
 shades   of different kinds      have  been  invented, and   at last
globes of ground glass.          What renders the use of the latter
less common is the fear        of losing too much light. Nobody,
in France at least, has attacked this prejudice, but count
Rumford demonstrates, by an experiment very easy to repeat,
that the loss of light is almost insensible.         The surface of
ground glass, full of furrows and roughnesses, presents to
the light a number of minute smooth planes, but differently
inclined, which dispersing the light, render it softer, and
distribute it in sucn a manner as to cany a more uniform
clearness to every corner of the piece which we wish to
illuminate.
    This advantage is not the only one possessed by ground
glass. Being substituted instead of polished glass, in the
glazing of windows, it will spread the light of day with
more equality in the highest as. well as in the lowest situa
tions, in the furthest as well as the nearest; and this remark
is particularly useful       for great cities, where the confined
width of the streets         and the height of the houses, only
admit ofyhe light penetrating very obliquely.            The author
                                                                 has

                     French National Institute.                    279
has seen    a  proof of this fact     ;  and the explanation he has
given   of it is extremely natural.
    This memoir is terminated by the description of            a  new
lamp,    so   constructed   as   not    to admit   of any direct   ray
being seen, and yet to give the most equable and pleasant        light
in every corner of       a  large   saloon, without throwing any
shade, although the        reservoir for the oil is circular, and
the cylinders which distribute the light are placed in the
centre.
    We should give but        an imperfect    idea  of the labours of
the class,    if  we omitted    to speak of the particular works
of  each  of the members      ;  but the bounds we have prescribed
to ourselves not allowing us to enter into any particular
detail, we can only barely mention the reports upon the par
 ticular Solutions of Differential Equations and Equations of
 Differences, presented by M. Poisson ; on the new Demonstra
 tion of the Principle of the Virtual Velocities, byM. Ampere;
 on a new Method of raising Water to a Great Height, by
 M.   Baader, engineer to the king of Bavaria; on the Expe
 riments of M. Feron, made upon the Physical Strength of
 Savages compared with that of Europeans, and from which
 he has drawn this result,      which will surprise many, —That
 tkere is no comparison in this respect between the civilized
 man and the savage, and that the difference is completely in
 favour   of the former.
    Among the inventions approved by the class, we ought to
 mention the spinning-wheel of M. BeHemere, which enables
 many industrious persons to double their work : the loom
 for wrought and finished stuffs, on account of the simplicity
 of its operation, has been thought worthy to be kept as a
 model, and of a reward from government to M. Rivey> its
 inventor : the stocking loom of M. D'Autry, the reporter of
 which   stated its advantages with so much precision to the
 class,  that    he was ordered to print his report in order to
 serve as a history of the art : lastly, another stocking loom
 of M. Favreau Bouillon, which has reduced all the labour
 to  the simple balancing of two levers ; an advantageous
  improvement, which admits of this machine being easily
  wrought by weak persons, or such as have only one arm.
                                                                 Since.

                           French National Institute.
    Since its last public sitting, the class has published thfc
 first volume of memoirs, presented to it by learned foreign
 ers, and vol. vi. of its own memoirs^         The subsequent
 volumes         will    be published every six months,                  commencing
 with              of July next. The class has also published
           the month
 the first volume of The Meridian of Dunkirk, being the basis
 of the metric -decimal system: this work will contain all the
 observations, all the methods of calculation, which have
 fixed the two fundamental unities of the metrical system,
 the metre and the kilogramme.
   Several members have published                       new works,          and    new-
 editions of works already known, in which we find impor
 tant additions4   Thus M. Legendre has published a sixth
 edition of his Geometry, and M. Lacroix a second edition
of his Traite Elementairc du Calcul Differentiel et Integral.- —
Astronomers have now Tables of the Sun, in which, for the
first time,       the    attractions of all the planets are taken into
 account.
     Lastly,     M.
                 Lagrange has given a more complete edition
of   the Calcul des Fonctions, a truly classical work, which it
would be superfluous to mention here to such geometricians
as have considered the whole of                   it,
                                  and difficult to give in                           a
few words        a   sufficient idea    of   it   to those who have not.           The
same reasons            compel    us to pass rapidly          over   a   dissertation
lately published     M. Laplace as
                            by            supplement to the
                                                        a
tenth book of the Mecanicjite celeste, and in which he gives
a complete theory of capillary action.     For the first time
we   see      these phaenomena         so contrary      in   appearance  happily
referred to one law         ;    the ascension and           depression between
two planes explained              by
                         the same analysis which accounts
for analogous phenomena, which are remarked in tubes                                 ;
the numerical results of the theory perfectly identical with
those of the observations, perhaps still more exact than
Messrs. Haiiy and Tremery have made expressly in order
to submit the new theory to the most rigorous trial.
   Let no one imagine that these delicate researches                              have
no      other merit       than that      of difficulty overcome,               every
thing holds        in    the physical     sciences      as   in nature herself;
there    is   no phenomenon which, when explained, does not
                                                      throw

thrdw  some new light upon some other phenomenon.
From the new theory there results already the decision of
an important point in meteorology.  Opinions were divided
upon the method of estimating the height of mercury in the
barometer.   The one party reckoned from the base, and thd
other from the summit of the convexity.    This last method
is much less inaccurate, but it still gives heights that are
less than those      which result from the pressure of the atmo.>.
sphere ; the      difference \s the effect of the capillary action.
In   order to correct       it, the author points out two methods               :
one    of which    is   analytical the other, which will no doubt be
                                   ;
preferred   the greatest number of observers, only rests upon
             by
an easy experiment and      very simple and short calculation.
                                  a
By one or other   of  these  means, results will be obtained
more precise,       more certain, and which may be more easily
compared.

                         ANOTHER            NEW PLANET.
JVL. Olbers         has discovered          anew planet, being the second
which we owe to the observations                    of this learned and inde
fatigable astronomer.   The following was nearly its situa
tion:  On the  29th of March at 8h 21m, mean time, 184d 8m;
northern declination, lld47m; on the 30th of March at
12h 33m,     mean time,           189d52m; northern declination,               lla
54m.
     This new planet was found                     and observed       by   Stephen
 Groombridge,       esq.    at his observatory on Blackheath,                 from
 the account transmitted from the Continent.     Mr. Groom-

    There has been lately discovered in the collection of the
  duke of Buccleugh, a curious manuscript of the statutes of
 the Orders of the Garter and the Bath, with various old
 drawings; among the latter are portraits of Richard III. and
 of Anne, his queen. These drawings prove to be the ori
 ginals from which the late lord Oxford's outlines were taken,
 as represented        in his " Historic Doubts," and it is re
 markable,       that the above learned      nobleman was always     of
 opinion that the original was in existence.                  (Historic

    XLIX.     Letter from EZEKIKL WALKER, Esq. containing
           further Remarks on his ntiv Transit Instrument.
                                    To   Mr. Tillock.
    I     SIR,
        N a paper, which was printed
                                                                               v
                                                       in the 25th volume of the
    Philosophical         Magazine,      p. 173, I described a method of
    constructing      an instrument         for observing the sun's transit
    over the meridian upon a much smaller scale than that which
    I Jiad formerly used, yet sufficiently exact for regulating
    common clocks and watches ; but it now appears, from an
    instrument       that has lately been erected according to those,
    directions,      that the method deserves further consideration.
    A gentleman has communicated to me five observations,
    made with this instrument, on the sun's passage over the
    meridian and the greatest difference between any two of
                 ;
    them amounts to no more than one second and six tenths.
    These were the only observations that this gentleman had
    taken at the time he communicated them to me, and not
    chosen out of          a great number : they were taken with a
    chronometer,          which was immediately compared with ob
    servations made             on the same day with a transit telescope.
    Hence I am inclined to believe, that vfith some improve
    ments in the -construction of this instrument, and in the
    mode of using          it,
                     the sun's transit may be determined still
v   nearer the truth.
         When the utmost precision                  is   required,  will be neces
                                                                   it
    sary to protect the instrument                     from the extremes of heat
    and cold,        by
                  laying the foundation of the pier about two or
    three feet below the surface of the ground, and from that
    depth erect  small building over
                     a                  at the distance of eight

    or ten inches, leaving an empty space all round.       This
    building should be carried up higher than the gnomon at
    the south, but   need not be more than six or eight inches
                           it
    higher than the stone upon which the meridian line                   is   drawn
    at the south.
       If the plane on which the line drawn should dip either
                                                         is

    ment will not be affected                bynor will small inclination

 affect the gnomon.    It is therefore necessary to make this
part of the  instrument  adjustable, which may be done in the
following manner:
   Let a triangular stone, resting on three foot screws, be
 placed with one side facing the north and the opposite angle
       to the south ; near the middle of this side the gno
pointing
mon must be fixed to stand directly over the meridian line.
Then, by  means of these screws and a plumb-line suspended
from the top of the gnomon, the right line which passes
through the centres of the perforations iriay be readily set
perpendicular to the horizon.   The plumb-line must be sus
pended on the south side of the gnomon to pass over two
dots, one made near the top of                       it,
                                      and the otlier near the
bottom, in   line parallel to the line of perforations
                   a                                     and,                   ;
as the    plumb-line will not                 be in the way when observations
are taken,    may always remain attached to the instrument.
                 it
   No light should be suffered to enter the instrument from
the south further than the gnomon, except those rays of the
sun which          are transmitted through                 one   of the small       aper
tures made in           it ;   but at the        north     a   small door must be
made      in   the roof,       to be opened          when the observations are
taken.
   The precise time that the limb of the solar image comes
in contact with     line drawn on
                           a         plane surface, cannot be
                                                     a

surrounds    but am of opinion that this inconvenience may
               ;           I
be avoided         by
               using    different mode of observing.

be taken when   the line bisects the solar image,   will be                it
nearer the truth than when the two limbs are observed.   If
five lines be drawn at proper distances, five observations
may be taken this way in less time than six minutes.

eye would be better able to judge .when the two small seg
ments are equal than when, the whole circle is divided into
two    equal    parts.    I am persuaded that the mean of five ob
servations taken        by this method would determine the time
of  the sun's transit over the meridian to less than a second,
with    a gnomon only three feet high erected upon a stone
three feet in length.
    To illustrate this mode of observing by an
                                   Example,
    If fig.  5. (Plate   VII.)    represent the solar image, and the
distance between the two lines « and n be = los'', the two
segments will be each = 10" when the sun is in the equator,
as he then takes about 1 28" in passing over a space equal to
his own diameter.            Then,     if  an observation be taken          only
 l"  too soon, the two segments will be to each other in the
ratio' of 9 to 11, which may be too great a difference to pass
unobserved.
    When five observations are to be taken by this method, it
will be necessary tohnve seven lines drawn at equal distances;
but the first observation must not be taken until the centre
of    the   solar image be upon the second line, at which
time the first and third lines will cut off two equal seg
ments ; when the centre comes to the third line, the se
cond and fourth lines will               cut off two equal            segments ;
and the third, fourth,          and   fifth observations must be taken
in the     same     manner.       If  these lines be drawn at such di
stances     that the centre       of the solar image may              take about
 54 seconds      in passing from one line to another when the
 sun is near the equator, the five observations may be taken
 in less time than four minutes.
    This instrument, though erected at a small expense, is
 infinitely more convenient for keeping the rate of a clock
 or a chronometer than either Hadley's sextant or the astro
 nomical quadrant, and perhaps superior to either of them
in point of accuracy. — I am, sir,

 1  will   now beg to be indulged with your attention to an
 other subject, which        some circumstances of the times have
 led me to reflect on.       I mean the present enormous price of
foreign   wines.      It may   possibly occur to some of vou, that
 this subject, however serious in a national point of view, is
not amons: those which such a society as oars can hope to
take up with success; and even, that it is not among those
 subjects most properly cognizable by our institution ; that
foreign wines may be considered, which frequently has been
the case by the legislature, as an article of luxury, but little
connected with the comfort of the great body of the people.
To these possible objections I am prepared in part to assent ;
and   T would not lightly ask attention to a subject of doubtful
propriety. But my views are not directed to wine as a luxury,
or  to an interference with the taste and habits             of  persons     of
sufficient wealth to afford the prices which are now paid for
the different kinds of foreign wine.              From all present ap
pearance,    a  sufficient  number     of  those   persons will be found
to purchase whatever may be importable from the foreign
markets, at whatever shall be the current prices.                  I propose
to consider the real use of wholesome wine for medicinal
purposes, and those of general comfort, frugally used among
the middle and lower ranks of the community. It is allowed,
and justly, that for the laborious classes the refreshment of
sound malt liquor is the common article of the country;
and that no substitute for that, or the wholesome unadulte
rated eider    of some' districts,    is cither to be expected        or pru
dently sought for.         But it   is to be considered that there are
innumerable cases in which            some     refreshing vinous liquor,
different from these, is frequently desirable, for the comfort
of persons. in delicate situations and states of health, who
cannot afford the expense of even a very little foreign wine;

many of whom, from motives of what they deem ceconomy,
have recourse to the use of different kinds of spirits, too
often, indeed, in large quantities ; hut among the more cau
tious, even the smaller ones, though diluted with water, are
commonly injurious.      Il is also obvious that the beginning
of this habit of using spirits is too commonly delusive in a
large degree, and insensibly leads on to strong and confirmed
habits    of pernicious drinking, especially in towns                   and cities.
The mischief           to health and          morals is well known to be in
calculable.           The wines commonly sold under                 the name     of
British sweets, and which formerly                  used to be resorted to       in
cases of sickness and weak health,                  are now become so ex
pensive, that even their aid is generally beyond the reach of
the poor ; and it seems probable that the consumption is
chiefly by adulteration of foreign white wines, affording a
lucrative         by mixture, for tavern consumption, and
                   trade,
partly also, in alike mixed state, for private families. Thus
the revenue is considerably diminished by the deception.
This last, though not                an immediate     object of our concern,
may he allowed its weight in favour                  of wh.itwe wish to pro
pose,     as very desirable           in itself, and but in     a   small degree
doubtful with regard to the revenue, i. e. the increased ma
nufacture of family wine from the best of our own fruits.
What          these    are,    or may by management be, is the next
question.            To     the red and white currant, commonly used,
there seems an objection, on account of the acid quality from
which their juice is almost inseparable, except by long keep
ing ; and I cannot but look with much more confidence to
wards the black currant,              abundant juices and salutary
                                        the
virtues       of   which seem to have been too little known. Indeed,
as an   article for wine^ few persons seem to have regarded
it,   though perhaps      will be found to be one of our best
                                it
garden fruits for the purpose in question. There   in this               is

to    amoderate age.              I   am confirmed in this statement by
sufficient authority          /   and perhaps in many cases of sickness,

  292            On the Utility   of making Family Wines
  a,'well   as  for more common use, it has salutary properties,
  which render it more valuable than the public are generally
  aware of. The black currant tree is known to be hardy,
  and in our climate an abundant bearer, by the common
  mode of garden propagation.            But it is well worthy of trial,
  whether it may not be trained against the walls of the gar
  den, and the sunny sides of houses and cottages, with still
 greater success.         From the best accounts I can get, this
 seems    highly     probable   ; and  if so, such abundant propaga-
 tio'n may be at once easy, and largely beneficial for our pur
 pose.     That such       has not been the general practice, is no
 good reason       why,    under   strong recommendation, it should
 not become ss ; and recommendation of useful things, in
 all the departments of culture, is certainly one of the proper
 provinces of this comprehensive society. The best mods of
 making such wine may be more commonly known than
 practised    ;  and at any rate it is as    easy as  any  similar pro
 cess.    I  therefore feel     much confidence of utility from our
 recommending this domestic object. Another fruit presents
 itself to our notice, which, in all countries famed for its
 wines, is of proverbial excellence, i. e. the grape.              1 am
 aware that it is a common opinion that our climate is in ge-
 neral too cold and precarious for the full ripening of the
 grape; and that vineyards, which in various places have
 been attempted, have not succeeded           so as to answer the cost
 and labour of vintage.           I am persuaded that few are the
 situations     in this  island   where   success may be expected in
 open-field culture.         That object, therefore, I cannot think
of recommending.             But experience, and some considerable
observation, have convinced me that much greater success
may be expected than many persons are aware of, in culti
vating the vine in our warmest districts against, the southern
walls of numerous farm-houses, country cottages, and even
in the small gardens of many towns and cities, where the
soil is light and favourable, and that with very easy atten
tion. In cold lands and bleak exposures it would be a fruit
less attempt,       and common reflection would point out the
absurdity.       But  in some parts of the county of Essex, though
Jess favourable to its success than in other spots of our
                                                                island,

              front-several   of our Garden Fruits.            293
 island, particularly in Devon and Cornwall, I have known
vines so abundantly and successfully wall-trained, as to pro
duce, for private families, an ample supply of most pleasant
and valuable wine. Indeed the practice is so common among
 the cottagers and others inhabiting   houses built of brick, that
at the   ripening season many poor and middling people are
 in the habit of selling large quantities of grapes, at very rea
 sonable prices, to their more wealthy neighbours, for the
purpose of making wine.        And it is not easily conceivable,
by strangers to the practice, what quantities of useful and
pleasant wines are made in warm summers from these sources,
and that at an easy expense.       The fruit, indeed, cannot be
expected   to be uniformly ripe and excellent, but by far the
largest part of the bunches are generally good, and fit for
use; and those who have been most in the habit of the ma
nufacture, and can afford to keep the wine by them for years
in succession, well know that the improvement by meliora
tion of time is sufficiently remarkable arid encouraging. As
 to the benevolent uses to which such wines may be occa
sionally applied among the poor and sickly of a neighbour
hood, little need be said to recommend the practice.          It is
sufficient to say, that this species of useful benevolence is
known to be excited by the cheapness and ease with which
families in sufficient affluence become possessed of a mode
rate store by their own (Economy and provident exertions.
I  would therefore submit to you the propriety of our recom
mending; a more general attention to this domestic object
than our part of the nation seems to be acquainted with.
The risk is small indeed; no land, useful for the purpose
of a°riculture,   need   be encumbered     with it.  The trial is
easily made.     The   success may be at once pleasing and     be
neficial ; and examples     of such  success, though gradual in
their evidence, may become in process of time extensively
and lastingly influential.

    I shall now lake the liberty of annexing a letter on the

                                                  isiewonh, Jan.   24, IBO*.
  " I           your letter, some days ago, respecting the
           received
wines that may be made from the natural fruits of this coun
try, which I should have sooner answered, could I commu
nicate any thing of the importance I wished ; but that not
being the case, I felt a great reluctance at the thought of
troub'ing you with any thing not satisfactory.
   "   1   can say little else than that, from our own experience
for   a short time past,    and what    I   have seen   of others, I am
                 that wine may be made from our native
perfectly satisfied
       —
fruits; red and white currants, gooseberries, blackcurrants,
raspberries, and other fruits, (with the help of sugar,) as
good, and of as rich a flavour in all respects, as any that ar&
imported from abroad. But the particulars in the process
that may vary the qualities of the wine, where the ma
terials are the same, are so numerous, and the time that
must elapse before the result of any experiment can be
known is so great, that I despair of living to see any cer
tainty established on this head.  At present, I sometimes
taste as good wine     of   that sort as could be desired, and again
as bad as can be thought of, made by the same persons, when
they can assign no reason for the difference. From our own
limited practice 1 have been able to ascertain only two points
that I think can be relied upon as tolerably well established :
These are, first, that age, I mean not less than three years,
is required to elapse before any wine that is to be really good
can attain such excellence as to deserve the name of good ;
and second, that it never can attain that perfection if spirits
of any kind be mixed with it. I apprehend that most of our
made wines are greatly hurt by not adverting to these two
circumstances.
   " Another circumstance that          is,
                                      in my opinion, very ne
cessary for the formation of good wine of this sort,     cer   is   a
tain degree of acidity  in the fruit, without which  the wine
never acquires the zest which constitutes its peculiar excel
lence, but hurries forward too rapidly into the state          of vine-.
                                                                        gar.

gar.   Currants at all times possess enough of that acidity;
but if gooseberries be too ripe they are apt to want    and                             it,
become insipidly sweet at an early period, though they soou
become vinegar.       ought to be remarked, that the native
                                  It
acidity of the fruit  different from the acidity of vinegar,
                                   is
and possesses qualities extremely dissimilar.   The sourness
of vinegar, wlien    has once begun to be formed, continues
                                it
to augment with age but the native vegetable acid, when
                                     ;
combined with saccharine matter,    gradually diminished   is
as the fermentation proceeds, till     totally lost   the it    is                      in
vinous zest into which both this and the sugar are com
pletely converted before any vinegar produced,   the fer    is                     if
mentation be properly conducted.
   " This, believe,    I  new opinion, which experience
                                         is   a
alone enabled me to adopt not very long ago. But   have                                 I
had so many experimental                      proofs of this fact, independent
of      the support        it   derives    from reasoning, that      am satisfied

it      is   well founded.         I     am satisfied further, that the wines of
this country are debased chiefly not adverting to     by
                                                     and                                it,

degree            of attention.

                              ;
mark that   the native acid of fruit undergoes similar change            a

 2Q6              On the Utility   of making Family Wines
 tons process, and to give         that degree of strength which will
 entitle it to the name of a cordial liquor,  certain portion of
                                                         a
 brandy is added to        after which
                            it,           may be kept for some
                                                   it

                                                             a
 lutary process of fermentation which was going slowly for
 ward, and gradually maturing the native vegetable acid into
 vinous liquor, which being at last blended witft the saccha
 rine vinous        juice, produces       that warm          exhilarating         fluid
 which     cheers the heart and invigorates the strength                    of man.
 In   this way, the sharp, insipid, and poor liquor which was
                        slow process, which requires
                        by
 first tasted, is,      a                                great              a

                                  converted into rich pleasant
wine,  possessing, in     great degree,
                            a                       that high         zest which
constitutes its principal excellence.
,   "     My experience    not yet enable me to speak with
                            does
certainty respecting all the circumstances that may affect
the flavour, or augment or diminish the strength of wine,
or accelerate or retard the time of its ripening.   But my
opinion at present         is,
                         that  great part of the flavour of
                                      a
wine depends considerably upon the skin of the fruit, which
may be augmented or diminished                 by
                                        the degree of pressure
the fruit    is
            subjected to, and other particulars connected with
it; or    the macerating the fruit more or less in the juice
           by
before the skins be separated from the pulp; and that the
ultimate qualities of the wine are considerably affected                            by
the proportion of the original native acid of the fruit con
joined with the saccharine part of              the     juice.       It   seems     to
me very evident, also, that the saccharine juice can be more
quickly brought into the state of wine than the acid portion
of  it,and that of course those wines that consist entirely of*"
saccharine matter, flavoured only             by
                                    some pleasing vegetable
perfume, such as cowslip or elder-flower wine, and others
of similar sorts, may      be sooner brought to be fit for                drinking
than those  in which the juice of fruit form     considerable    a
ingredient, and may   be also made  of    weaker  and lighter
                                                    a
quality.   And that fruit wines, in proportion to the dimi
nution of       the quantity     of fruit   to that   of sugar, or in pro
portion to the quantity of acid in the              fruit, may be accele
rated or retarded in the progress of fermentation                    ;    but that
stroog full-bodied       wine,    of good flavour, must              have   a   con
                                                                          siderable

  a long while before it can attain its ultimate perfection.
      "  I have had too little experience in the practice of making
  grape wine to enable me to speak with precision.             The fla
  vour of different kinds of grapes, we know, varies considera
   bly, which must affect the wine; but other circumstances
  in the process must affect it greatly. It is the only fruit
   known in this country that affords juice in abundance suf
   ficient to admit of being made into wine without the addi
  tion of water, or rich enough without the use of sutar. Two
  years ago the season was so favourable that my grapes (the
   muscadine) ripened- completely, and I determined to try to
  make some wine of them svithout either sugar or water. The
  juice was squeezed out by hand without any other pressure,
  as I had no press. It fermented very well, and after a proper
  time it was tried.        The liquor   tasted sweetish, but wanted
  much of     the vinous zest we wished for.      This  arose,   I have
   no doubt, from the want of a due proportion         of  native acid,
  which would have been probably supplied by a complete
   pressure of the must, had I possessed the means of doing it;
   especially it the bunches of grapes had not been separated
  from the small foot-stalks to which the berries adhere.           But
.  not having    a  quantity  sufficient to make it worth while to
   have a press,    I thought of another method of attaining the
  end    I aimed at, to which I was forced to resort : on finding
   that birds and vermin are so greedy of the grape, that it is a
   matter next to impossible to preserve them for any time here
   in quantities after they are ripe without being broken, which,
   by letting the juice flow out, lodges between the berries in
   the clusters, and which       there  becomes   mouldy, and com
   municates a musty taste that cannot be gotten rid of.
       "   To avoid all those evils, I determined to gather the
   fruit when it is so far ripened only as just to begin to be
   pecked by the birds.       As the juice possesses at that time
  more vegetable acidity and less of the saccharine taste than
  when fully ripe, I conceive that the wine made from it will
   be sharper and have a higher zest than the other ; but dread
   ing that   the juice might not be sufficiently matured      to do by
   itself,  I added a portion  of sugar and water   to the  juice, and
                                                                   have.

              On the Utility       of making Family Wines.
 have put it by for trial.           It fermented well, and the liquor
 has at present as promising an appearance as I could wish.
 Should HI;- mode of making grape wine succeed, it will be
 by far the cheapest wine we can make in this country ; for
 the quantity of juice yielded by the grape is so much more
 abundant, and so much richer than that of our other fruits,
 and it is so much easier to be gathered and otherwise ma
naged, that it must be much more desirable. The quantity
 of fruit produced, too, is so much greater when the vines
are properly managed,          than can be gotten from the same
extent of ground of other fruits,           as to give   it a decided pre
ference on the whole.            I have just now in my cellar about
forty gallons      of  that  wine     made from the grapes that were
gathered from a wall of about fifteen yards in length, and
fifteen feet high.       Nor was that        a crop above the average.
Neither had that wine above half the quantity of sugar that
other fruit wines would have required.                  I have no doubt
that were vines raised           from seeds    of  the best and earliest
sorts, and carefully selected when they come to bear, we
might thus obtain a grape that would ripen very well in this
country without the assistance of a wall.              It is by no means
improbable      that  such  a  vine    was once  known      in England.
    "  Next to    the vine,   I   agree with you in thinking that the       .
black currant is the best       fruit we have of that kind for making
wine.     I have seen     some of it that was truly excellent.          It
would be of great use for giving flavour to some other wines.

      Lava. Read at the Meeting of the Physical and Natural
      History          Society    of Geifeva,       on the 11tli   of April 1806.
      By M. G. A. DuLcc*.
    VOLCANOES hold such          a remarkable place among terres
    trial phenomena,    that they have become the subject of a mul
    tiplicity of conjectures upon their origin, influence, and the
    geological consequences which might be drawn from them.
    Wherever they            were put     in requisition     in order   to found a
    system upon them, they have        made to act that part
                                                   been
    most convenient for their authors.  In this manner they
    have seized upon a simple and isolated fact, the only one                    of
    its kind which has no relation except with the soil occupied
    by the volcano and its environs.     Several naturalists and
    geologists, although a volcano only resembles mountains
    of its own species, and does not at all resemble other
    mountains, cither in form, construction, or the substances
    which compose                it,   have   concluded     that the layers and
    mountains          on the surface of the earth            owe their origin to
    the action of fire; that element,                as   they say, presenting us
    every day         with productions entirely similar            to the primitive
    rocks of the globe.
       From this     results that these naturalists regard the dif
                        it
    ferent crystals inclosed in lava, not as productions in the
    humid way, anterior to the lava, and which existed in the
    layers reduced into fusion                by
                                   the volcanic fires, but as cry
    stallizations formed in the lava itself, and of its own sub
    stance,       by   the slow cooling       of   the mass.
       It   chiefly upon this opinion that M. Fleuriau de Belle-
            is
    vue       founded the system he has adopted and published
            has
    upon the action of the fire of volcanoes and upon the forma
    tion of the terrestrial globe, of its layers and its mountains,
    inserted in the Journal de Physique for May 1805.
       Let us reduce this question to its most simple term, viz.
    The crystals which lavas contain, have they been formed in
      •  This    second paper by M. de Luc on this subject. The first paper hai
                 is
                  a
    already appeared in th^ Philosophical Magazine. — Sec our hit Number.

 formed anteriorly,                by   the humid      way,  in the  substances or
 layers which the volcanic fires have reduced into fusion                                     ?
,From this inquiry, deduced from the true state of things,
 and carried        by
                facts to degree of evidence beyond all un
                                        a
certainty,      a   question will be decided                     of important conse
quences to geology,                     by   presenting    a   just idea of volcanoes
and their phaenomena.
     The principal       argument of M. Fleuriau de Bellevue                                  is
drawn from           the connection which he finds between the
formation of crystals contained in lavas and the species of
crystallization which has been called crystallites, and which
.are formed in the glass-house pots when in                           a   state   of fusion,
 and afterwards slowly cooled.
     We shall now examine what                            these glass crystallites are.
The entire mass of cooled glass presents   confused crystal       a
lization all of the same colour, in which we see small com
pact bars confusedly interwoven, some of them slightly stri
ated and others disposed in stars equally confused.                                At other
times there     is      formed          at the   bottom of the crucible           a   multi
tude   ofthreads which cross each other, and also present
starry forms.
   In the lirst case, these crystallites compose even the mass
of the glass, and are only distinguished in some places; in
the second, there are seen,through the transparency of the
glass, these heaps                 of
                               and star-like forms, which
                                         threads
have some connection of form with the small stars of ice
which fall along with the snow in strong frost. Perhaps    a
we   see      examples of vitreous crystallizations more de
            some
cided but this case, which
       ;                         rare, only proves that there
                                                 is
may  be such   circumstance
                    a        as favours  this crystallization in
a very small space.
   M. Fleuriau dc Bellevue finds that these crystallite forms
singiilarly resemble the tremolite.   This opinion, that there
exists     singular
           a        resemblance   between  two substances, of
which      the one production of
                         is   a    vitreous nature, and the
                                                      a
other of mineral layer,
            a           astonishrs me,    must confess  for     I                     ;
in that case there  no substance which we might not assi
                              is
milate to another,            if    it   only has     a   relation to     it   in point of
                                                                                      form.

                   crystallized Bodies contained in Lava.                     301
form.         Thus we may         say that capillary schorls, or mineral
asbestos, resemble          cotton or linen threads, although between
these two substances            there is merely a resemblance           of form,
without any reality.            This remark was necessary, because
one might think from the expression " singularly resemble"
that there is something more than a mere appearance.
    The tremolite, which            derives its name from       Val-Tremola,
near St. Gothard, one of the principal places where it is
found, is a radiated mineral substance, the threads of which
are often of a brilliant white, and united in sheaves or bun
dles. These sheaves issue from one centre and diverge in a
round form,           which gives them the form of a radiating star ;
and, these centres being varied, from                  this there results dif
ferent directions          in the rays, the length of which is from
half an inch to three inches and upwards. This mineral
substance is one of the most curious and agreeable to look
at.      It   is sometimes       mixed with talc and calcareous spar,
i. e. of two substances,            one of which is vitrescible, but of
difficult fusion, and the other is calcinable                ; a circumstance
which of itself excludes the idea of the least relation between
the tremolite and the produce              of  the glass-houses     : and when
we compare these products with the                   brilliant  threads    of the
tremolite,         which, taken by themselves,            have each the form
of    a  four-sided prism,         we   must   be   astonished    that such an
assimilation ha, been made. The tremolites are vitrescible
but not vitrefied, and never were so.
     Let us, however, turn our attention                 to such crystallized
bodies inclosed in lava to which the vitreous crystallites have
been assimilated.            I can make this comparison upon a great
number of pieces, which               I  collected in burning and extin
guished volcanoes.
     The     lavas which contain leucites, or white granates, also
 frequently contain pyroxene volcanic schorls, and crysolites
 or olivincs *.          Here there are two kinds of crystals, very
 distinct from each other by their form and colour, contained
in the same lava, surrounded by the same crust, which in
    •  I shall  afterwards designate these schorls by the name of pyroxlne schorls,
because     the simple denomination of pynxbics does not belong to them exclu
 sively; all the bodic* contained in lavas    being also pyroxenes, i. e. strangers
 to fire,
                                                                             itself

                             Observations upon the
itself    lias   no relation to them,             either in its nature, colour,
nor chemical properties, as                   we shall soon see.
  The form of the leucites and pyroxene schorls is perfectly
determined ; nothing is confused, all is precise and well cha
racterized. The leucite is constantly of a round form, shaped
into 24 trapezoidal faces, and of a whitish gray colour; the
pyroxene schorl is an octaedral prism with two biedral* py
ramids of a deep olive colour, and sometimes black : the cry-
solite is of the colour of a peridot. These three crystals are
found in the spongy and cellular lava, as well as in the com
pact lavas.
     The schorl is           so strongly United to the lava that it cannot
be detached   from             it,
                       nor appear with the polish of its faces
and the distinctness of its angles, unless  chemical opera      by   a
tion produced            by
                   the sulphurous acid fumes of the volcano.
The leucite    more easily.separated, leaving upon the lava
                   is
a distinct impression of its round shape.   Its impressions in
the lava may be compared      to those left   granates, cubical  by

                           the humid way.
   From this the following conclusion results That the leu               :
cites are no more a formation produced in the Java at the
moment of its cooling, than granates and pyrites are forma                       a
tion extracted from the substance of the rock which contains
them when        dried and hardened. Both equally are fo
                   it   is
reign to the substance which contains them, and have existed
before     the leucites before the lava, and the granates and
          it;
pvrites before the rock which envelops them.                                 We often
found also the leucites isolated, and     great                 in   a           number,
among the volcanic ashes.

mountains,      all of constant and regular form each in its spe
cies.
   The  pyroxeriatert    schorls are also often isolated, and some
times in innumerable multitudes. The crater which opened at
the base of Mount ^Etna in 1669, which elevated a cone of
4300 paces in circumference at its base, from which pro
ceeded the enormous lava which we now see, and the mass of
which astonishes us, shows a peculiarly striking example of
this. The summit of this crater is Covered with these schorls
mixed with small scoriae, with this remarkable circumstance,
that the schorls at the exterior of the crater have all, without
exceptioni retained at their surface a crust of lava which en
velops thern, and that those of the interior show their na
tural polishi
   I shall here explain the cause        of this difference, to which,
I think, I am the first        observer  who has directed    his atten
tion. The sulphurous           acid fumes   of the volcano    penetrate
and   decompose the surface of the lavas and scoriae which
are there exposed, and the schorls which they do not attack
appear at that time, in relievo, in their whole integrity per
fectly cleaned from the lava which environs them, as rock
crystals, covered sometimes with, a calcareous stone, are
sometimes cleaned of it by the nitrous acid, and appear in all
their lustre.     Here is an operation proving that there is no
chemical    affinity between lava and the pyroxenated schorl
it contains,    since the one is attacked      and dissolved,   and the
other is not.      This effect sometimes presents a very curious
spectacle:    it  is pleasing to see ihese schorls of all sizes,
even microscopical,        fixed upon lava, the surface of which
had   been   decomposed, brilliant in their polish and very
sharp at their angles.
   It sometimes happens that the schorls themselves are at
tacked and their colour altered, so that their points appear
like small crystals of sulphur, or of a whiter tint; this ef
fect is produced, without doubt, when the fumes contain
a mixture of acids that act upon the schorl being united,
which they cannot do separately ; a chemical operation, of

which we have a well known     example in aqua regia, coin*
posed of nitrous and muriatic acid.
  To these facts, which prove most completely that these
crystallized bodies are anterior and foreign to the lava which
contains them, I shall add, .as a superabundant proof, a sin
gular accident, found in the ashes which covered Pompeia,
and which is in my collection of volcanic matters.
  It is a leucite isolated from three to four lines of diameter
through       whole crystallization, joined to a schorl, the
              its
greatest part of the prism of which it embraces ; this schorl
ivalso in its perfect crystallization, and each of these cry
stals   has    retained    the colour which is proper to          it   :   we see
by the vestiges adhering to the schorl that these two crystals
have  been enclosed in a reddish spongy lava.      This is not
the only curiosity of that description I am in possession of;
I      another from the same place, not so clean
    have                                                                   as    the
former, because it has retained more lava. It \% also                      a    leu-
cite of the same size, perfectly distinct, which embraces a
small group of schprl, one of which is greater than the two
others which arc joined to it.
  Are these not similar examples to those which frequently
happen to the crystals of the layers formed by the humid
way? These green schorls, or epidotes as they are called,
which       we see enclosed in rock crystals ; these micas, these
pyrites, also enclosed   in this same species of crystal, and the
latter, in its turn, in crystuls of calcareous spar, — junctions
which       indicate   a   succession of formations*              The       green
schorls, micas, and pyrites, have preceded the rock crystal,
and the rock crystal has preceded the calcareous spar. We
aho find junctions of these three crystals in the same order.
Whence this natural conclusion follows, that the pyroxene
schorl has preceded in its formation1 that of the leucite.
   I shall also mention spongy lavas, which show in their
fractures leucifcs partly isolated          and the greater number so
litary, and other,* in groups,            as it happen* to crystals of.
every      kind.    Is this the process    ;   is it what is shown by that
confused heap of crystallites of cooled glass              irt   the melting-
pots of glass-house*       ?
                                                                                We

     We know of no          lava   of ./Etna,   and  I know of    no other*
 "which contain leucites       ;  nor lavas of Vesuvius which contain
 the whitish crystalline          lamina     so abundant in the lavas      of
 jEtna.      This   is a fact to which       those  naturalists who think
 that these crystals are formed in lava ought to pay some at
 tention.      If the leuckes are in reality formed in them, Why
 do not the lavas of /Etna contain them also.} while the latter
 are filled   with pyroxene schorls and chrysolites, which are
 common to them with the lavas of Vesuvius?                    Is this difte-
 tence rather not more naturally explained by the absence of
 the leucite in the beds from which the lavas of TEtna flow?
      We  observe these same varieties           in  the lavas   of different
 volcanoes. Those of Hecla, some large specimens of which
 I have, which were brought by Sir Joseph Banks, neither
 contain pyroxene schorls^ leucites, nor chrysolites, but plenty
 of small white crystalline bodies cleft into pieces) from the
 size of    a hemp-seed to that of a pea, and of an irregular
 form, which have the appearance and the hardness of quartz,
 and which seem to be actually broken from it.
      The lavas of Mount d'Or, an antient volcano in Auvergne,
  contain large crystals of amphibole, or hornblend and feld
  spar, which by their cracks and vitreous reflection show thai
  they have experienced          the action of the "burning lava ; and
  we find in other old volcanoes in Auvergne, pyroxene schorls
  without leucites.
      The small      gravel   of    the   volcanic  lake  of Andernach      is
  filled  with    isolated pyroxene schorls, both whole and in
  fragments.       Do we find in this state the confused rays of
  the cooled glass which form part of the mass of the glass,
  from which they cannot be separated, exdept in irregular
  fractures ?
      Among the facts which I opposed to the opinion of sir
  James Hall, quoted by M. Fleuriau de Bcllevue, an opinion
  which is the same as his, I mentioned a singular eruption of
  Vesuvius which         happened       in 1754.    An orifice   was opened
  near the level of the valley which           separates the present cones
-•f Mount       Somma.        This orifice formed       at the production
  of the lava a grotto fringed by the shootings of melting lava;
  it was amass of scoriae in the form of stalactites, the sprigs
                                         Ua                                 of

306                            Observations         upon       the
of which, interwoven together, of a reddish colour                               and   fall
of hollow bubbles,              were from three to six lines                in diameter.
In    the fractures       of    these sprigs        I found pyroxene schorls of
a perfect crystallization and of a deep olive colour.   These
shootings of lava  show  that the lava was in complete fusion,
and that the sprigs were cooled and hardened the moment
they were separated from it.
   There was here no slow cooling which could have formed
these crystals, nor was there a continuous mass sufficient
to give birth by this means to crystalline forms.    Never
theless there are pyroxene schorls, the most of them even at
the surface of the shootings : Is this not a new proof that
these crystals were pre-existent to the lava?   M. Fleuriau
de Bellevue does not admit this conclusion ; but if we draw
our attention to the fact, we shall find it very probable. The
surface of the sprigs of this singular stalactite and that of
the    interior      of   the bubbles are covered                with   a   multitude of
brilliant points, which              are only        perceived       when the light
shines strongly on them ; when viewed with a magnifying
glass, they look like minute particles of sublimed iron.

de Bellevue,           "   have demonstrated to                       all those who are ac
quainted with volcanoes in activity, that the crystals of leu-
cites cannot be formed except during the slow cooling of the
lava."
     I   am acquainted with                         volcanoes in        a state   of activity;
I    have      given       some    proofs of it               ; and nevertheless         I   draw
from          my observations quite  contrary conclusion.
                                                        a    The
facts     I   have quoted, which are true and exact,  decide  the
question.
     As    to the opinion         of       these two naturalists,!             may add, that
U is wrong in an essential                          point.        Upon what   is the distinc
tion founded which    is made between leucites and pyroxene
schorls and chrysolites, since these three crystals are found
together in one and the same lava ? They are separated from
each other, and from the paste of the lava, by a line equally
clean and distinct           as    the small flints which compose a pud
ding-stone           are separated from each other and from the paste
which joins them.   If one of these crystals is foreign to the
lava, the two others are so also : this is a rigorous conse
quence. The fact is rather completely certain that the whole
three are foreign to it.
    The two examples                   I   have        mentioned of isolated leucites,
each      of which envelops pyroxene schorls,                              is a tact inexpli
cable in the hypothesis of the formation of these crystals                                      liy
fire, while nothing    more frequent or more easy to con
                                  is
ceive than these mixtures among crystals                                 of different    species
by     the humid way.
    "    I    should never         finish my observations,"                       M. Fleuriau
de Bellevue proceeds,                  "    if
                                            I         related all the objections which
present themselves against the system of the pre-existence
»f crystals in lava: we find several of them, under the arti

History, where M.                 Patrin has strongly combated these sup

tions, which rarely lead to any thing else than error.
     I    shall call to       M. Fleuriau            de Btllevue's         recollection          a
very remarkable lava of the antient volcanic mountain of
Vituba. This lava contains a multitude of leucites, from
the size     of a     large pea to that          of a grain of rapeseed. These
leucites have undergone a                    sort of calcination, which renders
them very white; and the lava which contains them is black;
which makes a very singular contrast between the two sub
stances.         Is   it not evident that all these leucites existed                       pre
viously to the lava               If we
                           reject this conclusion, we might,
                             ?
with equal propriety, contend that every foreign body whatr
ever contained in a rock has not existed previous to that
rock.
     The leucite       does not resist the action                of   fire and volcanic
vapours in the same degree as the schorl does : the volcanic
vapours seem to have almost as much hold upon it as upon
the lava; at least, none of the specimens in my possession,
ypon being exposed to their action, showed any leucite well
preserved. But it retains its characteristic form in the midst
of burning    lava.   When the heat is carried to a higher de
gree,  it may  soften            it,
                          and cause     to undergo    sort of cal

cination     ; then falls into shivers, and the substance of the
                 it
lava penetrates the leucite                  by   the fissures       whence
                                                                happens
                                                                 ;              it
that we see in its interior             small parcels of lava, which are
distinguished          by   their black or brown colour and small bub
bles   but the form of the leucite
         :                                             is   preserved,      and      is   not at
all altered, because, the lava enveloping                            it   intimately,        no
part of its surface can be separated from it.                  This     the caseis
of   the leucites      of   the old lava          of Viterba; and we see upon,
the piece     I   have,      several         indentations of leucites with the
impression of their           faces.          The lava and the leucites coming
together from the fires of the volcano, the lava ought to be
there in    degree of fusion greater than when
             a                                    flows out                it                 ;

more easily into the crevices of the leucites.
     Jt   has been said       that the lavas which have flowed out ra
                                                                                          pidly

pidly contain no leucites, and that those which have run
oul slowly contained them.   This is a mere ideal distinc
tion ; because, By what sign can we ascertain that one lava
has flowed rapidly and the other slowly    We should be very      ?
much embarrassed to determine it in a certain manner; and
besides, What change can be produced in the substance of a
lava by the more or less rapidity or slowness of its course ?
   The following is a very remarkable fact related by M. Do-
lomieu : — " The isolated leucites are so abundant in the en
virons of Rome, that it may be said that the road to Frescati
is covered with them ; the rains wash them down and col
lect them in large quantities in the ditches by ihe side of the
road."         At   the end       of this fact M. Dolomieu                     presents some
conjectures            upon the origin  and formation of leucites, in
which,        I think,      he   wrong; but he
                                  .is              very far from think
                                                             is
ing that they are           formed of the matter of lavas.
 I       have never                place, but
                           seen this singular   am      pos                  I          in

Civita-Castellana  all their surface was sprinkled with
                            ;                                                                          a

leave the carriage.               How could          we conceive that this multi
tude     of isolated leucites            in   the environs        of      Fre-u-ati have been
formed        from        the    substance       of the lava which contained

310                     Observations     upon   the
 of  salts or sulphur by sublimation, and never any crystal            of
 a solid matter, such as those contained in lava,
     In order to found this opinion he fixes upon two epochs :
 the first took place, according to him, in the crater itself,
 upon the occasion of a former cooling; and the second epoch
 took place outside the lava itself.          A former cooling in the
 crater ! Supposing we should admit this supposition.               Here
 is a lava  cooled and hardened.          But in  a lava which has at
tained this state,    not one of the bodies it contains can be
 any longer separated from it in an isolated manner ; for this
purpose it would be necessary to replunge it iqto the fire of
 the volcano,    or perhaps it would not enter into fusion.
    The crystals which are found isolated upon the cone                of
the cuaters     have   been   separated in the very bosom of the
volcano by the boiling which the lava in fusion undergoes,
and    the squirtings of its explosions.           The crater opened
 upon ^Etna in 1669 shows a very instructing example of
this.     The very large cone elevated by this orifice is covered
with an innumerable multitude of pyroxene schorls, all of
them, without exception, covered with a slight crust of the
Java which contained        them     mixed among the scorite which
contained the latter themselves.            This laya, from the first
moment of its fusion, could not have been cooled for            a single
moment,      yet  here   there   are a multitude     of crystals  issued
from the crater ready formed : Is it possible they could have
been so formed by a former cooling of the lava ? The enor
mous mass of this lava which has issued from the foot of
the cone      contains    itself   a  prodigious quantity of these
schorls, all the traces of them are distinguished upon the
surface of the fractures.
    This same lava, and the jets of its explosions, present an
other interesting fact.        It contains, besides the pyroxene
schorls, a multitude of small crystalline flakes of a whitish
colour, which have no regular form, and seem to be nothing
else than the shitling particles      of  a substance, which are pro
duced by the heat.         These flakes are also isolated, mixed
with schorls and small scoriae.           Can we here discover the
play of affinities   to  which    is attributed  the formation of the
                                                               crystals

              crystallized   Btdies contained in Lava.            311
crystals contained in lava, when, they have no regular form ?
Besides, the play of affinities cannot take place unless when
the molecules upon which they act are at liberty to unite
themselves     ;  which could only take place in fluids in a state
of perfect liquidity. This is not the case with the lava*, m
the heart of which, it is said, these affinities are exercised*
They are certainly in fusion, but it is a dull and heavy fu
sion, which has no progressive motion, except upon rapid
declivities,    or by ihe successive impulse given by the matter
which    comes     out of the volcano pushing it forward and
driving   aside   those   which precede it.     How could the affi
nities exert themselves      upon  such  a  mass ?
   The burning substances thrown out by the explosions of
the crater, some of which are drops of compact lava, and
others are fragments torn from the lava in fusion, at that
time full of bubbles or presenting a thready substance, also
contain pyroxe-ne schorls, which are shown throughout the
whole of these fragments when they are exposed to the ero
                                                     '
sive action of the vapours of the crater. This action is
sometimes carried so far as to reduce          these   fragments to a
state  of softness almost equal     to that of common flour paste;
and the schorls being then also perfectly well preserved, they
are very easily distinguished by their black colour from this
yellow and sulphurous paste, which on drying resumes some
consistency, hut is easily broken.           I have collected several
pieces in these different states, which are at present before
me.
    We cannot suppose that there had been in this a former
cooling for one moment, since these fragments were thrown
from the cauldron of the volcano at the moment even of the
greatest fusion of the substances it contains.
   ft One of the most natural ideas which would be pre-
Jtented  in order   to resolve so many difficulties,"     M. Fleuriau
dfi Beilevue says,     "  would be to compare carefully the pro
ducts of the volcanoes and the circumstances in which they
are, with the results which the large masses of fire produce,
by means of which we separate, dissolve, concentrate, and
combine the minerals, and cause them to change their form."
                                                               I have

 819        On the crystallized     Bodies contained in Lava.
 I have made this examination ;           I  have compared the produce
 of  the furnaces    of glass-houses       and   those enclosed in lavas,
 and it results from this comparison that the difference is total.
    "    Every thing shows that in volcanoes the depth of their
 furnaces is immense." This is what M. Fleuriau de Bellevue
 says  ;  and he adds,     "  this is the opinion of      M.   de Luc, and
 of several naturalists."
    I  have said, -and I     think, that the       fires of volcanoes are
 of very     great depths, against the         opinion of those among
 naturalists who think that these fires are very near the base
 of the volcano, and who place them in the very cone even
which      rises  above   the ground ; an opinion           so contrary to
 every   phenomenon, that it is wonderful how it could enter
into any man's idea.           But I do not think I ever used the.
word immense, which would indicate a depth which cannot
be    imagined even, and          which     is very far from      my idea.
The depth of a vertical league is a great depth, and I do
not think that the fires of the volcanoes may be much
deeper.      But every thing shows that they have ramifications.
The fragments of natural rocks which they throw out, can
only come from these lateral galleries, from which they are
detached and carried off by the lavas which traverse them.
Another phenomenon also indicates it ; that is, those burning
places    which    are to be seen at the bottom          of  the sea in the
neighbourhood of a volcano in eruption, at the same time
that they are a sign that their fire is not at a depth which
may be called immense.            I have thought proper to dwell
upon this expression, because, from this supposed depth,
theories have been deduced as to the formation of the globe
which have no foundation at all.

T            not until some days after the publication of yonr
4-T    was
last Magazine, that a letter from a friend casually informed
me that, in the Retrospect, vol. ii. p. 418. published on the
1st   of February,      an eminent writer and professor           of mathe
matics      had noticed     a letter of mine in your Magazine for
November last (vol. xxvi. p. l7l) on what I then called Mr.
Hawkes's system of musical intervals, but what Dr. Brad
ley, a gentleman not less distinguished for his knowledge on
this subject than for his medical skill, has very lately in
 formed me was practised long ago, and published, I think
 he said, in Holder's Treatise on Harmony, printed in 1604;
 a learned     work, which I lament not to have seen : but for
 my ignorance of the publication of the remarks in the Re
 trospect above alluded to, and which are preceded by a re
 view or examination of lord Stanhope's essay, with which
 I was alike unacquainted, I should earlier have replied to
 that part of the same, which relates to the proper object of
 temperament, or to the principles mi u-liicli we might to de
 cide, on the pretensions       of different   systems proposed.         Con
 ceiving that the investigations of Dr. Callcott, this learned
 professor, myself, and other persons engaged in the inquiries
 which the publication of lord Stanhope's essay has happily
 get   on foot*,       are unlikely     to  lead   to   any practical im
 provement, unless these preliminaries or data are truly set
 tled ; on this account I earnestly invite the free remarks of
 the above gentlemen, or of any others, who have considered
  fhe subject, on what I have written and am about to write
 on these essential points ; and, should they happen to differ
  with me, that they wijl carry their reasonings through, to

  the stating of genera] and definite propositions, which do in
 clude the true principles of temperament.
     First, then, I conceive that we may fairly throw out of
 this consideration every thing relating to full performances
 by voices, violins, and other perfect instruments, or those
 whereon each performer can at will, make any gradation of
 pitch, however minute, in order to produce a perfect chord
 with the note of some one other of the performers, who,
 either from taking the principal part in the piece under per
 formance, from the opinion entertained of his superior skill
 (if performing     a  subordinate part,) from the early, firm, or
 loud striking or sounding of his Note, happens to lead the
 harmony in that instance; it being far from universally
true, that the upper parts always attemper their melody, or
leaps from note to note, so as by that means to make har
mony with the bass part ; but it as often happens, perhaps,
that a bass voice or violoncello performer, finds himself
obliged to yield the note which his, perhaps superior, judg
ment and dexterity would have struck, or indeed nascently
did strike, and instantaneously to slide a little higher or
lower, to avoid a false or tempered harmony with some early
and loud soprano, counter-tenor,        or tenor voice Note, or that
of   some instrument      under the same circumstances    : — where
ohligatos for particular instruments with fixed tones, as for
flutes, oboes, &c. are introduced, the occasional tempera-
rnents'in the melodies of the parts, for voices or perfect in
struments, are still further multiplied ; as they are again by
the frequent lowering, and sometimes raising of the pitch
altogether, in performances entirely vocal ; and respecting
which I    feel justified, on  the authority of Dr.Robison, in say
ing that the nicest ears are incapable of judging of intervals
in melody within one-third of a comma (an error which pro
duces a disagreeable      jar in harmony),    and in asserting  that
a  frequent and perhaps perpetual undulation of pitch takes
place in such performances : on all which accounts, the «-
tervals of melody which are actually introduced in such per
formances, probably amount to several hundreds within the
octave ! How absurd, then, to think of limiting such to
twelve intervals within the octave ; notwithstanding that the
                                                               very

            ,            of   the Musical Scale,                          315
very language      of music writers, or        the notation     of music it
self, may be still in that barbarous and unrefined state as to
want the power of expressing more than those twelve sounds;
and that organs and all imperfect instruments are limited to
that, or even to     a smaller number of notes within the octave
—the trumpet, horn, 8tc., for instance               :  and let it be recol
lected, that vocal and perfect-instrument Performers never
have attempted, and I may add never will or ought to attempt,
to execute any system of sounds limited to twelve notes within
the octave, because all such are utterly inconsistent                    with
perfect haimony*, did performers possess the power of ex
actly accomplishing or giving such temperaments, but which
it is evident that they do not. Although the number of tem
peraments, or intervals, necessary for accomplishing perfect
harmony appear thus numerous, in performances where no
tones are actually Jixed, yet it follows, from the excellent
writings of Mr. Maxwell, that, were one of the parts in »
concert, the bass for instance, to be performed on a certain
system     of Jixed tones (which it will be seen is quite con
sistent with perfect chords), that the number of notes would
in this case not much exceed 60 within the octave to effect
perfect harmony, or the avoiding of all temperaments there
in, in modulating through 24 keys. If it should be objected,
that the best performances by voices and perfect instruments
do not always present us with perfect chords, I answer, that
carelessness and deficiency of skill in the performers, to
gether with the want of any common principle or pre-con
cert, on many occasions, as to which part, or note, should
lead the conchords, occasion frequent attempts, by diffe
rent performers, perhaps of the same part or instrument,
 at suiting their harmony, or being led by a different note
or part, whence it is easily perceived that numerous ano
 malies must arise      ;  but after all, these         performances with
 all their defects, many, if not all of which are remediable by
 instructions from such an instrument as I have alluded to in
 page 206     (of which     I  may say more hereafter), are incon-
    • Which is a definite and attainable thing, by the judgment of the ear
 only, of Tastly more value, in the delight it affords, than any temperament of
 harmony whatever.
                                                                     ceivably

   316                On different Temperaments
   ccivably more gratifying to the ear, than any modification!
   of twelve notes within an octave possibly can be.
      Secondly, before we can reason as to the proper tempera
  ments to be applied to the harmony         of the conchords (which
  are seven,  viz. 3d,  III,  4th, V,  6th,     VI,  and  VIII,  within
  the octave), it is absolutely necessary to determine the exact
  number of fixed sounds, which we mean to admit in an oc
  tave : in any one mode or key, practical musicians admit but
  seven notes, yet for the purposes     of modulation, or changing
  of the key, they    have   extended   tlie number to twelve, by
  the admission    of five half-notes marked cither b or *, di
  stinguished   on  keyed instruments by shorter finger-keys ;
 and to this system of twelve notes within the octave, the
 writing of music throughout         the civilized     world is, I be
 lieve, confined,    and almost all the instruments with fixed
 tones which are in use, are adapted to this system ; yet at
 tempts have not been wanting to remedy the glaring defects
 of this arbitrary system, by the introduction of more fixed
 tones within the octave, as at the church in the Temple, and
 the chapel   of the  Foundling Hospital, London, where four
 teen notes   are said to he admitted      ;  in the instruments ma*
 nufactured some      years   ago by Mr. Clagget, of Soho, (of
 whose principles     and  construction I should be glad to read
 some    account,)   where more tones were admitted ; and in
Dr. Robert Smith's harpsichords,             where   21  notes  within
the octave were used: all these being for the        purpose of tetter
tempering the harmony, and not for avoiding all tempera
ments in the harmony, (as Maxwell's scheme proposes,) by
throwing the same into the melody, where ordinary ears
would not be able to perceive them, any more than in per-
formances by voices and perfect instruments, by which last,.
temperaments     of  the harmony cannot be effected,         according
to any system, unless by accompanying in unisons, the fixed
upper notes of an imperfect instrument, which I think no
one would wish to recommend.                         ,•
    Thirdly}  unless the exaqt number of twelue notes in an
octave be assumed for tempered systems of fixed tones, to
adapt them to the musical language and instruments in use,
we are under the necessity, cither     of instructing musicians to
                                                              perform

                                  of   the    Musical Scale t                         „        317
perform on a greater number of finger-keys (or strings of
harps, &c.) than they have been used to, which has not been,
nor is     fear, very likely to be effected or to adapt move-
             it,
              I                                                        ;
able stops,             as   Dr. Smith        and     Mr. Maxwell           have described,
for readily changing the pipes or strings on which the keys
are intended to act, as often as & change of key requires.
Hence we see one reason why lord Stanhope, and numerous
others who have wriiten on the temperament, have confined
their inquiries to twelve notes, or to the dauzeave, as have                              I
ventured to call such                  a   division    of     the septave,       for the sake
of distinction.                We     see also     why the isotonic scale, or equal
temperament, has so many advocates;                                   because    it   agrees ex
actly \vith the imperfect language or notation of music, with
the practice of modulation, and with the dogmas on this
subject, (for confess many of them have appeared such to
                         I
me,) of composers and writers on the elements of composi
tion.
  Fourthly, our inquiries being thus limited to douzeaves,
or systems of twelve fixed notes within an octave,     be                                 it
comes important to consider, that every piece of music                                           is
written, that is, generally begins, and always ends, in some
one key major or minor, which signify, systems of eight
notes above     certain sound, called the key note: thus,
                         a
c,     B,A,G,F, E,D,C,                       the major key of C,
                                        are the notes             in
the last or lowest       being its key note c,bB,  A, G,     bE,  ;         b             F,
D, C,         are the notes in *he minor key of C, and a, G,                                     F,
E, D, C,           B,    A, of the minor key of A, or  minor,              key   of   A
which last, from having none of the    or  notes in its scale,    b    *
  often called the natural minor, or flat key, as the key of
C is        for the same reason called the natural major, or
  major            is
sharp key.    Before   speak of such modulations from the
                                  I
natural keys,       call into action any of the
                             as can             or notes,                    b        *          it
will be proper to show, that whatever intervals are assumed
above the key or lowest notes       or A, as constituting the

the comparison of the usually harmonies. which must be taken
when D, E, F, G, A, and B, become successively the bass
notes, in performing a piece of full music in that key, we
shall find several instances wherein an error                            of a whole   comma
occurs in the harmony, and which cannot be cured by any
arrangement or alteration of the intermediate or half-notes
b or *, because none of these are or can be used in this key,
besides their laying, at the distance of several commas from
the notes which are erroneous, and therefore cannot be sub
stituted for them: thus, in considering or using D as a 3d
below F,          as a VI above F, or as a V below A, &e., we shall
find that         D, for such purposes, ought to have been J^- (in

ably shown that, no septave (or octave, as      called, when            it   is
the key note   repeated at   is
                           top) can be perfect, as lord Stan
hope (p. I9, and others of his essay) asserts his key of                                      C
major to be; but every such contains within itsebf tempera
ments, perhaps equal to or exceeding comma and nothing         a              !
short of neufave, or system of nine notes within the octave,
                a
for each key, both major and minor, can cure this inherent
defect or disagreement between melody and harmony.
   We have next to consider, that composers and performers
                       of modulating into different keys,
are in the constant habit
or   of making                    in their douxeave
                                  at times every note key                             a
note, major as well as minor thus the keys in use are :
not less than 24 in number, but these are     no means of                    by
equal frequency   use    they were,in think prery practical
                                             ;   if            I
musician            would           at once agree,        in
                                       adopting the isotonic or
equal division of the   douzeave, for imperfect instruments                                   ;
and here our inquiries might end but the fact is, that the:
occurrence of these different keys in practice,  very different           is
                                                                                              as

 fts   to    frequency, although the same has never yet been
 ascertained or expressed in numbers, for accurately stating
 their proportionate frequency of occurrence ; and hence, a
 large portion of practical musiciatts or performers on im
 perfect instruments *, as well as professional tuners, reject
 the isotonic system ; and claim, seme to make one key per
fect      (as they improperly call       it), or nearly perfect, and some
 another, without assigning any just or satisfactory reasons
 for their assumptions, as may be fairly objected to lord
 Stanhope, in his very imperfect attempt at obtaining perfec
 tion in his key of C major.
     But further, we ought not merely to know how frequently
 each key is likely to occur, and how long to be used, in pro
 portion to the use of the other keys, in order to make the
 keys proportionally         perfect, in the order in which they are
 likely      to be used ; but     we are required to take into con
 sideration, the frequency with which chords, between inmost
 every two of the notes in the septave, (of which each key
 must consist,) are likely to occur : and this, I humbly sub
 mit, leads to the conclusion on this subject, which I came to
 at p. 176       of your xxvith volume,          to which the learned Pro
 fessor has in the Retrospect (no. 7- vol. ii. p. 420 and -121)
 objected, and whose objections I beg now the liberty of con
 sidering, in a way which I hope that he will not hesitate
 to examine, whatever I may write on this or any other sub
 ject. In p. 420, Mr. Professor, after speaking of logari/hmi
 as the measures         of ratios, or    means     of deciding on the      pre
  tensions of different systems              proposed, says : " The         best
  system       of temperament will         be much       more readily ascer
  tained by this mean" (logarithms) "than by endeavouring to
  determine, as Mr. Farey likewise recommends, the propor
 tionate frequency of occurrence of the several harmonic in
  tervals,"      and   "  advising that the chords most frequently
  occurring       may   be  made proportionally nearer to perfection ;
                        •
     •  It has  been shown,  I hope, that vocal performers and those who use per*
 fret   instruments  have nothing 10 do with this inquiry, all keys btn^ alike
  tn them, whether pitched eiactly from any note in a given ttour.caic, or from
  .viy possible intermcdiute pitch, at a key, as every singer know*.

SCO                 On different Temperaments
because (says the professor), since other chords beside these
must necessarily occur in different parts of every piece of
music, the ideal system now objected to cannot be adopted,
any more than lord Stanhope's, without doing mischief, and
particularly by occasioning transitions, during performance,
from a better to a worse harmony."      How, I ask, are loga
rithms to be applied to determine the best system of tem
perament, but on some principle, previously settled, as to
wherein the perfection of a tempered system consists ? In
the letter alluded to (vol. xxvi. p. 1 76) I mentioned the
principle,  quoted above, which I have endeavoured         more
fully to explain in the previous part of this letter, and which,
it may not be irrelevant to state, was the result of many con
versations with     the   late    justly            Dr. Arnold, and
                                           celebrated
with other musicians,        as    well    of much observation and
                                           as
thought on the subject; and           wherein I meant to include, the
consideration of every conchord                 interval (less
                                            or harmonic
than an octave) which can occur upon each finger-key as a
bass or lower note, as a 3d, III, 4th, V, 6th, and Vf, above
each note, or 72 conchords            in the whole      ; and     my inquiry
goes to the finding, by a very extensive experiment, a scries
of 72 numbers, expressing the order of frequency, in which
the several  chords above named arise in the music in use.
or likely to be in use, if the experiment can be so far ex
tended : these obtained, we should, I think,               (if
                                                  possible,) at
temper   ihedouxeavcso,  that the imperfections oftho conchord*
shall ie in   t/m inverse ratio     of I   heir frequency        of
                                                                  occurrence.
What   other chordi, besides those included above, can arise?
For speak not ofdischords, because their consideration would
  I
so involve the subject as to render all success hopeless and          ;
after all, -the absence of any sensible phenomena, like the
beatings which attend conchords when tempered, renders it,
perhaps, impossible to fix any principle on which their tem
peraments can be regulated    and they may therefore,
                                  ;                    think          I
safely, be left to receive such temperaments, as the fixing of
the conchords may happen to give them. Does the learned
Professor rest his objection, on the supposed inconsistency
of that sound maxim, which             1   quoted   from    Dr. Smith      (as
to worse harmony succeeding better), with the principle                    I
                                                                          have

                                     of   the    Musical Scale.                                      321
have assumed           ?        In this      case, let him reflect              on what          I   said
above,      and        that chords very differently attem
                      consider,
pered* are not, according to the law of chances, very likely
to succeed each other, because the whole attempering must
lie within small limits, and one of the most frequent chords
in occurrence, is not very likely to be preceded or followed
by one of those the most rare of occurrence, and vice versa*
It is the want of agreement with Dr. Smith's maxim, on
which my chief objection to the isotonic system (which the
learned      Professor thinks              the best) is founded, and for ex
plaining      which             I   beg to refer him to Emerson's Algebrat
prob. ccii, and to request of him to consider, what the effect
must be of hearing a Vth (above the bass, or F cliff" note),
beating only once in a second of time, quickly succeeded by
a   III
      beating 11 times per second, a VI 13 times, a 3d 15
times, or perhaps, a 6th beating 18 '.imes per second, and
these perhaps intermixed with 4ths, which beat but    times                              \\
per second        ?        It       is my fear that lord Stanhope's system                           will
furnish  frequent instances, of transitions from perfect Vths
to those beating very considwably, and from the former to
other chords, beating faster perhaps than those stated above;
which induces               me to withhold                  my approbation of
                                                                                        is it,
                                                                                                 until a
complete table                  of all its temperaments                   and beats              before
us, and which      heartily wish that some person, with more
                       I
leisure to spare for these pursuits than myself, would undef-
take. In the remarks at the top of p. 421,        similar over                  a
sight is,
             if
             I mistake not, observable, as     lord Stanhope's            in
essay,      in first fixing the                  notes       by   means    of   a   regular series
of Jiftlis    (tempered               in this case), and aftertvards                   talking       of
adjusting the same notes, to suit the temperaments                                               of the
thirds.   The temperaments of no one conchord ought to be
exactly  the same, throughout the octave, nor ought anyone
interval above the key to be attempered, without taking into
consideration, the effect which the same will have upon all
the conchords above and. below its upper note, according to
the view which                  I     have      taken    of this     .matter.       I   beg to be
    *  have not yet attempted to decide, whether this attempering should be

different conchords will bear.

permitted, before I conclude, to say a few words on what
has fallen from the learned Professor, in the same number,
respecting the Stanhope system (p. 417): and first I would
ask, How is Dr. Smith's system, on vinlunave, to be reduced
to a douzeave for use on the common instruments ? And if
this is not to be done, but the doctor's unmuttlated system
to be used, surely it must be preferable to the isotonic ?
   The test which we find proposed in this page, of the com
parative correctness df different tempered systems, appears
to me useless, and incapable of any decision : if the singer,
or violinist, is to make perfect cliords with the notes which he
hears on the imperfect or tempered                     instrument, are they to be
unisons with            the upper notes      ?    arid with which of those notes,
if   the piece is full       or are they to be true conchords to the
                               ?
bass    ?     In   either case, what result can be expected different,
from what might have been heard on the instrument itself,
without singing or fiddling to it? I cannot doubt but the
learned Professor would, on reconsideration, prefer examining
a table   of the differences of the logarithms, and               of the number
of    beats per second, to any test of this kind.                 And I remain

                 Description        of an improved Hygrometer.                   323
       THE principal objection to the hygrometer                     described    in
 my former paper *, arose from the necessity of shortening
 the beard of the Oobeena hooloo, in order to reduce the scale
 to a convenient            length ; this was to be obviated only by
 giving     the instrument          a circular form, and inventing some
 mode of ascertaining, without difficulty,                    the number      of re
 volutions made by the index.
      A, B, C, D,       (fig.    1.  Plate   IX.)f    is a frame made     of small
 square      bars    of brass      or silver    ;  this frame is soldered       to a
 square plate       B, E,     the edges      of which     are turned up, as re
 presented       by the dotted lines, to secure the index from in
jury.       On     the face of the. plate is engraved a circle (see
 fig. 4.) which is divided into one hundred equal parts : three
holes a,b,c, (fig. 1.) are made through the frame and plate
 in the same direction; the holes a and b are of a conical form
 as represented        by the dotted lines,            and are highly polished
 to lessen friction       :   the hole at c       receives a screw, one end of
which is tapered, and has a notch cut in it with a fine saw,
 which may be closed by means of the sliding ring d.
     The axis e,f, is made of silver wire, very smooth and
 straight, and of the size of a large knitting-needle ; on the
axis a screw is formed by twisting a smaller silver wire tightly
 round it from left to right. This screw should be fourteen
 or fifteen threads in length.                The end of the axis,       f,   is di
vided, and is to be closed by a small sliding ring.                         As this
 is the most important part of the hygrometer, fig. 2. repre
 sents it on an enlarged scale.
      A loop and drop (fig. 3.) is made of fine gold wire, of
 such a size that, when suspended on the screw, it may slide
 along it with perfect freedom by means of the revolution of
 the axis, but not escape from one interval to another by any
 other motion.             Should the loop, on trial, be found too
 large, (as      indeed      it ought to be,) it may easily be closed a
 little   by placing       it on the screw, and pulling it gently by
 the drop      ;  it will then assume an elliptical form, as in the
 figure.      This loop        is intended to register the number            of re-

       The extremes of dryness and moisture are determined                                                  in

                                                  '
  made with different hygrometers.                  An example may not be
  thought superfluous.                Suppose the scale of the hygrometer
  to be 1145, or eleven intervals and forty-five parts; and
  that at the time of observation there are four intervals be
  tween the dial plate and gold loop, and fifty parts shown
  by the index; this wpuld be written 450. Then as 1145 :

      If two     of      these   hygrometers, in which the extremes of
  dryness and moisture are well determined, be compared to
   gether, they will seldom differ ten divisions from each other*;

      In the above description I have confined myself to the
  name by which the grass is known in the Canarcse lan
  guage, viz. Oobeenq. hooloo; but it may be proper to re
  mark that it is the Andropogon contortum of Linnar.us.                    It
  is found in every part of the My soar country in the month
  of January        ;     when it should be gathered, and thoroughly
  dried in the sun before it is used.
      This     grass      appears to be far superior to any other hygro
  scopic substance hitherto discovered.                 In the Encyclopaedia
  Brilanmca        the     scale  of  Saussure's hygrometer is said to con
  sist of 400 degrees, or rather more than one revolution of,
. the index.          The hygrometer here described makes eleven or
  twelve revolutions.              It possesses also the advantage of being
  very portable, cannot easily be deranged, and may be much
  reduced in size, -if thought necessary,               without affecting the
  extent of the scale.

      P. S. It is evident that, though               the principle and scale
  remain the same, the form of th,is instrument may be varied
  so as to render it far more portable and safe ; and this has
  been done by Mr. Jones, who has made several in a very
  superior manner of a cylindrical form, three incites only                ia
  length and one inch and an eighth in diameter.
     * As the observed difference between the compared hygrometers was al
  ways nearly the same, and on the same side, I have reason to think lite dif
  ference mentioned above arose, in a great measure, from the extremes nut
  having been determined with sufficient accuracy.

             Method of preparing                        Coffee as a Beverage.
ALTHOUGH                  coffee     berries do not seem to possess either a
emell or taste which                  is absolutely agreeable before or after
torrefaction,            mankind         have nevertheless            found in the water
which      is saturated           with    principles they contain, partly
                                             the
disorganized             by the action of the fire, something savoury
and delicate         :    this is the reason why the use of coffee has
been            among every people known.
          general                              The use of it
was at first established nmQng the Persians, Arabians, Egyp
tians, Turks, &c.: but it was very difficult to establish the
practice of drinking coffee  Europe, where it was long con
                                              "in
sidered to be dangerous, and contrary to health : many me
moirs were written against it; but time, or rather the good
effects    of this        beverage,          have         buried them in merited obli
vion.
  The antiquity of                its use,         the great numbers who. continue
it,   and no doubt find themselves                            better for   it,   are certainly
respectable       testimonies in its favour.
  The English and Dutch among the Europeans are those                                        by
whom the use of coffee seems to be most generally adopted                                    ;
the Dutch,        as      well     as the     inhabitants of the ci-devant Low
Countries,        where the beverage   in great use, do not, how

ever, prepare        well, although their process admits of some
                     it
advantages.
  The      best kind         of   coffee     is     generally employed in the above
country      ;           carefully managed, and never car
                 the roasting           is

France for making one. We may conceive from this that
their infusion of coffee, besides being well made, is nothing
else than water     with  an infinitely small quantity of the prin
ciples which this roasted grain contains, and from this oeco-
nomy necessarily results the weakness of the coffee used in
this country.
   The Dutch attempt          to rival  the excellent infusions   of
coffee used     in France by drinking a greater number of
dishes, and     which they draw off more frequently than we
do during the day: but this is ridiculous reasoning; and
in my opinion it is no better than saying that, because one
grain of sugar sweetens six or eight grains of tea, .the same
quantity would produce a similar effect          upon one or more
pounds of the same liquid.
                     Of   the Roasting   of Coffee.
   The roasting of coffee properly is a very difficult opera
tion, and to which sufficient attention is not paid, par
ticularly in France.         Some people, under the pretext of
obtatning     coffee  which    they call strong, carry the roast
ing of this grain       so far that they almost char it com
pletely :  in  fact, this  bad method gives a high colour to the
infusions, but it is easy to divine that it is always in an in
verse ratio to the goodness of this liquor : it has neither
that aroma nor that taste which the amateurs of coffee re
quire.    The taste is bitter and sharp, with a very disagreea
ble back taste of empyreuma ; and, in one word, the inten
sity of its colour proceeds only from the solution of some
principles which the fire has developed in coffee by the too
strong roast ing; of which we have already spoken in treating
of its analysis.
   The roasting or frying of coffee generally takes place in
cylinders of plate iron, a kind of vessel well known in Hol
land, and particularly among the grocers of Paris.            They
also make use of an iron kettle, or frying-pan, when they
have   only very small quantities to roast.         In Holland and
the  Low Countries they only employ coal or earth as their
combustibles,      and  the greatest precautions are taken not to
char the grain: for this purpose, it is constantly stirred during
                                                                 the

the whole time it continues on the fire, and until it has ac
quired a clear and uniform brown colour.      Some persons
are in the habit of adding, about the end of the operation,
a small quantity of beer; others use sugar, and it is heated
once more. The former assert that a fat body hinders the
coffee from transpiring,                                  it,
                                          or rather from losing
                                          as they call
its aroma.    The latter suppose that the sugar communicates
to the infusion of coffee   peculiar and pleasant taste, which
                                          a
is in fact that of boiled or partly decomposed sugar.
   When properly roasted and cooled the coffee        put into                 is
tin boxes, which are well closed. The Dutch are also so pru
dent    not to grind
         as          or pulverizeit    except as         it,              it   is   wanted;
because, when kept too long in    state of powder, a                            it   loses   a
portion of its aromatic qualities, and does not furnish to
the infusions those globules of oil which we often perceive
swimming on the surface of the aqueous liquor, and which
are, as they say,    proof of its goodness.

of roasting, none of them have furnished so much oil at the
surface of the grain, while roasting, as that of Java.
   If, as we have already observed, the Dutch and the
Flemings employ too great       quantity of water in the pre
                                              a
paration of coffee,       not less
                                it true that they are the only
                                     is
people in Europe who retain the method of the antient
Greeks for manufacturing these infusions    they know very       :
well that the decoction, or the ebullition, of this roasted
grain,    not
          is     convenient method, and that
                     a                            deprives                it
the coffee of that peculiar flavour which epicures are so
fond of.
     We may         also    remark that, besides                the strong colour        of
the decoctions, the bitter and disagreeable taste which we
distinguish in them, they are always dull, and difficult to
clarify.   The infusion, on the contrary,     an operation           is
which consists in pouring upon coffee, supported       filter                   by   a
of paper not sized, and more commonly of woollen stuff,              a
a sufficient quantity of water at 86 degrees of temperature                                  :

 of volatile aromatic oil;       and the second, in order that the
 external air may not carry off too speedily the caloric from
 the water, and that it may dissolve more easily the principles
with which it may saturate itself in passing over the coffee.
     If,  after what we have said above, we compare the         liquor
 proceeding from this last operation with that which results
 From an equal quantity         of water and coffee boiled together,
 we shall find that the infused liquor also possesses a perfect
 transparency, is of a very agreeable flavour, of a sweet taste,
 and     that it possesses,   in short, all the properties which we
 require     in this  beverage.
     The decoction, on the contrary, which is not aromatic,
 and is disagreeable to the taste, always preserves the muddy
 appearance which we have already mentioned. In order to give
 transparency, recourse has been had to methods which still
 more diminish the qualities of it : in fact, we know that fish
 glue, or even albumen, may by their mixture with this liquor
 clarify it very speedily ; but what all the world perhaps has not
 observed, is this, that, independently of the bodies suspended
 in coffee, and which darken the appearance of~it, the gelatine
 or   the albumen envelops the little       oil, which floating upon
 the infusion or decoction of coffee, gives it a slight smell, or
  rather it is taken up by the depurating matter.          The filtra
 tion    of coffee would certainly     deserve  the preference,   if the
 infusion, by pouring          boiling water upon coffee supported
 on    a  woollen strainer, did not answer better than the decoc
 tion of coffee, which ought to be rejected.
     There is one observation as important as the former, which
  occurs in the preparation of coffee by decoction, and applies
  against this bad practice : it is also Grounded upon the pro
  perty generally possessed by the extractive matter of vegeta
  bles, of decomposing the air of the atmosphere and com
  bining with oxygen, with which it forms an insoluble com
  pound, which is 'separated, and precipitated to the bottom of
'the liquor:        it is at first manifested in the form of veny
  slender pellicles, which become thicker and thicker; it is
  also to this phenomenon, or chemical combination, that we
  ought to refer the very perceptible discoloration which the
  decoction of coffe'e undergoes when the ebullition is too

long continued.              It   is evident from this, that the little ex
tractive matter contained in the liquor may be completely
oxygenated ; and for the same reason this insoluble com
position ought to produce, by being precipitated, coffee of a
lighter colour.
     From what precedes it would result, that, of all the me
thods adopted for preparing coffee, there are none superior to
that followed by the Dutch and Flemings ; it should there
fore be preferred, taking care not to fall into an excess as
to the quantity of water they employ : to infuse, but not to
boil the coffee,          is,
                    in my opinion, the true way to obtain
this beverage in an agreeable and wholesome manner.
   In order to obtain this infusion possessed of all the qua

                     susceptible,      preferable to use, in

vessel        which   has been invented for some time.                     It  is  a    kind
of coffee-pot, of silver or tin, furnished with                       a   cock     ;   it   has
an interior reservoir pierced with     great number of small

and the amateurs have long ago decided, that there is no other
way    of obtaining it endowed with the most             agreeable and
pleasant flavour.
    M. Disjonval, who lived a long time in Holland while the
French troops occupied the camp at Zeist, was desirous of
 habituating the soldiers to the use of coffee : he attempted to
 prepare a quantity of it so large as to supply the consump
tion of an army of 20,000 men which was then encamped
near Utrecht : for this purpose he contrived a coffee boiler of
extraordinary dimensions; he even prepared the coffee with
cold water, in order always to have a supply of it before hand ;
but he soon perceived that, independently of the weak action
of   a cold liquid on such substances as are submitted to its
influence,      the infusion of coffee was much weaker in prin
ciple, less aromatic, and that it required a second operation to
bring it to the degree of heat necessary for using it : he also
observed that this new method was always hurtful to the good
qualities of the coffee ; from which he concludes with good
reason, that coffee,       like many other things,    when it is again
heated,     loses its value considerably.
    The berries of the coffee tree are not the only part of the
fruit which furnishes an agreeable liquor. Some travellers
in Arabia Felix relate that the king of Hyemen, as well as the
governors of his states, use only the envelope of the fruit
of the coffee tree and the membranes which cover the ber
ries ; which they roast.          This beverage, in great estimation
among      the  Arabs,  is  said to be more agreeable and more deli
cate   to the taste than that which is prepared with the seeds
of   coffee   : the above is wh'at is called in the East
                                                              " $ultan
coffee."
    If, as we have already seen, the Dutch and the Flemish
possess the true art       of making coffee, they   are also, perhaps,
the first who have endeavoured to render this kind of beve
rage of general use in their own Country, and who at the
same     time have tried the most methods           of obtaining it  at
little expense.

tively the process employed in the preparation of this root
in one of the above manufactories, I shall here describe it.
  The succory is          in the beginning of spring ; the
                                gathered
roots are then very thick, well grown, and tender : when
carried to the workshop they are stripped of their leaves and
washed, in order to take off the earth which adheres                                        to
them; they                             or six parallel slips*.
                            are then cut into four
Being thus prepared,  they are cut into very minute portions
by means of a very ingenious machine, which consists of a
wooden trough, respresenting an oblong square, which is
filled with roots, and to this trough is adapted a large knife
with    a lever             handle   :    there is also a press-vice attached         which
pushes out the roots as fast as they are cut, so that, by means
of this mechanical invention,                            one man can cut in an hour
what ten men could scarcely                           do'   in   the same time by the or
dinary methods.
   This machine is analogous to the straw-cutter ; it is si
milar in every respect to that which is used for cutting the
tobacco to which the name of Virginia is given, and so
much esteemed      by smokers.      They proceed afterwards to
dry the root : for  this purpose it  is carried to a kind of kiln,
in which there are compartments or cases of masonrwork,
from                long by five broad, covered with large
           15 to 18 feet
bricks pierced with different holes, and forming an enclosed
plane of about 70 degrees.    The number of these compart
ments,         as       well as the extent            of the kiln, is always propor
tioned         to the means                   of   the    manufacturer.         This kiln     is
heated with coals by means                           of stoves     very badly constructed,
and which are intended to distribute                               the heat into each        of
the cases      in fact, this dryer (for so the workmen call
                                                                                            di it)

  are hermetically closed ; and the atmosphere,            being always
  damp, presents, in my opinion, a great obstacle to the de
  siccation.
     When perfectly dried, the succory root is carried to the
  frying-place: it is here that the operation is almost entirely
  finished; it is roasted like coffee in large plate-iron cylinders,
  which are turned continually, upon a very strong turf fire,
  which soon    reduces it to a charry state.       It is also the more
  or less advanced state of this charring which establishes the
 difference we distinguish in the qualities of this pretended
 salubrious coffee ; so that the three kinds known in com
merce are only the same substance, approaching more or
 less the nature   of the    residue   of  the vegetable     decomposi
tion produced by the action of the fire.            In  order to obtain
 an uniform colour always, the workmen are guided in the
work by specimens which are constantly before their eyes.
     After being roasted, the root is reduced into powder by a
mill   ; the powder is then passed through a coarse sieve, and
distributed    into   parcels  of four, eight, and       sixteen  ounces
each, which are neatly sealed up, and the name of the ma
nufacturer with his place of residence put upon the cover.
This is.the exact manner in which this marvellous coffee is
introduced to the public as a substitute for the true kind.
     Succory root, prepared as we have seen, reduced, in               a
word,     to an almost charry state, is mixed with coffee,
throughout all Holland, in very variable proportions ; it is
also the substance which communicates to the infusions of
coffee that bitterness which is considered as very salutary by
the vulgar, and at the same time refreshing, and as modify
ing the too heating virtues of the coffee. The favourable
ideas thus formed of it have spread so much, that at present
many are contented with this root alone, without the addi
tion of any real coffee at all.        It has been extended to the
French provinces, where there is at present a great demand
for this new produce of Dutch industry : it possesses, how
ever, no other virtue than that of colouring,, more or less
strongly, the water in which it is boiled or infused, and of
communicating        to this   liquid   the  bitterness of the saline

substance the root contains                ;   hut we ought       not to forget to
add that     it   has one great advantage,             of being      at a very      low
price in comparison with that of real coffee.
   Succory root is not the only substance employed for alter
ing coffee, by diminishing the goodness as well as the price                              :
beans, pease, lupines,               &c.   are often employed            :   the culture
of   these last is pursued           even      on   a large   scale in the neigh
bourhood of Mons, Brussels,      &c. for this very purpose.
     In   the manufactorieswhere the succory is prepared as a
substitute for coffee, carrots and beet-roots are also indiscri
minately used.     I saw in Holland a plantation of beet-roots
raised     for the purpose of obtaining                   sugar from them, and
the proprietor informed me, that after he had expressed                              the
juice from         these roots he afterwards converted them into
coffee; and        that turnips and maple fruit had yielded him a
similar result.  It is probable from this that an infinity of
other vegetable substances would serve th,e same purpose,
since it is only necessary to obtain, by a last analysis, the
most fixed products of vegetables, or of their different parts,
still combined           with    small portion

LV.     Notice upon the Existence of Platina in the Silver
     Mines of Guadalcanal, in Estra'madura, in Spain. By
     M. VAUQUELIN *.
JLLATINA   has not been found hitherto, except at Santa-Fe
and in thebailliage of Choco, in South America, among the
gold mines.     There has been a report in circulation, for
some years past, that platina has been discovered in Siberia                               ;
but this report has been as      confirmed as that which was
                                           ill
circulated, fifteen years ago, respecting the existence of in                       it
a  ferruginous sand of St. Domingo.
     Having      lately charged with the task of analysing
                  been
the celebrated mines of Guadalcanal, in Estramadura, (mines'
which, after having             been long        abandoned, are again opened
                    * From Armalcs     de Chimte,    tom. lix. p. 317.
Vol. 27. No.         108.   May        1807-          Y                                  at

336                    Upon the Existence      of Platina
at a different point from the former one,) I recognised in a
variety of these mines tiiJ presence or a considerable quan
tity of platina.        This spix ies of ore is gray, and has a strong
resemblance to thai with which we are acquainted under the
name of gray silver, the fahlerlx of the Germans ; it con
tains copper, ka,L lutiniony, iron, sulphur, silver, and
sometimes arsenic.            Us matrix is generally formed of car
bonate   of lime,      to which sulphate      of barytes and quartz are
united.     1  communicated         this discovery to M. Fourcroy in
October    last   :   this learned     coadjutor, whose genius and
friendship have been          of great service to me for twenty years
past, urged me to verify the fact, which he thought very
important, by multiplied and varied experiments, in order
to put it beyond all doubt.            I took his advice, and the fol
lowing   are the results 1 obtained ; they leave no doubt in
my   own   mind, although I have bten able as yet to operate
up:>n very small quantities of ores only.
    The platina seems to exist in varied proportions in the
silver ores     of Guadalcanal ; some specimens furnished me
in the proportion         of 10 of platina in tlic loo of silver, while
others yielded almost imperceptible traces only: this shows
that this metal does not form an essential or truly consti
tuent part of these ores, and that it is only mixed with them
in unequal quantities in various parts of the vein. The silver
seems   to be in the same case;            it varies  much   in its pro
portions also: I have found it in the gray silver mines of
Guadalcanal from 2 up to 7 hundredth parts of the total
weight.
    The  process      I   used,  after several   comparative trials, in
order to extract the platina fiom these ores, consists in the
following operations : — I , Alter having reduced the mineral
into fine powder I roasted it by a gentle heat, stirring it con-
timmlly.      2. I mcked I he matter with an equal quantity of
common potash, by which means I obtained a metallic but
ton composed of platina, silver, lead, copper, and sometimes
a  link  antimony       ;  iron and apart of the lead      remained in
the sQorise.      3.   I afterward'    separated the copper, lead, and
antimony,     vby   cupellation   ;  nothing except silver and platina
then remained.           4. I freed this last metal from the silver by
                                                                  mean*

                     in the Silver Mines       of Guadalcanal.                      337
means   of aquafortis, or the nitric acid of commerce, which
dissolved the silver and left the platina: I washed the latter
and melted it again, in order to give it a metallic lustre.
5. As the lead which      exists naturally in the first metallic
button is not in a sufficient quantity for taking up all the
copper in the cupellation, I submitted this, metal a second
time to the same operation with a new quantity of lead.
6.    As. on             the quantity of silver is too small
                the contrary,
to permit      aquafortis to attack the alloy, I added, as
                    the
when gold is to be separated, a new portion of this^metal.
7. I ought to say, that if we employ aquafortis a little con
centrated, it dissolves             time with the silver a por
                                  at the same
tion of platina, which may be easily perceived by the brown
colour assumed by the solution.
   If platina exists in the gray ore of Guadalcanal in a pro
portion which admits of its being turned to advantage, it                                 -
cannot be doubted, after the above                     experiments,         that    we
must dissolve it by means of aquafortis,                        as practised   when
we extract gold from silver ores ; and even                     if   we should have
no occasion to do this with respect to the platina, we must
always do it in order to procure the silver out of it; for,
whatever process is employed, these two metals are united,
on account of the similitude             of their properties.
      Platina seems to exist in the metallic state in these ores                      ;
for the simple acids do not dissolve the smallest quantity                           of
it, and     always found among the silex and sulphur
               it
               is
                                                                               whe^n
the former  forms part of the matrix        was even on exa
                                                       ;   it
mining these residues of ores, treated successively        the                 by
nitric and muriatic acids, that first perceived the platina.
                                            I
     What   remarkable here is, that none of the four metals
               is
newly discovered, and which attend the plat ina of the ores
of Peru, are to be found in those of Spain. This considera
tion   of great importance, since
          is                         will have great deal of
                                                 it                  a
influence upon the methods of extracting this metal, and since
it gives hopes of obtaining     in   state of purity, which we
                                       it       a
cannot obtain      the platina of Peru, except with great ex
                          in
pense and after many difficult experiments.
     If
      these hopes are realised, as every thing inclines us to
think they will be,            we shall have    a   precious metal in Europe,

    PFAFF, of Kiel,       to   M. BERTHOLLET*.
J\T     the very moment         I was occupied with inquiring how
the muriatic      acid was     proditced which I obtained in some
operations, without         knowing from what cause, I was in
formed of the labours of         M. Pacchiani.
    I therefore entered upon an extensive series of experiments,
in order to examine how far his discovery was- well founded.
 I took every possible precaution in my experiments, the cir
cumstances of which          1 varied   as   much    as   possible.    I sub
mitted repeatedly distilled water in glass tubes of different-
diameters to the influence of the poles of the Galvanic pile,
by establishing the communication between the water and
these tubes, sometimes by syphons filled with water, some
times by fibres of flesh, nerves, and linen threads, Sec. I
employed piles of from 6O to 300 pairs of metallic disks in
order to vary the degree        of electrical force,       the difference   of
which     Changes .chemical combinations so remarkably.
    I obtained traces of acid in the water exposed to the po
sitive pole ; but this acid was by no means muriatic acid :
it  was always nitric acid (the formation of which by the Gal
vanic pile I announced five years ago) resulting from the
combination of the oxygen disengaged from the water with
the azote more or less contained in the water; the more I
freed    the    water, by a long continued ebullition, of all the
air it contains, and excluded the free access of the atmo
spheric air, the more also were the traces of the nitric
                   * From Anualjs de Chtmic,  tom. li. p. 314.
                                                                         acid

acid diminished.            It   is therefore   an     error in M. Pacchiani
to say that this self- named discovery of his, of the formation
of muriatic acid, is occasioned by thedeoxidation of the water.
   The German chemists, and among other* Messrs. Ehrann
and Simon, assert,   that, by employing very pure rlistilltf!
water, no trace of muriatic acid is discovered ; but that
it shows itself the instant any annual substance whatever is
employed.         This     is not true; because,        if   we free this animal
substance  from the muriate of soda and ammonia it contains)
by repeated ebullitions in water, no muriatic acid is obtained.
In the water exposed to the influence of the negative pole,
there is always formed a little         ammonia by the combination
of  the hydrogen           liberated from the water with the azote it
also contains.
     I   pledge   myself for the correctness of these results                        ;   I
have taken every possible precaution in obtaining them                           :   we
may be the less deceived as to the non formation of muriatic
acid, by reflecting that l-5000dth part of a grain of this
acid may be detected by a slight white shade in any concen
trated solution of nitrate of silver.  I shall have sonn the
honour to transmit you the detail of all my experiments ou
this subject.

  use  of simple     vegetable paper for the intermediate disks, and
  I frequently moistened with distilled water the cloth used
  for corking the tubes ; I was certain", by this means, that the
  substance which served as a conductor to the metal disks
  had no influence whatever upon the decomposition of the
  water, nor upon the formation of the muriatic acid and the
 alkali. In consequence of this, I did not think that I should
 deprive myself of the advantage 1 might obtain by moisten
 ing the disks with some saline solution, an abundant source
 of electrical fluid, and which for this reason wonderfully in
 creases the activity        of  the pile.
     On the    Ilth of         November,      about two o'clock,         T  con
 structed a pile of 900 disks           of zinc, copper,   and paper       :   the
 paper ones had been previously soaked               in a solution      of mu
 riate  of soda.       I  placed two wires       of pure gold    at    the two
 poles of zinc      and copper;        each  of them communicated           with
 a particular tube filled with distilled           water, closed up at the
 lower end by       a piece     of cloth   several times washed       in water
 equally well distilled : these tubes were plunged into a glass
 of  the same water, and were closed in the upper part with
 Spanish wax      :   I  had Adapted      to them a small crooked glass
 pipe,   by means        of which     each or them communicated              with
 a small bell glass, full of water, at the temperature of 15
 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer.                  The atmosphere being
 very damp, the pile had done very little at the end of 48
 hours.     From the 13th to the 14ih the air became drier;                      a
quantity of air bubbles, which                were disengaged   around the
 gold wires, particularly towards the negative pole, indicated
that the pile acted with much force.                On the 14th, at seven
o'clock in the morning,             I looked    at the two tubes    :   that    of
the positive pole presented             a slight c:tron colour, and half
the bell glass was filled with gas; towards the other pole
there was no alteration.               At eight o'clock a red powder,
inclining    a  little to the violet, was suddenly precipitated,
and in great abundance, in the tube of the positive pole.
On the 15th, at one o'clock p. m., I analysed the gas which
was liberated     from this tube in the presence of several mem-
oers   of the society:        it was oxygen gas, with which I filled
a  bell glass that contained six scruples and a half of water;
                                                                              the

                    upon the Decomposition           of Water.                   341
the tube which corresponded with                  the gold wire,          and con
tained seven samples of pure water, remained half full of a
liquor vith which I dyed turnsole paper of a red colour, and
this paper resumed its colour by means of an alkaline solu
tion   :  some drops       of  a  solution of nitrate of silver, poured
upon this liquor, gave in a moment a precipitate insoluble
in the mtric acid ; the piece of cloth which corked the lower
end    of  the tube in question, appeared,              in  a   great measure,     of
a  violet red.       I   cut this coloured         part    into two pieces; I
applied nitro-muriatic           acid to the one, and oxy-muriatic              acid
to the other      :  a  few minutes afterwards the colour disappear
ed, and the cloth resumed its whiteness.                   A solution of nitro-
muriate of tin restored to these liquors, which had been thus
discoloured, the violet colour.                The gold wire of the same
pole was worn away              a good    deal at every part        of it.  and re
sembled      a needle      at its extremity.         An analysis of         the gas
liberated from the negative tube yielded pure hydrogen gas;
it filled two bell-glasr-es and a halt', each of which might
perhaps contain about six scruples and a half of water. The
tube of this pole. which had at the beginning of the opera
tion about seven scruples of water, remained half full of a
liquor, which reddened the tincture of turmeric, to which
the acids again restored its yellow             colour:     the nitrate    of silver
applied to this liquor furnished an ash-coloured precipitate,
perfectly soluble in the nitric acid*.
    In order to dissipate the least idea that the muriatic salt,
with which I moistened the disks in the experiment of the
 1 1th of November, had the smallest                influence upon the pro
duction of the muriatic acid at the positive pole, I recom
menced the same              experiment on the 16th, by employing
other disks of paper soaked in a solution of sulphate of alu-
mine, and by carefully wiping the Dietal ones : in a few days
I  obtained the same results           f-
   * The nitrate of silver, oxalate of ammonia, muriate of barytes, did not at
all trouble the water which was used in these experiments.
   f This sulphate of alnmine certainly does not contain muriatic salts: wish-
ing to ascertain thin, I dissolved six scruples of it in distilled water, and I preci
pitated it by the nitrate ol barytes. 1 filtered this liquid; and, having treated it
 with nitrate of silver, no precipitate at all appears.
                                        Y4                                       We

   We may therefore infer            the   following consequences         and
results from what I have now detailed           :
   In the first place, seven scruples "of water submitted to
Volta's pile, as I have indicated, after having furnished to
the positive pole a quantity of oxygen equal to the volume
of three scruples and a quarter of water, passed to the state
of ox V- muriatic acid, which dissolved part of the cold wire,
by thus forming a fluid of a citron colour ; and, after having
furnished a quantity of oxygen equal to the first volume, the
oxy-muriatic acid becomes simple muriatic acid ; and the
gold, which in this manner hud lost its menstruum, is pre
cipitated in the state of oxide.
  Secondly, the violet precipitate was a perfect oxide of
gold, since it was dissolved in the oxy-muriatic acid, and as
I obtained from it the purple of Cassius by                 means    of   the
nitro-muriate of tin.
   Thirdly, while at              pole the muriatic acid is
                             the positive
formed by the disengagement of a certain quantity of oxy
gen, a true alkali is produced at the negative pole by the
disengagement of double the quantity of hydrogen.     This
result agrees with that of M. Mascagni ; but it differs from
that of M. Pacchiani, in which the real existence of the
hyper-oxygenated        water he has announced remains yet to
be proved.
   In   the whole course       of                and others of
                                    these experiments,
the same kind, I was convinced that in order to render the pile
active a very dry^atmosphere  is necessary, and a very high
temperature, and, although several persons think otherwise,
that the pile should not be isolated. To conclude: not only
is it unnecessary      that the water with which the intermediate
paper disks are moistened should be distilled, but it is even
very advantageous  to 'dissolve some saline substance in                   it,
which might speedily oxidate the zinc, the metal of the po
sitive pole: the reason for this is, lhat the activity of the
pile increases   proportion lo the oxidation of this metal,
                 in
and even that the muriatic salts do not             in   this case directly
influence the production of the muriatic                 acid, but simply
oxidate this metal  which several other salts do, more or
                        ;
less.   I   observed   besides,     that after having obtained acid as
                                                                  well

 well  as  alkali,   when the disks being dried the pile ceases to
 disengage     the  electrical fluid, the affinity of the acid of the
 positive pole with the atkali of thj negative pole enters into
 action,   a muriatic salt is formed.
    The radical of       the muriatic acid is therefore a fact as cer
 tain  as  it is novel in chemistry,         and  for which we are in
 debted to M. Pacchiani ; as well           as  for many others which
 have   presented      themselves almost spontaneously to others,
 but which no person except M. Pacchiani knew how to lay
 hold of.       Keir and Cavendish seem to have been in this
 predicament, since they mention a little muriatic acid in the
 water produced by the comb»?tiou of hydrogen with oxy
 gen, without having ascertained the true origin of it.               On
 this subject we may consult the Essay on Static Chemistry,

 .TJ.AVING,      a short time since, amuscJ myself with attempts
 to sketch       various interesting views without an adequate
 knowledge of the art of drawing, my mind was naturally
 employed in facilitating the means of transferring to paper
 the apparent relative positions of the objects before me; and
 1 am   in   hopes    that the instrument        which I contrived for
 this purpose may be acceptable even to those who have at
 tained to greater proficiency in the art, on account of the
 many advantages it possesses over the common camera
'obscura.
    The principles on which it            is constructed  will probably
 be most distinctly       explained by tracing the successive steps
 by which     I  proceeded     in its formation.
    While    I  look    directly down at a sheet of paper on my
 table,   if I   hold between my eye and the paper a piece of
 plain glass inclined from me downwards as an angle of 45°,

     To obtain          a   direct view,          it   is   necessary        to have two reflec

cannot both be seen distinctly in the same state of the eye,
on account of the difference of their distances, and the ef
forts of successive adaptation of the eye to one or to the other
would become painful                     if
                             frequently repeated.    In order to
remedy this inconvenience, the paper and pencil may be
viewed through   convtx lens of such

       In   some cases,          a    different construction                   will     he preferable.
Those eyes, which without assistance are adapted to seeing
near objects alone, will not admit the use of convex glass,
                                                                                 is a

may be wanted to suit an eye that is long- or short-sighted.
Those persons, however, whose sight is nearly perfect, may
at pleasure use either of the glasses.
  The instrument          represented in that figure differs moreover
in other       respects   from the foregoing, which ! have chosen
to describe first, because             the action      of     the   reflectors     there
employed would be more generally understood.      But those
who are conversant with the science of optics will perceive
the advantage that maybe derived in this instance from pris
matic reflection ; for, when a ray of light has entered a solid
piece of glass, and falls from within upon any surface at an
inclination of only 22 or 23 degrees, as above supposed, the
refractive power of the glass is such as to suffer none of that
light to pass out, and the surface becomes in this case the
most brilliant reflector that can be employed.
   Fig. 2. represents the section of a solid prismatic piece of
glass, within which both the reflections requisite are effected
at the surfaces ab,bc, in such a manner that the ray fg,
after being reflected first at g and afterwards at A, arrives at
the eye in a direction he, at right angles to fg.
   There is another circumstance in this construction neces
sary to be attended to, and which remains to be explained.
Where the reflection was produced by a piece of plain glass,
it is obvious that any objects behind the glass    sufficiently       (if
illuminated) might be seen through the glass as well as the
reflected image.  But when the prismatic reflector     em                         is
ployed, since no light can be transmitted directly through
it,   the eye must be so placed             that only         a   pail of its pupil
may be intercepted          by    the edge      of   the prism,      as at   e,   fig. 2.
The distant objects will               then be seen         by   this portion     of the
eye,  while the paper and pencil are seen past the edge of the
prism     the remainder of the pupil. -
          by
      In order     to avoid inconvenience that might arise from un
intentional motion of the eye, the relative quantities of light
to be received from the object and from the paper are regu
lated     by   a   small hole in   a    piece   of   brass,which,           by   moving
on   centre at c, fig. 3,
      a                             is   capable      of adjustment          to every
inequality of light that          is   likely to occur.

  §46            Description   of the Camera Lucida.
  Hear the eye, does not require to be large,        I have ofi many
  Accounts preferred the smallest size that could be executed
  with correctness, and have had it constructed on such a
  scale  that   the lenses   are only   three.fourths of' an inch in
  diameter.              i
     Although     the original design and principal use of this in
  strument are to facilitate the delineation of objects in true
  perspective,    yet this is by no means the sole purpose to
  which it   is adapted; for the same arrangement of reflectors
 tnay be employed with equal advantage for copying what
  has been already drawn, and may thus assist a learner in
 acquiring at least a correct outline of any subject.
     For this purpose, the drawing to be copied should be
 placed, as nearly as may be, at the same distance before the
 instrument that the paper is beneath it ; for in that case the
 size will be the same, and no lens will be necessary, either
 td the object or to the pencil.
     By a proper use of the same instrument every purpose of
 the pentagraph may also be answered, as a painting may be
 reduced    in any proportion required     by placing it at a distance
 in due proportion       greater   than that of the paper from the
 instrument.       In this  case a lerts becomes requisite for ena
 bling  the eye to see at   two unequal distances with equal di
 stinctness   ;  and, in order that one lens may suit for all these
 purposes, there is an advantage in varying the height of the
 stand according to the proportion in which the reduction is
 to be effected.
    The principles on which the height of the stem               is ad
justed will be readily understood by those who are              accus
 tomed to optical considerations.          For, as, in taking   a per
 spective   view, the rays from the piper arc rendered parallel
by placing a lens at the distance of its principal focus from
 the paper, because the' rays from the distant objects are pa*
talli'l;  so also,   when the object seen by refltction is at so
 short a distance that the rays received from it are in a sensi
 ble degree divergent, the rays from the paper should be
made to have       the  same   degree  of divergency, in order     that
the paper may be seen distinctly by the same eye ; and for
this purpose the lens must be placed at a distance less than
                                                                     its

               Description   of the Camera Lucida.                347
its principal   focus.    The stem of the instrument           (which
slides) is accordingly    marked   at  certain distances, to whjct}
the conjugate foci are in the several proportions of two,
three, fbur, &c. to one; so that distinct vision may he .ob--
tained in all cases by placing        the   painting   proportionally
more distant.
    By transposing the convex lens to the front of the instrur
ment, and reversing the proportional distances, the artist
might also enlarge his smaller sketches in any proportion
 with   every desirable degree    of correctness     ; and  the uatu-r
 ralist, by employing a deeper lens, might delineate minutje
objects in any degree magnified.
    Since the primary intention of the camera lucida is air
 ready, in some measure, answered by the camera obscura, 4
 comparison will naturally be made between them.              The Q\)-
jections to the camera obscura are,
    1st,  That it is too large to be carried about with        conver
nience ; but the camera lucida         is  as small and portable as
can be wished.
    2d, In the former, all objects that are not situated         near
 the centre of view are more or less distorted.
                                                                       •
    In this there is no distortion ; so that every line, eveij the
 most remote from the centre of view, is as straight as those
 that pass through the centre.
    Sdly, In that the field of view does not extend niore than
 30, or at most 35 degrees, with distinctness.
    But in the camera lucida        as    much as 70 or    SO degrees
 might be included in one view.

sale by patent, those who are desirous of purchasing the in
 strument are informed that Mr. Newman, No. 24, Soho-
 square, has at present the disposal of it.

    MICHAEL HAUSSMANN *.
 WATER                only menstruum proper for extracting
               is not the
 the colouringmatter of plants, in order to make it adhere to
 the alumine and the oxide of iron fixed on any particular
 cloth.    There are vegetables, such as the bugloss (Anchusa
 tinctoriu), which only give up their colouring particles to
 alcohol.    I shall not hazard a definition of the nature of
 the colouringsubstance of the bugloss ; it is so susceptible
of being decomposed by the continued action of heat, even
belosv that of boiling water, that, after having extracted it
by alcohol, it cannot be thickened or concentrated by eva
poration, without being destroyed ; so that it is impossible
to make any further use of the spirituous part of the tincture
of bugloss : I ascertained this by reducing a certain quantity
of it to one-fourth by distillation.   The alcohol I obtained
from it appeared pure, and the residue was dirty, and im
proper for dyeing. I was to blame in not better examining
it, in order   to see   if it
                        contained any thing oily or resinous ;
my researches at that time had no other object than to pro
cure the colouring parts of the bugloss, and I had reason to
be satisfied   with it.
   By mixing     asufficient quantity of the spirituous tincture
of bugloss with six or eight   parts of pure water in a copper
kettle, and by afterwards dyeing with it my skains of cotton
which were prepared for the red tincture of Adrianople, ac
cording to my own process, and as adopted by M. Chaptal,
1 obtained at the end of an hour, and by directing     the fire
gradually until it produced a boiling heat, a beautiful colour
of purple violet. In order constantly              to produce this colour
of the liveliest hue, it is only necessary          that the cotton should
not be spoiled by the preliminary preparations, and for this
reason the practice of galling should not be made use of;
the linseed oil I made use        of for this preparation                  was boiled
with white lead, taking         care not to burn           it,        as   that   would
have soiled the cotton.

  The     great brilliancy         which this purple violet colour pro
duces upon cotton,            and    which     surpasses   that   of   the finest
satin dyed in the ordinary manner, suggested to me tlie idea
of producing it on the fine calicoes. The success so com
pletely answered my wishes, that we soon manufactured some
whole pieces of Turkish shawls, dyed of this colour, for
Messrs. Soehne and Co. of Paris, who received them some
years ago    but although they were greatly admired, they
                ;
were too high priced for the present time?. Formerly, when
it was the fashion for the ladies to wear calicoes at all sea-
sorJs, we were under the necessity of making a high priced
article of that description if we wished to succeed in busi
ness : I had proofs of this 32 year* ago, when I lived at
Rouen     for, having then some pieces of ten ells length for
          ;
making robes, a very rich fabric, Isold them for 22 loui*
d'ors apiece.   These pieces came from the manufactory of
the famous Jean Henry Schule, at Augsburg, whom I think
the first manufacturer in Europe who has, united the grcatett
possible perfection and beauty in the printing of calicoes :
his productions             made    so great    a noise    in the mercantile
world,        that   even    the    emperor of China         requested    to   «ee
them, and greatly admired them when compared with those
of his own country.
  The cotton stuff= destined for printing a ground of purple
violet,       and which is to preserve some white objects,require
to be well bleached, in    order that they may be dirtied at
little as possible by the dyeing; for, although the purple
violet colour is so solid that it bears very well, without being
much weakened, the action of the alkaline ley of oxymu-
riate of potash, the white is re-established but with dimculcy.
   The alumine, fixed upon the stuff and saturated with the
colouring parts of the tincture of bugloss, still admits of the
application of the colouring parts of other animal and vege
table substances ; which givts room for an infinity of other
shades,  which may be augmented in an indeterminate man
ner, by diluting or weakening the Acetate of alumine intended
for printing, and by dyeing the purple violets and the shades
which belong to              it,
                       such as the violet, lilac, &c. &c.,                       by

&c.       By mixing all           these drugs in different proportions                      we
shall considerably multiply the shades, the number of which
may be also varied in a prodigious manner, by mixing more
or less acetate of iron with the concentrated or weakened
acetate of aluinine.
   The oxide of iron, printed upon cloth, or coming from a
concentrated acetic solution of iron, is coloured of a greenish
black by the tincture of bugloss ; and by weakening the
acetic solution of iron in different proportions we shall ob
tain a great variety of grayish shades, more or less deep and
iiiqrc or less greenish             ;    these         shades      are equally susceptible
of   changes    by the dyeing drugs already mentioned.
     If, on    purple violet grounds, or the shades derived
               the
from this colour, we propose to produce other dyeing colours,
without sensibly altering these grounds, before printing other
mordants it will be necessary to pass the stuffs dyed in bu
gloss tincture through weak sulphuric acid, in order to take
off the alumine from them which the colouring parts of the
bugloss tincture could not touch ; the purple, and the shades
derived from          it,    will       redden      a    little,    without     being much
weakened, however,                      by   the action       of   the acid.
     Linen,    prepared       in the same manner with cotton, presents
nearly the same  colours and shades on dyeing them with
bugloss tincture, producing also the same variations by
means of the other colouring drugs and   the modification               by
of   the acetate      of    lead.       It   is   the same case         with silk properly
alumcd    ;    presents very brilliant colours and shades
              it                                                                             by
beinjr dyed \yith bugloss, which however will only dirty the
silk,     in place of aluming

                     of tin   :
of this metal for the colouring matter of the bugloss, which
produces no better effect upon linen and cotton treated with
solutions or salts of tin. The same inconvenience would
probably be felt with woollen, which    never treated with          1
bugloss tincture  but there
                       ;      no doubt that this stuff pre
                                                  is

LX.     Extract of a Letter from AT. GEHLEN, of Berlin,
     to M. VOOEL, containing some Remarks, 1st, Upon the
     Formic and Pyrotartarous Acids ; 2d, Upon CarbureMed
     Subphur ; 3d, Upon the Klebschiefer or MSnilite ofMenil-
     Montant*.
JL CANNOT adopt the opinion of Messrs. Fourcroy and Vaut
quelin, that the formic acid is analogous to the acetic acid.
When we distil in B. M. the expressed juice of ants, we
obtain     a whiteliquid, which cannot contain malic acid.
This distilled acid, combined with bases and afterwards dis
engaged by the sulphuric acid, or by any other method, does
not resemble the acetic acid.   Lowitz was not able to cry
stallize it under the most favourable conditions.                 To    a spe
cific gravityequal to that of the acetic acid, it requires a
much greater quantity of bases for its saturation ; it forms
with them salts which enjoy particular properties ; with
copper, for instance, a blue salt in cubes, which melts in
its water    of crystallization      ;   with alcohol it forms        an ether
quite different : lastly, it displaces the aoetic acid from all
its saline combinations.
   It is the same case with the pyro-tartarous acid, which
Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin also maintain to be acetic
acid.   The acid liquor obtained from the dry distillation of
cream of tartar, exposed to a slow evaporation, leaves abun
dance  of brownish crystals as a residue, which cannot be
acetic acid, neither are they tartarous acid, as my own ex
periments and those of M. Rose have proved.
   M. Lampadius proved, some years ago, that carburetted
sulphur, as he calls      it,
                      contained no carbon. He also proved
that the combination of hydrogenated sulphur     not what        is
ithas been hitherto thought.
     M. Klaproth  has made    new analysis of the klefi-
                                         a
schiefer of Menil-Montant (common resinite quartz, or me-
nilite).    The results     are different    from those he gave in his
                                                                          %

XT     is
       a fact upon which all chemists are agreed, that during
digestion of certain substances the acetic acid      formed                             is            :
the experiments   am now about to mention are therefore
                       I
conformable to the phenomena that have been formerly ob
served.  But       not equally well admitted that the spi
                    it   is
rituous fermentation can take place in the stomach   this                                    :        is
only an assertion of M. Perperes himself.    We are of opi
nion, however, that this subject      well worthy of his at  is
tention,        and we invite him to pursue his researches.

 mentation is necessary to digestion, and that this fermenta
 tion may be either of a spirituous, an acid, or a putrid na
 ture.      Some alimentary substances even produce all these
 three effects, as has been demonstrated by several observa
 tions.      But, in general, each particular kind of food under
 goes that kind of fermentation which is most analogous to
 its nature.                                        • ..
     As we      are   acquainted with only one kind of spirituous
 fermentation, and only one kind of the putrid, I shall not
 speak of these two fermentations.                    But it is not the same
 case with the        acid fermentation,        because it gives rise to se
 veral    acids of different natures, which it is important to
 know in order to fix the opinions of chemists on the subject.
 For this     reason   I determined to make the following experi
 ments upon myself:                                                          j. j
     1st,   Knowing      that roasted chestnuts could not be digested
 by my stomach without                great difficulty,     and  that they al
ways created          wind, followed,        some     moments afterwards,
 with     an   insupportable        sourness on the stptnach,           I took
eight      ounces of them,           which    I '.ate   without   bread,   after
having been for thirteen hours without tasting any thing,
and my stomach being perfectly empty.                         An hour and a
half afterwards I felt- a swelling in my stomach (the usual
symptom         with    me after      eating    kernel     substances)   :  this
announced         the   production of some gas, which I coatrjved
to collect       in  the   following manner: — I took a funnel with,
a   long lube, which I bent into a semicircle ; I placed the
small end of it in the pneumatic tub, on the shelf of which
there was a bell-glass          filled with water ; and I had the pre
caution      to fill   the tub with water, in order to cover the
whole      of  the   tube   of the funnel, so that none of the gas
might be       lost which I might emit.               Some minutes after
wards I felt the dilatation             in. my stomach increase, and !
then belched up into the            funnel the wind out of my stomach
by applying my nrouth to the funnel.                   I emitted, at different
times, a cubic inch of           a gas   which had all the characters         of
the carbonic acid, which nothing belied, and a little atmo
spheric air, which we always swallow with our alimeuts, as
being necessary         to digestion.

              Formation
     The swelling of my stomach having decreased in conse
quence of. the evacuation of the atmospheric air and car
bonic acid, and the acid fermentation having undergone all
the usual periods, according to the sourness I felt on my
stomach,             I
                     to follow out my experiments.
                         proceeded
  Sd, It was necessary to ascertain the nature of the acid
contained in my stomach ; and for this purpose I had only
one method, that   of vomiting, in order to determine, by
future experiments, its specific characters.
   I resolved to take twenty grains of ipecacuanha diluted in
three ounces of distilled water, at                a single draught: a quarter
of   an       hour afterwards           I   drank some warm water, to the
amount             of fourteen ounces, without vomiting; but three
ounces more made me throw up, at two vomitings, all          I had
taken.
     weighed the whole
     1                                  I   had evacuated, and had only two
'ounces less than what                  I   had eaten and drunk.   I do not
know          if    the stomach        had digested these           two ounces    of
liquid, or           if it    had been absorbed.
   A minute inspection of what I had thrown up resembled
feculum diluted in water ; which showed that fermentation
had decomposed the nutritive substance I had eaten, and
the more so as the smell was strongly acetous : this began
to confirm the idea, which 1 had for a long time conceived,
of the formation of vinegar in stomachs of                           bad digestion,
and it encouraged me the more strongly to pursue my ex
periments.
  3. I dipped in the evacuated                          matter     turnsole paper,
which         wag        immediately        reddened.      I then put     in some
infusion            of violets,       which       was   also reddened.        Being
certain,           from these trials        of the re-agents, of the existence
of an acid in the substance                  evacuated,     I   endeavoured   to de
termine its nature,                 and had recourse to the following plan:
  4.      I   took        a    glass retort, in which I put all I had vo
mited ;        I                                          it,
                                        which was furnished
                    adapted a globe receiver to
with tube of
         a                 with   second tube which entered
                              safety, and         a
under  bell-glass filled with water, placed upon the shelf
          a
of the pneumatic tub, in orrVr to receive the gases which
might be dissolved in the substances which formed the sub

           Formation   of the   Acetous     Add in   the Stomach.
ject of my experiments.             I luted the whole, and gradu
 ally increased the fire until the contents of the retort began
 to boil. I continued the boiling until the liquid in the re
 tort had acquired a thick consistence.             I took down the ap
 paratus,     and   I found    in   my    receiver  sixteen     ounces and a
 half of a very white liquid, the smell as well as the taste
 of which      was like   that   of distilled acetous acid, and pos
 sessed   all the properties of the acids. As a gaseous produc
 tion   I had only a very little carbonic acid, which was easily
 recognised from the rapidity with which the bubbles of it
 passed through the Water, as well as by their size.
     5. Although the smell and taste of the produce of the
 distillation had already furnished me with strong proofs of
 the existence of the acetous acid, there certainly must have
 been combinations.          In order to ascertain this positively, t
 took soda, obtained by means of alcohol,               and     saturated  the
 whole liquid until it was supersaturated.              I  tiltered and eva
 porated to the necessary consistence for obtaining crystals
 of acetate of soda : I carried into a cool place the porcelain
 capsule which contained the saline liquor, and next day, to
 my great satisfaction, observed, upon a simple inspection,
 that the fprm of the crystals (which was that of striated
 prisms,     resembling strongly the very small crystals of sul
 phate of soda) was in reality that which belongs to the ace
 tate of that name, which I tasted, and the taste of which
 was bitter, pungent, yielding         a   sharp taste at the beginning,
 which ended by being alkaline; and, in short, quite similar
 to the acetate of soda in every respect.
     6. Apprehensive that the above experiments were not
 conclusive enough, I was anxious to satisfy myself more
 precisely.      For thjs purpose I took half an ounce of the
 saline substance which          I had obtained,       and dissolved it in
  six ounces    of distilled water.        I  divided this sojution into
  two eqijal portions :     in  the one    I^raduaJly poured very pure
  sulphuric acid, less, however, than was necessary for the
  entire decomposition ; and in the other I poured my solu
  tions  of barytes.    The first portion, which          had been decom
  posed by the sulphuric       acid, as having more affinity for soda
         this alkali has for the acetous acid, was put into a
                                    Z   3                                 amajl

small     retort,    to   which     I   adapted   a   small receiver, and
distilled    in   a moderate heat.         The produce obtained in the
receiver      was acetous acid          perfectly pure, and having a
very fragrant smell        ; iu short, it had all the properties of
the above acid.            In the     second    portion   I poured a so
lution of barytes, until         the soda was set free    ; I then poured
into    the   bottle    containing the acetate of barytes and the
 soda in solution,       in order to make comparative experiments,
a   quantity of alcohol, which dissolves this last alkali, and
 allows the acetate of barytes to precipitate. I was instantly
 fully convinced that it was the acetous acid, and all my sus
 picions were realised.
     It results from the experiments          I have described, 1st, That
 the    dilatation    felt in the    stomach in cases of bad digestion
 is occasioned by the formation of the carbonic acid, pro
 ceeding from a commencement of decomposition, which the
 nutritive substances taken           as  aliment undergo, particularly
 when they are of the nature of kernels;
     2d, That the sourness, which injures the organs of di
 gestion,     and    which     is  sometimes      felt so far up as the
  oesophagus,     proceeds from       a  quantity of acetous acid, which
 is formed by the complete decomposition of the aliments ;
     3d, That eight ounces of roasted chestnuts produced two
  ounces, six drachms of acetous acid, after having fermented
  an hour and a half in the stomach ;
      4th, and lastly, That the best method of remedying the
  disagreeable     sensation, commonly called heart-burn, which
  persons of weak stomachs experience,              is to take, after their
  meals, ten grains of columbine root with twelve grains of

LXII.      On    employing the Poor in Parish Workhouses
              By the late BENJAMIN PKYCE, Esq.*
       SIR,
TBIK,
    HE Bath      and   West of England Society having thought
proper to offer a premium           "  for the best account, for pub
lication, of the most practicable and profitable manner of
employing the poor in parish workhouses," I beg leave to
submit to their consideration such thoughts as have occurred
to me; and which, however imperfect, are the result of
much laborious investigation on this subject.
   At a time when every necessary of lire is uncommonly
dear, the poor increasing, and the rates collected for their
maintenance bear so hard on the industrious                       part    of  the
community,        every reasonable and humane exertion should
be made to render their labour in some measure productive.
For this    purpose     various schemes        have      in different work
houses    been    adopted, most of which have ended in disap
pointment      and loss.      In order to ensure better success in
future, let us take a view of the persons to be employed, and
we shall find ihat the greatest part of them are widows, and
children    too young to be apprenticed, persons labouring
under some infirmity, and those who are rendered incapable
by old age.       The robust and healthy poor who are able to
maintain themselves, should be admitted into workhouses
with    great caution,     and    be considered as temporary guests
only, to     be removed as soon as they can find employment
elsewhere.      The employment           to be provided for the inha
bitants of these receptacles of poverty and imbecility should
be such as is suited to their strength and capacity : it should
be something easy to learn, and in which they could in
struct or assist each other.            The articles should not be in
much danger of being spoiled by the inattentive or unskil
ful ; and they should also, as far as circumstances will ad
mit, (for such poor at least as are not likely to remain in
the workhouse,) be something in \\ hich, after their discharge,
they can be employed with advantage to themselves in their

 own habitations, or for masters in the same parish or neigh
 bourhood.
    The conveniences and local situation of the place, and
 the manufactures, if any, or chief employment carried on in
its vicinity, will generally point out the most practicable and
 profitable manner of employing the workhouse poor.          If to
 the inability of the work-people we add the too frequent in
attention of managers, we shall find but little encourage
ment to introduce any new manufacture into a parish work
house.     Could any thing be thought of which is sufficiently
easy   and  profitable, it would soon be adopted by numbers,
who would be enabled to undersell the workhouse manu
facture   by their superior skill and energy.     Nor can it b»
reasonably expected that poor objects, who have not been
able to maintain themselves by that sort of labour which
they have been accustomed to, will make any considerable
proficiency in a new employment which requires much
ability or exertion.
   Wherever      a considerable manufactory is established, in
any parish    or  neighbourhood, and is such as to admit any
part of it being carried on in a parish workhouse, it will ge
nerally be found most eligible that the poor should be em
ployed in the same sort of business.         In such situations,
part of the workhouse poor are generally reduced manufac
turers,, who can earn most at the business they have been
accustomed to, and instruct      others who are not capable of
being more profitably employed.       The best-regulated work
houses I have seen near the cotton manufactories in Derby
shire and     Lancashire,   and the woollen    manufactories    in
Yorkshire and Wiltshire, hire out as many of their poor as
they can to work for the master manufacturers ; and em
ploy those in the house in some easy part of the same busi
ness, namely, in picking and beating cotton, spinning wool,
breaking and spinning worsted, carding and winding yarn, &c.
At   Leicester, where there is a large stocking-manufactory,
the poor women in the workhouses are chiefly employed in
spinning worsted, and the children in closing stocking-
seams.
   In  sea-port towns,    or where the carriage from a sea-port
                                                               is

         On employing the Poor in Pansk Workhouses.            359
is not expensive, perhaps there is no general employment so
proper for the workhouse poor, who are least capable, as
that   of picking oakum. This employment can be performed
by   the blind, the lame, and the infirm, by the superannuated,
and by children.       A few years ago, on visiting the work
house or spinhouse at Amsterdam, (which is under excel
lent management,) I found that spinning, weaving, and
picking oakum, were the principal employments carried on
there.     Picking oakum is a principal part of the employ
ment    of the poor in   the parish workhouses at   York.    I was
 informed    there that they give 8s. per hundred weight, or
 Is. per stone, for old ropes, and sell the oakum for 25. per
 stone ; and that a man can pick a stone a day. Suppose
 the average earnings amounted but to 8d. or i)rf. a day, per
 haps there is no business in which the infirm workhouse
 poor can be so beneficially employed.
    The difference in local situations should be particularly
 attended to. The cheapness and ease with which materials
 can be procured, and ready demand for the produce, or for
 that sort   of labour which can    be performed     by persons so
 situated, will generally determine the most profitable man
 ner in which the poor in workhouses can be employed.
 For example : Bath is the resort of a great deal of genteel
 company : many thousand pounds a year, it is said, are
 paid there for washing, most of which is performed at
 small houses inconvenient for the purpose.        At Glasgow,     I
 have seen a public washhouse, where, by the saving of fuel
 and superior convenienceSi the business can be performed at
 less than   half the  expense  which it  costs at private houses.
 Such    an appendage     may easily be added to   a  parish work
 house.     Under   a steady careful matron,   washing would at
 Bath prove a very beneficial and proper employment for the
  women, and would prepare the girls for making good ser
  vants.
     I am no advocate for workhouses        in country parishes,
  having frequently seen their mismanagement and ill effects.
  But in such situations, part of the workhouse poor may
  occasionally be of some use in dibbling, setting, weeding,
  band-hpeing, haymaking,       harvesting, stone-picking,   or re

  pairing the public roads. Wherever ground can be pro
  cured, it would be adviseable to annex to the workhouse a
  large garden, or sort of garden farm, for raising potatoes and
  other esculent       vegetables,     to be cultivated     by the poor.
  Part  of  the ground may be appropriated to the growth of
  hemp, to be manufactured in the workhouse.                  After hemp,
  turnips may be sown,          as an useful and ameliorating         crop.
 This practice generally prevails amongst the most indus
 trious poor in Shropshire.             About twenty perches of land
 thus cultivated will there find employment in spinning for a
 poor man's wife and children, — at times when other work
 is not tf» be procured, — who will by their industry furnish
 him and themselves with decent coarse linen, and pay the
 rent of his cottage.
     The most general employment which can (more or less)
 he introduced into all workhouses,            and is useful to the poor
 in all situations, is perhaps that of manufacturing such arti
 cles of wearing-apparel, bedding, sheeting, &c. as are ne-
 cessary and proper for their own use, and that of other poor
 people.      Picking, carding,        and   spinning wool ; winding
 yarn; breaking and spinning worsted ; knitting coarse stock
 ings ; spinning flax, hemp, and the refuse or coarse dress-
ings, called hurds or hogs ; are all proper employments for
such of the poor in parish workhouses as cannot be more
beneficially     employed in other matters, agreeable to the
 principles hereby submitted to the Society.              The linen may
be woven for sheeting, shirting, bedding, towels, stockings,
wrappers, &c. or part of it may be woven with woollen to
make linsey-woolsey            for different garments.           Weaving
coarse articles     is  not  difficult   to learn ; with  a  fly shuttle it
is perfectly easy.        Lobby cloths and girth webs are woven
by the blind at the Asylum in Liverpool.                    Young girls
should be taught the use of the needle, so as to enable them
to do common repairs, in which they should occasionally be
employed ; as also in the domestic business of the house,
in order     to  qualify    them for service,        as is practised in
the Shrewsbury house          of industry.       In  some    workhouses
I    have  seen the poor       employed       in spinning mop-yarn,
making     mops,       spinning    shoe-thread, and winding can
                                                                      dle

mattresses.

earnestly recommend that it should be adopted with great
caution,  and not to the exclusion of another principle we
 should never lose sight of, which                     is, to employ every man, as
far as circumstances will admit,                         in that sort    ofbusiness
which        is   most habitual to him.

some of the most able and attentive magistrates of                                     that
county   intended to have established

cloth there         ;   but on the most mature consideration,                     it   was
judged expedient to carry on various employments, and that
 the several persons should be employed as nearly as may be
 in using the tools to which they had been accustomed. A
    shoe-maker          can best use his awl, and
                                                tailor his needle.

 At      the large house of industry at Liverpool, the same idea
is     adopted and carried into practice in its full extent.  The

the poor themselves, that as .many          conveniently     of them   as
can should work out for kind and humane masters.
    At Sheffield, Nottingham,                   and some other places,          I   learnt
that their workhouse poor are employed in the most healthy
and profitable manner, when hired out to work at any busi
ness they are capable                  of performing.          And   at the   Edinburgh
workhouse,  where the chief employment is spinning and
 knitting, found I that the same practice of hiring out is
judged most beneficial, and generally adopted.
    It   is much to be wished that the managers                        of every parish
workhouse    would properly discriminate and encourage the
poor  in proportion to their respective merits. In most well-
regulated workhouses they are allowed about 2d. in a shil
ling of their own earnings ; and in some places they have a
further     allowance            of    all they earn beyond what is reckoned
a reasonable             task.     I    would recommend that the master                of
every workhouse                  should      also have such an interest in the
poors' earnings, as -would stimulate him to provide the moat
beneficial business that the several individuals are capable of
performing ; but should not have power to correct, nor force
them to work beyond stated hours.         It is of great conse
quence that the poor should be properly employed.  If it be
known that they   will not be permitted to remain in sloth
and idleness, it would rouse many to industry, and prevent
them from seeking parochial relief.   A committee of re
spectable and intelligent persons should be selected to su
perintend the management of the workhouse, and some of
them from time to time to visit                        it,
                                   and pay strict attention
to what   going on there. To this committee the master of

ployment and earnings of every poor person under his care.
I  have myself assisted  carrying such plan into execution

nessed its good effects.
I        have now taken            a   view   of   the poor inhabitants        of parish
workhouses.   and have endeavoured to establish some prin

bounty from the society as an encouragement to useful
communications,         the reader will discover many remarks
which can have no claim to originality. But in others there
are ideas worthy      of respectful attention. The recommenda
tion   of public washing-houses is not deemed proper either
for Bath or any other city           ; as, although it may be possible
to perform the work cheaper than in more detached places,
by employing fewer hands, such oeconomy goes to the les
sening instead of supplying labour.                And where the opera
tion is often to be paid for by the affluent, the present more
general practice seems to be the most favourable to the poor.

    The first inducement of               the stock breeder,       as  well as the
grazier,        ought      to be, — the one to      breed that animal whose
disposition is most inclined to feed ; the other to produce
the animal fat at an early age.                  By these means the supply
will be greater for the consumer. The smaller animal (ge
nerally) has a more natural disposition to fatten, and re
quires (proportionably to the larger animal) less food to
make it fat; consequently the greater quantity of meat for
consumption can be made per acre. In stall feeding, what
ever may be the food, the smaller animal pays most for that
food.         In dry lands, the smaller animal           is always sufficiently
heavy for treading.                In wet lands less injurious. As to
milk, the smaller animal produces more goods for the food
she consumes than the greater animal.                      As to the yoke, it
is by ho means clear that oxen (taken generally) pay for
their work. In heavy and clayey soils they certainly do not.
And from experience in many sandy and dry soils (as in
Norfolk) they are not so profitable to the farmer as horses:
And where oxen               are  of service,  the middling-sized        animal  5s
to be preferred.
    As to        sheep,      I  beg this society to look to the premiums
given        for     South-Down         sheep ;   where     five   South-Down
sheep       to   three Wiltshire       have been kept on the same quan
tity of       acres,     and on the same ground,            and   have annually
consumed one-third                less hay.     This sufficiently proves the
smaller animal is better for the stock breeder ; and from my
own observations               of South-Down        and other different sorts
of   sheep,        I  have ever found the smaller sheep pay most for
their food.            I  am    therefore led to believe        the same argu
ment holds as good with the smaller sheep, as in the smaller
beasts.         If this society will look to the low, wet, and rich
soils of this kingdom, where large oxen have been usually
fed  ;   the graziers there (generally) are feeding Scotch,                  find
ing    iht.'   smaller most profitable.          And    if  we look to     Smith-
field,     we find the smaller animal              is always taken       in prefe
rence, by the greater number of butchers.                         I beg also to
mention pigs, (an              animal   by  uu  means    so  much     attended to
as it ought,) that invariably the smaller kind come soonest

    Among the different objects of improvements to which
the attention of this society has been long directed, non'6
has been more remarkable than that                of improving, on Sounft
and general principles,           the various kinds of live stock ; an
object confessedly of         great moment.          The ardour which the
society has evinced under this head, had been excited by the
prevalence of an opinion, which in many instances seemed
 to be gaining ground, that the largest races of animals were
the most profitable to the farmer, as paying most for the
food they ate.            And this opinion seems to have derived
 considerable countenance of late years from the frequent in
 stances   of premiums         and bounties given by the amateurs        in
London        for samples of large animals, produced 'Hi the
 Smithfield meeting.            Strong suspicions of the soundness of
 this doctrine having taken place in the minds of some practical
 men concerned ,m fatting etock, »dty -useftrb exptrinu-nts
 have been accordingly made.                  In many instances it had
 been    obvious that too many of the favourers of large ani
 mals, though professing to calculate on tlitj profit of the
 food consumed, had not in reality so done; but were de
 ceived by attending to the most striking feature of the bu
 siness, the nominal profit per head, instead of closely calcu
 lating the aggregate advantage per acre, which is certainly
 the true criterion.         This latter mode of 'calculation, requir
 ing   accurate    comparison of one rate against another; :seems
 to have involved too much care and extent of comparative
  account, to have been pursued in general practice, and to
  general   conviction.        Some gentlemen may be of opinion,
  (which indeed seems to have been the fact) that differences
  of profit in favour of large animals, especially horned cattfe,
  will be occasioned by local circumstances,; .as- of- very rich
  and   luxuriant     lands, or lands abounding           with very strong
                                                                     grass.

grass,    But admitting,   for argument's sake, though not
granting, that such may be the case in some few districts,
it is obvious that the doctrine could not apply generally,
because such lands are not generally found, but the contrary.
The fart of such advantage may, however, be doubted on
any land. And unless it could be proved that strong luxuriant
feed   cannot   be so closely eaten down and consumed by a
larger   number   of small or middle-sized animals, as by a
smaller number of large ones, the preference of the latter to
the former would remain doubtful in theory ; while practice
carefully conducted might prove the reverse.         That such
practice has so proved, wherever it has been fully and fairly
tried, is the point now contended for.        From such con
viction in  the minds  of competent men has arisen a zeal for
the further extension    of their knowledge, founded on ex
perience.    To such experience of facts they have been in
duced to add what has appeared to them the rationale of
the system they have adopted. Among such men the writer
of  the foregoing   summary observations conies forward for
the purpose of laying down axioms for general consideration,
and of course for general benefit. The respectability of his
name will not fail to add weight to his communication ; and
as such it is given to the public. — Editor of Bath Soc. Tr.

— Notes from Mr. Groombridge and the Astronomer Royal
were read, containing their observations on the planet
newly discovered by Dr. Gibers,      on the 26th and 27th of
April, as stated in our last.
   The reading of Mr. Home's curious paper on the stomachs
of animals was then resumed. Mr. H. took an extensive
view of the comparative anatomy, or peculiarity of structure,
of the stomachs, not only of ruminating animals, but also
of the crop and gizzard of birds. He traced the analogy
           8                                           between

                      Royal   Society   of London,                         367
between the muscular stomachs of birds, whose bills serve
to separate the husks from the seed, and those animals
whose fore- teeth assist in seizing their food            ; between      those
of carnivorous and of granivorous animals,                as   in the whale,
hippopotamus, beaver, watei-rat, ass, horse, dog, and man.
In the stomach of the horse, ass, and water-rat, much simi
larity appeared.       The kangaroo exhibited              a  peculiarity in
the great length       of its stomach, which             is covered with a
thin cuticle, and supported by numerous muscles to revert
the food, as it occasionally ruminates, according to the
observations of Sir J. Banks at New South Wales, although
those in the menagerie at Exeter-change have never been
perceived to perform any such process. The author con
cluded from his numerous observations on this organ in
various animals, and from the experiments of Spallanzani
and Hunter, that the stomach is the only seat of the di
gestive process ; that the gastric juice is secreted by glands
immediately attached to the oesophagus ; and that the py
lorus is chiefly a receptacle for the milky fluid. called chyle,
which passes ttofcnce to form blood. Mr. Home then made
a summary recapitulation of the particular structure of the
various stomachs which he had examined, and divided them
into six   classes.      1st, Stomachs      of ruminating           animals;
2d, of non-ruminating animals  ;     of animals ruminating
                                           3d,
occasionally; 4th, of carnivorous animals ; 5<h, of grani
vorous, and 6th, of herbivorons animals.    In the conclu
sion Mr. Home expressed his opinion that all animals may
ruminate   ;   and after referring to the observations             of    several
writers on this subject, related a case in his own practice of
a blind man who ruminates all his food.        This man has a
most voracious appetite, and his attendants are obliged to
 give him only a fixed quantity every day. He Usually eats
 one pound and a half of meat at once, which he swallows
 greedily ; and in .about ten minutes after he has finished his
 allowance,     regurgitates a mouthful, chews
               he                                    during        it,
 which time he seems more tranquil and happy, then swallows
 it,then brings up another, and chews and swallows        in              it
 like manner.       When     he has finished ruminating           all the food
 he has eaten,      he retires to sleep,   and enjoys his repose.

       May 7. The President in the chair. — A paper from Mr.
    Carlisle was read on spontaneous mortification in the human
    subject, similar to the case detailed by him last year.                 A
    female about 19 years of age was seized with a slight pain,
    accompanied with numbness and insensibility, in her foot,
   which gradually ascended to the groin, and in six weeks
   occasioned her death. When she died her body was opened,
   and the valves of the heart were found so imperfect, as not
   to be capable of conveying the blood to the aorta, whence
   it might circulate to the extremities. During the progress of
   the mortification,      the patient was occasionally in such a low
   state as to appear on the eve       of expiring.
      A   letter from a gentleman at Penzanee to Mr. Giddy
  was also read, detailing some singular appearances                 in the
  strata found in sinking a shaft for a tin mine in Cornwall.
  Pyrites, schist, and chlorite alternately occurred, at different
  depths ; but the most remarkable circumstance was that of
  a stratum      of  pebbles   found immediately contiguous to the
  tin,   and    at the immense depth of seventy-eight fathoms
  below the surface of the earth. The letter was accompanied
  with an accurate drawing, representing the relative position
 of    the   different strata, as they appeared on sinking to the
  vein   of  tin.
     May     14. — The attention     of the society was occupied with
 a letter to the President,        from   Mr. Knight, on some pecu
 liarities not hitherto observed in the domestic oeconomy of
 bees and wasps.          The principal     circumstances observed      by
 our author were the excursions and examinations performed
 by bees previous to their hiving; their investigations on the
bark and        hollow    parts  of old    trees ; their residence there
for   some days      ; and their direct route to and from their hives.
Hence       Mr. Knight inferred that          bees   have   a language  of
ideas.      He    observed   that bees form       political  connections  ;
that two hives will associate together in the same place for
ten or eleven days as friends, and afterwards quarrel and
separate.       This fact, however,     is equally as explicable on ihe-
supposition       of the ignorance and stupidity of these insects,
as on that      of their sagacity. It appears, according to Mr.
Knight's observations,           that neither      bees   nor waps     will,
                                                                   attack

 attack any person that comes between them and their man
sion, until some one has come from it to inform them of
their danger.    Bees collect the farina of plants, and trans
port it on their thighs to feed their young.          The wax he
considers, contrary to the opinion of Hunter,      as  a vegetable
 production, transported from the plant to the abdomen of
 the insect, and thence deposited in the combs.       As a proof
 that wax is of a vegetable nature, it is observed that the
 combs made after autumn are hard, dry and white,         whereas
 those made in summer are yellow and soft.
    In consequence of   the  Whitsun-holidays    the society ad
journed over one week, till Thursday May 28.
            SOCIETT OP ARTS,     ADELPHI,    LONDON.
    On Tuesday,     the 26th of May, this society held its an
 nual meeting at its house in the Adelphi, for the distribution
 of the premiums and bounties awarded within the year, —his
 grace the duke   of Norfolk in the chair.
    The meeting was splendid, and was numerously attended.
 Dr. Taylor, thesecretary, delivered the usual oration, in which
 he traced in a perspicuous manner the progress of this patri
 otic society from its feundation in 1754, through the lauda
 ble exertions of Mr. Shipley and others, until the present
 time, and went through a succinct review of the labours of
 the society, in the several departments of its business within
 the year past.
    The presenting of the medals and bounties to the different
 successful candidates then took place, and his grace delivered
 an elegant address to each   of the candidates upon receiving
 the prizes. When this business was over, Dr. Taylor con
 cluded the reading of his address to the company, by ac
 knowledging very valuable presents of scientific and useful
 books for the library of the society, of which the members
 have the use, to read at their own houses. He noticed the
 recent and additional   privileges  granted to ladies who are
 members of the Society of Arts, and, after recommending
 to the fair part of his audience to grace the list of the so
 ciety's members with their names, he mentioned, that 142
 new members have been elected within the year past, among
  whom were, the duke of Richmond, marquis of Stafford,

earls    of Bridgewater, Dundonald, and Percy ; lords Valentia

    The business closed soon after two o'clock, by a short but
neat address from the noble president, thanking         the compa
ny for their numerous and splendid attendance, with parti
cular acknowledgments to the Portuguese and American
 ambassadors, and other foreigners of distinction,              who
were present ; and to the fair part of his audience, whom
he hoped he should see again on the next anniversary, and
many more of them, in the capacity of members of a so
ciety so distinguished for its public spirit and usefulness.
  PATRIOTIC SOCIETY OF PHYSICIANS AND NATURALISTS
                     OF SUABIA, IN GERMANV.
    The    above   society has offered a prize of 100 florins for
the best treatise in answer to the     following questions : — Does
there exist any particular treatment for the accidental mala
dies whieh are called rheumatic ? How can such treatment
be characterized?         What are its connections with other ge-
neral'Jrealmems      ?   How   does it determine the development
oi' febrile maladies ? How arc we to distinguish the different
modifications of acute rheumatism, accompanied by swell
ings in the joints, from gout and arthritis? Upon what does
the character of these two last maladies rest? Are they iden
tical  ?  or rather, Can we point out their specific differences?
    The Society intimates that they do not wish the candi
dates to venture upon any hypothetical views : they rather
require    a methodical detail of facts, which may serve to de
velop the above-mentioned diseases.
    A prize of 100 florins is also offered for the best answer
to the following question : — In what diseases, and under
what circumstances, can we expect bleeding to produce good
effects, simply     of itself, or when conjoined with     the reme
dies  ?   What    are the doubtful cases   in which bleeding ought,
to be avoided?       The Society wish for an accurate detail of
facts in this case also, free from every thing like hypothesis;
and they have intimated that a simple recapitulation of some
technical rules, without connection with the general laws of
the animal organization,        will not answer their purpose.     *

                NEW METHOD OF CUIUNG TETANUS,
   The following new method of curing those dreadful con
vulsions, which carry off so many brave wounded soldiers, has
been practised in the hospitals of Germany with great suc
cess.    It  was first resorted to by the late       M. Stutz,    a phy
sician of eminence in Suaoia, and he was led to this impor
tant discovery from the analogy of a simple fact. M. Hum-
boldt had announced, in his work upon the nerves, that on
treating the nervous fibre alternately with opium and car
bonate of potash, he made it pass five or six times from the
highest decree of irritability to a state of perfect asthenia.
The method of M. Stutz, who has been employed with the
greatest    success   in the German        hospitals,  consisted in an
alternate internal       application of opium and carbonate of
potash.      It  has been seen that when 36 grains of opium,
administered       in the space of 24 hours, produce no effect,
the patient was considerably relieved by 10 grains more of
opium, employed after having given the alkaline solution,.
This new treatment of         tetanus   is worthy   of  the attention  of
medical men.

 with an uncommon opportunity of prosecuting their re
 searches in Comparative Anatomy.
    Surgeons in the Army and Navy may be assisted in re
 newing their Anatomical Knowledge, and every possible
 attention will be paid to their accommodation as well as

 with every convenience, will be open from Five o'clock in
 the morning, till Four in the afternoon, for the purposes of
Dissecting and Injecting, where Mr. Brookes attends to
 direct the Students, and demonstrate the various parts ai
they appear     on Dissection.    An extensive Museum, con

be less liable to overturn, and in consequence    of  the friction
being almost wholly done away, will move with much less
power or labour of the horses ; the necessary oil or grease
 being supplied without separating the wheel from the axle,
 are so securely attached as to obviate entirely the frequent
 accident of the coming off of the wheels in travelling ; and
 should they by any means be damaged or destroyed, any

I.   The Bakerian         Lecture,     on some       Chemical Agencies      of
    Electricity.          By     HUMPHRY         DAW,        Esq.    F, R. S,
    M.R.I. A.*
                               1. Introduction.
 J. HE chemical effects produced by electricity have been for
some time objects of philosophical attention ; but the no
velty of the phenomena, their want of analogy to known
facts, and the apparent discordance of some of the results,
have involved the inquiry           in much obscurity.
    An attempt        to elucidate the subject          will not, I  hope, be
considered by the society as unfitted to the design of the
Bakerian lecture.           I shall have to detail some minute, and
I fear tedious, experiments ; but they were absolutely essen
tial to the investigation.           I shall likewise, however, be able
to offer some illustrations of appearances which hitherto have
not been fully explained, and to point out some new pro
perties of one of the most powerful and general of material
agents.
     II.  On the Changes produced by Electricity in Water.
    The   appearance       of acid and alkaline matter in water acted
on hy a current         of electricity at the opposite electrified me
tallic surfaces, was observed             in the first chemical        experi
ments made with the column               of Voltaf.
    Mr. Cruickshank          J supposed      that the acid was the nitrous
acid and the alkali ammonia.                   M.   Desormes§      soon after

    attempted              to show by experiments        that muriatic       acid and
    ammonia were                  the products;   and   M. Brugnatelli *      asserted
    the formation of   new and peculiar substance, which he
                                   a
    has thought .proper to call the electric acid. The experi
    ments said to be made in Italy, and in this country, on the
    production of muriate of soda are recent f, and the discus
    sions with regard to them still alive. As early as 1800, I
    had found, that when separate portions of distilled water,
    filling two glass tubes connected by moist bladders, or any
    moist animal or vegetable substances, were submitted to the
    electrical action of the pile of Volta by means of gold wires,
    a nitro-muriatic  solution of gold appeared in the tube con
    taining the positive wire, or the wire transmitting the elec
    tricity,and a solution of soda in the opposite tube J : but
    I soon ascertained that the muriatic acid owed its appear
    ance to the animal or vegetable                matters employed      ;   for when
    the same fibres of cotton were made use of in successive                       ex
    periments,               after every process in a weak solu
                            and   washed
    tion of nitric acid, the water in the apparatus containing
    them, though acted on for a great length of time with a
    very strong power, at last produced no effect upon solution
    of nitrate of silver.
       In cases when 1 had procured much soda, the glass at its
    point of  contact with   the wire seemed considerably cor
    roded ; and I was confirmed in my idea of referring the pro-
    ducfion of the alkali principally to this source, by finding
    that no fixed saline matter could be obtained by electrifying
    distilled water in a single agate cup from two points of pla-
    tina connected with the Voltaic battery. Similar conclu
    sions with regard to the appearance of the muriatic acid had
    been formed by the Galvanic Society of Paris by Dr. Wol-
—   laston,           who hit upon the happy expedient of connecting the
    tubes           together by well washed asbestus; and by Messrs,
    Biot       and        Thenard§.

     Mr. Sylvester, however, in                          a   paper     published              in   Mr.
Nicholson's journal for                  last       August,    states,         that though no
fixed alkali or muriatic              acid    single vessel is
                                                    appears    when       a
employed, yet that they are both formed when two vessels
are used. And to do away all objections with regard to vege
table substances or glass, he conducted his process in a ves
sel made         of   baked tobacco.pipe clay inserted                         in   a   crucible of
platina.  I have no doubt of the correctness of his results ;
but the conclusion appears objectionable. He conceives that
he obtained fixed alkali, because the fluid, after being heated
and evaporated,  left a matter that tinged turmeric brown,
which   would have happened had it been lime, a substance
that exists in considerable quantities in all pipe clay ; and
even allowing            the presence           of fixed alkali,          the materials em
ployed for the manufacture of tobacco.pipes are not at all
such as to exclude the combinations of this substance.
     I   resumed        the inquiry       ;     I   procured small cylindrical cups
of   agate,     of    the capacity       of about       I -4th of a cubic inch each.
They were             boiled for some               hours in distilled water, and a
piece     of
         very white and transparent amianthus that had been
treated in the same way, was made to connect them toge
ther; they were filled with distilled water, and exposed, by
means      of two platina wires, to a current of electricity from
150 pairs      of plates of copper and zinc four inches square,
made      active by means of solution of alum.    After 48 hours
the process-was           examined         :    paper tinged with litmus plunged
into      the tube        containing      or positive wire,
                                               the transmitting
was immediately strongly reddened.  Paper coloured by tur
meric introduced into the other tube had its colour much
deepened         ;    the acid matter           gave     a very      slight degree of tur-
bidness to solution of nitrate of silver.                               The fluid that af
fected      turmeric       retained        this property after being stronglv
boiled,         and    it appeared        more vivid as the quantity became
reduced by evaporation               ;    carbonate of ammonia was mixed
with      it,   and the whole dried and        strong heat:  exposed      to   a
a minute quantitv of white matter remained, .which, as far
as my examination could co, had the properties of carbonate
of   soda.       I     compared    with similar minute portions of the
                                  it
pure carbonates            of potash and soda.       was not so oVli-It

quescent     as the former of these bodies,       and  it formed  a salt
with nitric acid, which, like nitrate of          soda, soon attracted
moisture from      a   damp atmosphere, and became fluid.
    This result    was     unexpected, but it was far from convin
 cing me that the substances which 1 had obtained were gene
rated.      In a similar process, with glass tubes, carried on
 exactly under the same circumstances, and for the same
 time, I obtained a quantity of alkali which must have been
 more than twenty times greater, but no traces of muriatic
 acid.   There was much probability that the agate might con
 tain some minute          portion of saline matter, not easily de
 tected by chemical analysis, either in combination or intimate
 adhesion in its pores. To determine this, I repeated the ex
 periment a second, a third, and a fourth time.              In the se
 cond experiment turbidness was still produced by solution
 of nitrate of silver in the tube containing the acid, but it
 •was less distinct ; in the third process it was barely per
 ceptible; and in the fourth the two fluids remained perfectly
 clear after the mixture.         The quantity of alkaline matter di
 minished in every operation ; and in the last process, though
 the battery had been kept in great activity for three days,
 the fluid possessed in a very slight degree only the power of
 acting on paper tinged with turmeric ; but its alkaline pro
 perty was very sensible to litmus paper slightly reddened,
 which    is a much      more delicate test   ; and after evaporation
 and the process by        carbonate   of ammonia, a barely percepti
 ble quantity of fixed alkali was still left.         The acid matter
 in the other tube was abundant ; its taste was sour; it smelt
 like wa:er over which           large quantities of nitrous gas have
 been   long kept    ;  it did not affect  solution of muriate of ba-
 rytes ; and a drop       of it placed  upon a polished plate of silver
 left after evaporation a black stain, precisely similar to that
 produced by extremely diluted nitrous acid.
     After these results I could no longer doubt that some sa
 line matter existing in the agate tubes had been the source
 of the acid matter capable of precipitating nitrate of silver,
  and of much of the alkali.            Four additional repetitions of
 the process, however, convinced me that there was likewise
 some other cause for the presence of this last substance; for
                                                                       it

            On some Chemical Agencies          of Electricity.         7
it continued       to appear     to the last in quantities sufficiently
distinguishable,        and   apparently equal in every case.     I had
used every precaution : I had included the lubes in glass ves*
sels out of the reach of the circulating air ; all the acting
materials had been           repeatedly   washed with distilled water;
and no part of them             in contact with the fluid had been
touched by the fingers.
    The only substance which            I could now conceive capable
of furnishing         the  fixed alkali   was the water itself.    This
water appeared pure by the tests of nitrate of silver and mu
riate of barytes ; but potash and soda, as is well known,
rise in small quantities in rapid distillations ; and the New
River water, which I made use of, contains animal and ve
getable impurities, which it was easy to conceive might furnish
neutral salts capable of being carried over in vivid ebullition.
    To make the experiment in as refined a form as possible,
I  procured two hollow cones of pure gold containing about
 25 grains     of water each ; they were filled with distilled wa
ter, connected by         a moistened piece of amianthus which had
been    used    in   the   former experiments, and exposed to the
 action of a Voltaic battery of 100 pairs of plates of copper
 and zinc of six inches square, in which the fluid was a so
lution of alum and diluted sulphuric acid. In ten minutes
 the water in the negative tube had gained the power of giving
 a slight blue tint to litmus paper; and the water in the po
 sitive tube rendered it red.           The process was continued for
 14   hours  ;  the acid increased in quantity       during the whole
 time, and the water became at last very sour to the taste.
 The alkaline properties of the fluid in the other tube, on the
 contrary, remained stationary, and at the end of the time
 it did not act upon litmus or turmeric paper more than in
 the first trial : the effect was less vivid after it had been
 strongly heated for a minute; but evaporation and the usual
 process proved that some fixed alkali was present.                 The
 acid,   as far as its properties were examined, agretd with
 pure   nitrous    acid having an excess of nitrous gas.
     I repeated the experiment, and carried on the process for
 three days ; at the end of which time the water in the tube
                                    A   4                           was

was decomposed and evaporated                 one-half of its
                                                     to more than
original quantity ; the acid was strong, but the alkali in as
minute a portion as in the last experiment.     It acted, in
deed, rather more vividly on the tests, on account of the-
greater diminution of the fluid, but presented the same re
sults after being heated.
   It was now impossible to doubt that the water contained
some substance in very minute quantities, capable of causing
the appearance of fixed alkali, but which was soon exhaust
ed;       and the question that immediately presented                          itself was,
Is this     substance              saline matter carried over in distillation                  ?
or is it nitrogen gas which exists in minute portions in all
water that has been exposed to air, and which, if an element
of   the fixed alkali,              would unc'er the circumstance of the ex
periment have been soon exhausted, whilst its absorption
from the atmosphere would be impeded by the saturation of
the water with hydrogen ?
     I    was much more inclined to the former than to the latter
supposition.               I   evaporated       a quart   of   the distilled water that
I    had used,           very slowly,         at a heat     below 140° Fahrenheit,
in    a silver still ; a solid matter remained,                       equal to      7-l0ths
of   a    grain; this matter                 had a saline but metallic taste,             and
was deliquescent when exposed to air : I could not obtain
from it regular crystals ; it did not affect turmeric or litmus,
but      a part     of
                 after being heated red, in
                         it,                  silver crucible,       a
exhibited strong alkaline properties.    was not possible to   It
make    minute analysis
           a              of so small    quantity, but     ap  a                     it
peared         to me to be principally             a   mixture      of nitrate of soda
and nitrate of lead; and the metallic substance,                               it   is   most
likely,     was furnished               by   the condensing tube       of   the common
still.'
     The    existence          of saline matter        in      the distilled   water be-
Lna thus distinct,                 it was easy to. determine its operation in
the experiment.                I    filled the two gold cones with water in
the usual manner               ;    that negatively electrified, soon attained
the maximum of its effect upon turmeric paper.  then                           I          in
troduced into  very minute portion of the substance ob
                         it    a
tained         by   the process         of evaporation that         has been       just   de
                                                                                   scribed   :

              On some Chemical Agencies            of Electricity.         Q
scribed:       in   less than two minutes         its effects were evident ;
and in five minutes the tint             of  the paper was changed to a
bright brown.
    T now conceived that, by collecting the water obtained in
the second process of slow distillation, I should be able to
carry on the experiment without any appearance of fixed
alkali ; and the trial proved that I was not mistaken.
    Some       of this water        was introduced    into the gold tubes,
and the amianthus moistened by it.
    After two hours            the   water in the negative tube produced
no effect upon turmeric paper; it did produce an effect upon
litmus, which it required great minuteness of observation
to perceive;          but it wholly lost the power by being heated
strongly for two or three minutes, so there is every reason
for supposing that it was owing to a small quantity of am
monia.
    I  made      a similar       experiment with a portion of the same
water in the tubes of agate that had been so often used, and
I  had the pleasure           of finding  the results precisely the same.
    To    detail any more operations           of this kind will   be unne
cessary ; all the facts prove that the fixed alkali is not gene
rated, but evolved, either from the solid materials employed,
or from saline matter in the water.
    I have made many experiments in vessels composed of
 different substances, with the water procured by very slow
distillation ; and in almost every instance some fixed alkali
 appeared.
    In    tubes    of wax     the alkaline matter was a mixture      of soda
 and potash        ;   and   the   acid  matter  a   mixture   of sulphuric,
 muriatic,        and   nitric acids.
     In   a  tube    of resin     the alkaline matter seemed to be prin
 cipally potash.
    A     cube     of Carrara marble of about an inch, havine an
 aperture       in   its centre, was placed in a crucible of platina,
 which was filled as high ag the upper surface of the cul e
 with the purified water; the aperture was filled with the same
 fluid  :   the crucible was positively electrified by a strong         Vol
 taic power, and           a  negatively electrified wire introduced into
 the aperture.
                                                                        The

    10           On some Chemical Agencies         of Electricity,
        The water soon gained the property of affecting the tint
   of turmeric; and fixed alkali and lime were both obtained
   from it     : and this effect took place in repeated experiments ;
    the fixed alkali, however, diminished in quantity every time ;
   and after eleven processes, conducted from two to three
   hours each, disappeared          altogether.   The production of lime
   water was uniform.
        I  marie a solution     of 500 grains of this marble in nitric
   acid ; I decomposed the mixture by carbonate of ammonia,
   and     I collected and evaporated the fluid part, and decom
   posed the nitrate of ammonia by heat.                About 3-4ths of a
   grain of fixed saline matter remained, which               had soda for
   its base.
        It   was possible that the Carrara marble might have been
   recently exposed to sea water; [ therefore tried, in the same
   way, a piece of granular marble, which I had myself broken
   from a rock on one of the highest of the primitive moun
   tains of Donegal.          It afforded fixed alkali by the agency of
   negative electricity.
        A piece of argillaceous schist from Cornwall, treated in
   the same manner, gave the same result ; and serpentine from
   the Lizard, and grauwacke from North Wales, both af
   forded soda.        It  is probable   that there are few stones that
  do not contain some minute portions of saline matter, which
  in many cases may be mechanically diffused through their
   substance; and it is not difficult to conceive the possibility
  of this, when we consider that all our common rocks and
  strata      bear  evident marks      of having   been antiently covered
  by the sea.
       I was now able to determine distinctly that the soda pro
  cured in glass tubes came principally from the glass, as I
. had     always supposed.
       I  used the two cones       of gold with    the purified water and
  the amianthus        ;  the process   was conducted as usual.      After
  a   quarter of an hour, the negatively electrified tube did not
  change the colour of turmeric.             1 introduced into the top of
  it  a   bit of glass ; in a few minutes the fluid at the surface
  rendered the tint of the paper of a deep bright brown.
       I had never made any experiments in which acid matter
                                                                   having

            On some Chemical Agencies           of Electricity.               ti
having the properties of nitrous acid was not produced, and
the longer the operation the greater was the quantity that
appeared.
     Volatile alkali likewise        seemed to be always formed in
very     minute     portions, during the first few minutes, in the
purified water in the gold cones, but the limit to its quantity
was soon attained.
     It was natural to account for both these appearances                 from
the combination          of nascent oxygen and hydrogen respec
tively,    with the nitrogen       of the common air dissolved in the
water ; and       Dr. Priestley's experiments on the absorption of
gases by water (on this idea) would furnish an easy explana
tion of the causes of the constant production of the acid, and
the limited       production of the alkali : for hydrogen, during
its solution in water, seems to expel nitrogen; whilst nitro
gen and oxygen are capable of co-existing dissolved in that
 fluid *.
   1
     To render     the investigation     more complete,          I  introduced
 the two cones        of gold with purified water under the receiver
 of an air pump : the receiver was exhausted till it contained
 only l-64th of the original quantity of air; and then, by
 means     of  a' convenient apparatus, the tubes were connected
 with    an active      Voltaic pile of fifty pairs of plates of four
 inches square.          The process was carried on for IS hours,
 when the result         was  examined.      The water in the negative
 tube produced         no effect upon prepared litmus, but that in
 the positive tube gave it a barely perceptible tinge of red.
      An incomparably greater quantity of acid would have
 been formed in a similar time in the atmosphere, and the
  small portion of nitrogen gas remaining in contact with the
  water seemed adequate to the effect.
      I repeated the experiment under more conclusive circum
  stances.      I  arranged    the   apparatus   as  before    ;   I exhausted
  the receiver, and filled it witli hydrogen gas from a conve
  nient airholder ; I made a second exhaustion, and again in
  troduced hydrogen that had been carefully prepared. The
  process     was   conducted for 24 hours, and at the end               of this

      It seems evident then, that water, chemically pure, is de
  composed by electricity into gaseous matter alone, into ox
  ygen and hydrogen.
     The    cause    of its decomposition,         and    of the other decom
  positions which have been             mentioned, will be hereafter dis
  cussed.
  III.   OH   I Jie Agencies of Electricity in           the Decomposition     of
                              various Compounds.
     The experiments that             have  been     detailed on the produc
 tion   of alkali from glass,          and  on the decomposition of va
 rious saline compounds               contained in animal and vegetable
 substances, offered some curious objects of inquiry.
     It was evident that in all changes in which acid and alka
 line matter had been present, the acid matter collected in the
 water round the positively electrified metallic surface, and
 the alkaline matter round              the negatively electrified metallic
 surface    ; and this principle of action appeared immediately
related     to one   of   the   first   phenomena observed in the Vol
taic pile — the decomposition of the muriate of soda attached
to the pasteboard ; and to many faets which have been since
observed on the separation of the constituent parts of neu-
trosaline and metallic solutions, particularly those detailed
by Messrs. Hisinger and Berzelius*.
    The first experiments that I made                   immediately with re
spect     to this    subject were        on  the decomposition         of solid
bodies, insoluble, or difficultly soluble in water.                   From the
effects    of   the  electrical    agency   on             I
                                                 glass, expected that va
rious earthy compounds would undergo change under si
milar circumstances; and the results of the trials were de
cided and satisfactory.
    Two cups        made of compact sulphate of lime, containing
about    14   grain measures of water each, were connected to
gether by fibrous sulphate of lime, which was moistened by
pure water: the cups were filled with this fluid; pldtina
wires from the Voltaic battery of 100 pairs                    of plates  of sis

                                                                         inches

              On some Chemical Agencies         of Electricity.         13
inches were introduced into them, so that the circuit of
electricity was through the fibrous sulphate of lime. In five
minutes the water in the cup connected with the positive
wire became acid ; that in the opposite cup strongly tinged
turmeric.    After an hour the fluids were accurately exa
mined     ;   when it was        found that   a pure and saturated   solu
tion     of lime
               had been produced in the cup containing the
negative wire,  which was partially covered with a crust of
lime, and that the other cup was filled with a moderately
strong solution of sulphuric acid.
   I procured two cuhica! pieces of crystallized sulphate of
strontites of about an inch ; a hole was drilled in each ca
pable of containing about eight grains of water: the cubes
were plunged in pure water in a platina crucible, and the
level of the fluid preserved a few lines below the surface of
the cubes       ;     two platina wires were introduced into the holes,
which      were filled with       pure water.    The disengagement of
 gas, when the wires were connected with the battery of 100,
 proved that the sulphate of strontites was sufficiently porous
_to form a proper conducting chain.     The results were much
longer in being obtained in this experiment than in the last;
some time elapsed before a sensible effect could be perceived,
but the termination was similar.    In thirty hours the fluid
in   the cavity containing         the negative    wire had   gained    the
 property of precipitating solution of sulphate of potash, and
 the presence of sulphuric acid in the other cavity was evident
 from its effect upon solution of muriate of barytes.
     I   made  experiment upon fluate of lime tinder like cir
                    an.
 cumstances ; but the crystallized fluate, not being equally
 permeable to moisture, the two cavities were connected by
 moist asbestus. This decomposition was likewise very slow;
 but in the , course of two days a pretty strong solution of
 lime was obtained in one tube, and an acid fluid in the other,
 which precipitated acetite of lead, and left a spot upon the
 glass from which it had been evaporated.
     Sulphate of barytes, as might be supposed, proved much
 more difficult of decomposition than either sulphate of stron
 tites or fluaie ot lime.  I had made four or five experiments
 upon     it,   with the same kind      of apparatus   that had been ap
                                                                       plied

  1 i         On some Chemical Agencies         of Ebectricity,
 plied to the fluate of lime, before I was able to gain decided
 results.     In the last process performed on this substance,
 two pieces of a large single crystal were hollowed by grind
 ing,   so as to contain about       five grains of water each ; they
 were connected by moist asbestus, and constantly subjected
 during four days to the strong action of a battery of 150 pairs
of plates of four inches square. As the water diminished,
its place was supplied by new quantities.               At the conclu
sion of the experiment the fluid on the positive side of th«
apparatus instantly reddened litmus, tasted very sour, and
gave a distinct precipitate with a solution of muriate of ba-
rytes ; the water on the other side deepened the tincture of
turmeric,      but did not render solution of sulphate of potash
turbid.      There was a small quantity of white crust, how
ever, on the sides and the bottom of the cavity, and I con
ceived that this might be the barytes, which, during the ex
tremely slow decomposition, would have combined with the
carbonic acid of the atmosphere.             To ascertain if this had
been the case,      I  introduced into the cavity a drop of diluted
muriatic acid     ; a slight effervescence     appeared, and the fluid
obtained occasioned a distinct white cloudiness in solution
of sulphate of      soda.
     In all these   cases the constituent parts     of the bodies newly
arranged     by   the   effects of electricity  existed  in considerable
quantities, and exposed on a large surface to its action.                 I
had great reason to believe, however, from the trials with
distilled water in different vessels, that very minute portions
of acid and alkaline matter might be disengaged by this
agency from solid combinations,              principally   consisting    of
the pure earths.
    This   part  of  the investigation was 'easily elucidated.
    For   a purpose       of geological inquiry, which on a future
occasion I shall have the honour of laying before the so
ciety, I had made a careful analysis of a specimen of fine
grained basalt from Port Rush, in the county of Antrim, by
means of fusion with boracic acid : it had afforded in 100
parts 3.i parts of soda, and nearly one-half a part of muri
atic acid, with 15 parts of lime.          This stone appeared to me
yery well fitted for the purpose of experiment           :  cavities were
                                                                   drilled

            On some Chemical Agencies        of Electricity.          i5
drilled in two pieces, properly shaped ; they contained about
twelve gains of water each ; they were connected by moist
ened amianthus-, and the process conducted, as usual, with
a power    of fifty   pairs of plates.   At the end of ten hours the
result was      examined with care.        The fluid that had been
positively electrified had the strong smell of oxymuriatic
acid, and copiously precipitated nitrate of silver ; the other
 portion of fluid affected turmeric, and left by evaporation a
substance which seemed to be a mixture            of lime and soda.
    A   part of  a  specimen   of compact zeolite, 'from the Giant's
 Causeway,       which by analysis     had given seven      parts in 10O
 of soda,   had a small cavity made in it ;       it was   immerged in
 pure water in a crucible of platina, and electrified in the
 game manner as the cube of Carrara marble, mentioned in
 page 9.      In   less than   two minutes the water in the cavity
 had gained      the property   of changing the colour of turmeric,
 and in half an hour the solution was disagreeably alkaline to
 the taste.     The matter dissolved proved to be soda and lime.
     Lepidolite, treated in the same way, gave potash.
     A piece of vitreous Java, from ./Etna, gave alkaline mat
 ter, which seemed to be a mixture of soda, potash, and
 lime.
     As in these trials the object was merely to ascertain the
 general fact of decomposition, the process was never con
 ducted for     a  sufficient time to develop    a  quantity  of alkaline
  matter capable      of being conveniently weighed, and of course
  any loss   of weight of the substance could not        be determined.
      I thought it right, however, to make one experiment of
  this kind, for the sake of removing every possibility of doubt
  on the source of the different products ; and I selected for
  this purpose glass, as a substance apparently insoluble in
  water, and not likely to afford in any way erroneous results.
      The balance that I employed was made for the Royal In
  stitution, by Mr. Fidler, after the model of that belonging
  to the Royal Society : it turns readily with -3-1^. of a grain
   when loaded with 100 grains on each side ; a glass tube with
   a platina wire attached, weighing 84 grains yW? was con
   nected with an agate cup by amianthus              ; they were filled
   With purified water, and electrified         by a power       from 150,
                                                                     pairs

 pairs  of plates, in such   a  way that the platina in the glass
 tube   was negative.     The   process was continued for four
 days, when the water was found alkaline.             It gave by eva
poration and exposure to a heat of about 400° Fahrenheit,
 soda mixed with a white powder insoluble in acids, the
whole weight     of which   was  TaT6j- faf a grain.   The  glass tube
carefully cleaned and dried weighed 84 grains -ft7. The
difference between the loss of weight of the tube and the
weight of the products in the water may be easily explained ;
some minute detached particles of amianthus were present,
and the soda must have contained water, a substance which
it  is probably perfectly free from in glass.
    Having obtained such results with regard to the disen
gagement of the saline parts of bodies insoluble in water,
I made a number of experiments on soluble compounds ;
their decomposition      was always much more rapid, and the
phaenomeha      perfectly distinct.
    In  these processes  I employed the agate cups with platina
wires,   connected   by amianthus moistened in pure water;
the solutions were introduced into the cups, and the elec
trifying power applied from batteries of fifty pairs of plates,
in   the usual way.
    A diluted solution of sulphate of potash treated in this
manner, produced in four hours at the negative wire a weak
lixivium of potash, and a solution of sulphuric acid at the
positive wire.
    The phenomena       were  similar when sulphate of soda, ni
trate of potash, nitrate of barytes, sulphate of ammonia,
phosphate of soda, succinate oxalate, and benzoate of am
monia,      and alum, were used.         The  acids in a certain time
collected in the tube containing the positive wire, and th«
alkalies and earths in that containing the negative wire.
    Solutions of the muriatic salts, decomposed in the same
way, uniformly      gave oxymuriatic      acid on the positive side.
    When compatible      mixtures   of   neutrosaline  solutions con
taining the common mineral acid were used, the different
acids and the different bases seemed to separate together in a
piixed state, without any respect to the orders of affinity.
    When metallic solutions     were employed, metallic crystals
                                                                    or

           On some Chemical Agencies           of Electricity.             17
or depositions were formed, as in common galvanic expe
riments, on the negative wire, and oxide was likewise de
posited round it ; and a great excess of acid was soon found
in the opposite cup. With solutions of iron, zinc, and tin,
this effect took place, as well as with the more oxidable me
tals : when muriate of iron was used, the black substance
deposited upon the wire was magnetic, and dissolved with
effervescence in muriatic acid; and when sulphate of zinc
was used,    agray powder possessed of the metallic lustre,
and likewise soluble with effervescence, appeared ; and in all
cases acid in excess was exhibited on the positive side.
   Strong or saturated saline solutions, as might have been
expected, afforded indications of the progress of decompo
sition much more rapidly than weak ones; but the smallest
proportion of neutrosaline matter seemed to be acted on with
energy.
  A     very simple experiment demonstrates this last principle.
If a piece    of paper tinged with turmeric is plunged into pure
water in a proper circuit in contact with the negative point,
the very minute quantity of saline compound contained in
the paper affords alkaline matter sufficient to give it instantly
a brown  tint near its point of contact; and acid in the same
manner is immediately developed from litmus paper at the
positive surface.
  I   made several experiments               of ascertaining
                                        with the view
whether in the decompositions by electricity the separation
of the constituent parts was complete from the last portions
of the compound; and whenever the results were distinct,
this evidently appeared to be the case.
   I shall describe one of the most conclusive                  of the experi
ments: — A       very weak solution      of sulphate of potash, con
taining twenty parts      of water    one part saturated solu
                                        and
tion, at 64°, was electrified in the two agate cups by the
power of fifty pairs of plates for three days: the connecting
amianthus, which had been moistened with pure water, was
removed, washed with pure water, and again applied, twice
every    day;    by this precaution      the   presence     of any neutral
salt that might       adhere to   it,   and disturb       the    results, was
prevented. The alkali obtained in this             process        in the solu-

 Asiatic Researches, or Memoirs of the Society established

     Although these formulae must have been known in Eu

 first at Calcutta, and since reprinted in London, are very
 rare in France, we thought it our duty to announce them
to our readers,       many   of whom, most likely,        have not heard
of them.
     Ducham, Bailly, and Le Gentil, have mentioned that the
Indians possess methods of computing eclipses, which they
follow without understanding.             Mr. Davis, the English au
thor of this memoir, has attacked this assertion victoriously,
by giving at full length the computation of the eclipse of the
moon of November 1789, by means of the Indian formulae',
of which        he has given the demonstration and explanation1
according to the Souria Siddaiita.             Want of room obliges

revised     the computations     with attention, and that, excepting
a few points of the Indian doctrine, and a few suppositions.

F. L. S. — The ingenious method contained in this paper for computing Sims,
and explained by M. Ddambre, is curious, aad will prore interesting to our
astronomical readers.
                                                                   ad nut:

  admit    :   but I cannot forbear saying a few words on the In-*
 dian tables of sines, and of trie two methods by which they
 .have been        computed ; for, since they have been printed, I
  have found that in the note put at the bottom of this table
  I have not sufficiently appreciated the excellence of the me
 thod, from having been drawn into an error by a constant
 number, which does not appear to have been given accu
  rately enough in the memoir.
      In this table the sines are expressed in minutes; they pro
 ceed by intervals of 3f degrees, and suppose the radius 3438,
 or rather 3437-75. On the side of the right sines it gives the
 versed sines.
      If we examine the process recommended by the Indian
 author, we readily perceive that his method is reduced to the
 computing beforehand a first difference, which is at the same
 time the first sine           of  the table    ;   after which, to obtain the
 second      sine, he calculates the second difference, which he
 subtracts from the first difference                ;  this gives him the first
 difference between the first and second sine, and then the
 second sine        : after this he computes another second differ
 ence, to obtain a new first difference and a new sine, and so
 on to the end            of  the table.        This process is exactly that
 which      1  have pointed       out in the preface to Borda's Decimal
 Tables,       without knowing that the method which appeared
 unknown even to the moderns, had been practised so long
 ago in India.

    It    is evident that,
                        excepting a few sines, in which we
differ some tenths, the agreement is perfect throughout the
table ; but with the divisor 225 we obtain only the three
first sines with any accuracy, after which the error increases
very rapidly.        I suppose this                false    divisor is only a repeti
tion     of the divisor 225, which                  served to find the first   of the
first differences.
  The Indian author does not show how he found his di
visor; we can therefore only examine it by the work : now
the work shows that a divisor differing very little from mine
must be used.
    This      process                 nothing like it is to
                              is extremely curious            ;
be found in Ptolemy's Trigonometry,    and all the authors
on that subject were turned over to no purpose before we
could find any vestige of till we came to Briggs, who was
                                         it,
acquainted with this divisor, which he appeared to have
discovered          by
             the work, after comparing the second differ
ences found out               by
                  other methods.   Briggs himself did not
know that          it   was the    square      of   the chord        of   the differential
arc A A.
    But  may be asked why the Indians have made A A =
          it
3° 45' instead of 1°.  The following,    think,   the rea     I                 is
son;     it
        appears  to carry great probability: —  cannot  be                    It
doubted that the Indians were acquainted with the following
theorems   s*,A + t*,A = rad.*; ver. sin,A = rad.— cos,A
               :
=    2iJ,iA    ;        whence     s,i   A     =     (±    rad.     —   .J.   CjA)'''.     Now
these three theorems are sufficient to find all the sines                                of their
table, and will not give any other: they have therefore done
all that they were able to do, and their tabic shows us the bounds
of their knowledge: we see, indeed,           2tX), that they have

actually used these three formula? to compute their table, and
that they knew, besides, that 5,30" =     rad., which appears .J.
to leave not   doubt respecting what have said. Their table

being constructed, they then examined the first and second
differences, and remarked that the first constantly decreased,
but they could not immediately perceive according to what
law; the second differences, on the contrary, continually
increased, and           it   was not      ifficult to perceive that they *ere

proportional to the sine : thus the second difference opposite
30° is 7-36, and that opposite 90° is 14'72, double of the
former         :    and to find the ratio             of   the second difference to the
sine they divided the radius 3-137'75 by 14-72, and they
found 233-53 for their quotient : dividing thus each sine by
its second difference they constantly found this same quo
tient, whence they concluded that^to obtain this second dif
ference it was only necessary to divide the sine by 233-53.
     The rule for            the    first differences          is not so simple ; for the
difference           of s,A = ,2s,\ Ac,(A +                    ,£•   AA),     and the       5,(A.-f
£    A A),         are not in the table.
     But the first           of the first differences                is   at the same time the
first sine          of    whence they Concluded, that with the
                         the table   ;
first sine, and the first of thd first and second differences,
they were fully prepared for computing all the rest: but in
the work the table was already computed throughout, when
itgave them their differential method; and the proof of this
is, that           to make their table as they have
                                          given   they had                           it
occasion to make the first sine 224-85 and not 225, which
would have given the first differences                               a    little too great, and
the sines too small.
     It   is       true the Souria Siddanta recommends to divide the
number of minutes                    in   a    sign   Ly   8   to obtain           the   first sine,
which      is       the same       as   making the sine equal to the                     arc; thus

every degree    but these interpolated degrees would have had
                         ;
their signs less accurate, and they have preferred giving those
which result immediately from their formulae, to preserve in

all its purity the table which was to serve for computing all
die others : but they have given their tables of the equation
of the centre for        every degree.
     Their theory for computing           these tables  of equations was
incomplete and inaccurate ; although they used epicycles,
like the Greeks, to compute the inequalitietuof the planets,
this calculation was with them less geometric than those of
Ptolemy. They had introduced an empiric correction, which
was very badly conceived ; and they supposed that from 90°
to 180° the same equations returned in an inverted order.
The Greeks, in this respect; were further advanced than the
Hindoos        ;  their trigonometry was much more complete, al
though that of the Hindoos had a greater resemblance to
ours; and the Hindoos appear to have had some theorems
unknown          to the Greeks. These tables of equations, although
defective, are, nevertheless, very curious: in the explanation
of them given by the Hindoos we observe lhat the differ
ences       of   the  equation are proportional to the «ine of the
anomaly ; or, which is nearly the same, that the variation
of the sine is proportional to the cosine.
     It  is evident      also  from   this memoir,     that   the Hindoos
found       the latitude of      a place by computing       the   length    of
the shadow           of a   gnomon,     especially when the gun was in
 the equator;        they miaht have found it also by the           solstitial
 shadow, using the sun's greatest declination,              which accord
 ing to them was 24°.
     To determine their longitudes           they observed    eclipses, and
 compared them with the computations made from their lunar
 tables adapted to their first meridian.
     In   page 315 is shown their method         of calculating the sun's
 right ascension by means            of their sines, without knowing
 the tangents.
      In   the same     place is .also shown     how they computed the
 ascensional differences and           the point of the equator which
 rises with each sign.           The table which they made has been
  published by        M. Le Gentil, who acknowledged he was un*
 acquainted with the principle on which it was constructed :
  this principle is givcu in the memoir, and I have explained
  it at full length in a note.

       We shall not enter into any discussion respecting              the anti
    quity of the Sonria Siddanta* : by only considering               the form
   of their tables, their    ideas of the precession of the equinoxes,
   their obliquity of 24°, and their theory of eclipses, we be
   lieve the authors of the Hindoo astronomical books more
   amient than the astronomers of Alexandria.                   On the other
   hand, when \ve find things known to them that were un
   known      to the Greeks, v\e should be inclined to consider
   them of a more recent date.             The system of epicycles for
   the planets is common to them both, but less perfect than
   that of the Greeks ; whence we may conjecture that this doc
   trine   of  the  Indians    passed from them to Greece, where                 it
  was extended       and improved.      It  appears less natural to sup
   pose that the    Hindoos received them from the Greeks through
   the intermedium of the Arabs, on account of the imper
  fect and disfigured theories which arc found among them.
  We can, however, affirm         that this memoir, although nothing
  is to be obtained from it that can improve our present know
  ledge or the progress of astronomy, is nevertheless extremely
  curious,     and   worthy the attention of astronomers.                What
  render's the reading     of it more difficult is, the great number
  of Indian technical words contained in the translation.
  They ought       to have   given a second version, in which there
  should have been no other than their own language: I had
  that idea, but to execute        it completely some notions were
 necessary      which   I could not obtain, and some researches
 to which      I had not time to attend.
      In  the same memoir we observe           that  the    great   period of
 the Indians,       which is 4,320,000 years,         is only an astrono
 mical period, at the beginning of which the mean longi
 tudes, the aphelia, and the nodes of all the planets were no
 thing. At the end of this memoir we find another tending
 to prove that the Indian zodiac has not been borrowed either
 frqiTi the Greeks or the       Arahs.    We find also two memoirs'
 on Indian chronology by sir William Jones.

III.  Problems on the Reduction     of Angles. By T. S. EVANS,
    F.L.S., of   the  Royal Military Academy, Woolwich*.
 JL HE following problems       are concerning      the reduction     of
angles from one point or plane to another.              They are not
all of them new.       One or two, with      their    solutions, will
be found among the writings       of  each  of the following      cele
brated mathematicians     ; Boscovich,     Cagnoli, Carnot,        De-
lambre, and probably some others : but few, if any of them,
have ever been published by our English authors.                It was
therefore thought, if their solutions were given in one uni-,
form manner, in our own language, they might be of ser
vice  ; and this is what I have here attempted, with a few
additions   of my own.                            '
   As they   bear a very near relation to both plane and spheric
trigonometry,     but cannot,    with propriety,       be considered
as  actually belonging   to either   of them separately, I         have
taken the liberty of classing them under the title of Gonio-
metry.
   Their utility will  be evident to every person who has any
concern in geodesic operations. It seldom happens in prac
tice that all the three objects at the angular points of a tri
angle are situated precisely in the horizontal plane passing
through the observer's eye ; therefore when one or two of
them are above or below that plane the angles are different,
and   will require to be reduced   to what they would        be  if the

                                                                  three

three objects were exactly on the same level : otherwise the
positions, if put down in a map, would be erroneous, as the
distances between    them would be too great.  This reduction
is easily effected by the assistance of gomometry.
   When an instrument similar to colonel Mudge's is made
use of, having both an altitude and azimuth circle, it is clear
all the angles, being referred to one horizon, require no
further reduction than what is necessary to be allowed on
account        of    the earth's sphericity.            But       if,   instead      of   an    in
strument of this kind,              a   sextant be used,                and     some      of the
objects be elevated or depressed,                  then the angles, not being
all of them referred to the horizon, will require                                    the aid     of
our theorems to reduce them to this plane.
     Before we enter upon our subject we shall premise the
following particulars           :
   In the first place. all geodesic angles of elevation                                   are   af
fected        by   the horizontal   refraction      ;   it   is   therefore necessary
to show how the quantity                of   it   may be found.
                   To determine     the horizontal Refraction.
     Rays      of light which        pass through the atmosphere,                               and
which        are neither reflected       nor absorbed               by    it,   do not pro
ceed     in   a straight line, but are continually bent towards the
earth    as   they go on for they change their direction in pass
                            ;
ing obliquely from one medium to another of        different                     a
density   as for example, when they pass from air to water,
          ;
or from glass to air.               The atmosphere being composed of
an  infinity of layers, whose densities increase as they ap
proach the earth, the rays of light, as they pass through,
undergo the same change as                if
                                 they had passed successively
through an infinity of different mediums: they must there
fore be inflected towards the earth in proportion as the den
sity increases.   But as the density of the air at different                                    al
titudes does not alter suddenly, but slowly, or     insensible                  by
degrees, the rays of light do not describe   polygon in pass      a
ing through the atmosphere, but    regular curve line that
                                                   a                                             is
concave towards the earth's surface. The effect of refrac-r
tion    is    therefore    to make objects appear                     higher above the
horizo'u than what they really are.
                                                                                       Hence

     Hence it is evident that the point B (fig. 1.) viewed at A
will   appear elevated to D, and that A seen from B will be
elevated       to   E. Let two observers, at the same moment, take
the zenith distances         of these two objects. Let the zenith
distance of B, observed at           A,      be, on account               of       the refrac
tion,    ZAD;          of A from B, xBE : now, supposing
                       and that
A and B to be at equal distances from C, then by drawing
the line AG through A parallel to EF, it is evident, since
the angle GAG = ACF,
          that BAC = 90" —        ACB, and
               DAC = 180         ZAD;        --fr
therefore taking their difference BAD = 90° +    ACB —                             £
ZAD; whence ZAB = 90° + C, or the true zemth di     -J-
stance of one object seen from the other    equal to 90° plus       is
half the contained terrestrial arc. Therefore      comparing                  by
the observed angles with this when the earth's radius and
the distance of the objects are known, the effect of the hori
zontal refraction will be had.
     When one of the              places     is     above the earth's               surface,     as
at E, then,     nearly the same mode of reasoning, we find
                      by
ZEB + zBE     =   180° + C: but in this case AE and BE
are easily obtained, which will give the angles CEB and
ABE, and consequently ZEB and sBE; whence            com                               by
parison,         as   before mentioned,             the horizontal             refraction         is
obtained.

  horizontal refraction have been made, and compared with
  the terrestrial arc, a sufficiently accurate rule may be de
  duced for correcting the observations in all cases, without
  finding how much it amounts to in every instance. Colonel
  Mudge has taken it at -^th of the contained arc (Trigono
  metrical Survey, parti p. 173); and as the instruments
  which this ingenious gentleman made usc of were of the
  best kind and used with the utmost care, there seems to be
  greater reason to depend      upon     his results than upon those
 of any other person.
     In some   geodesic    operations it happens that we have to
 resolve a triangle which has one angle very obtuse or very
  acute.   Let ABC (fig. 2.) be an oblique angled triangle,
 whose vertical angle A is very obtuse ; and having given the
 two sides together with this angle, let it be required to de
 termine the base    BC.

 and when the angle is very acute,
                 BAC" = R"         y          (BC   - D).
     In carrying on       a series  of triangles it    is usual to select
  such objects for the angular points as are most distinctly to
  be seen from each other on account of their elevation ; and
  among them it frequently happens that the pointed spire of
  a steeple, or the flagstaff on the top of a tower, is chosen.
  This object, perhaps, ran be observed extremely well from
  the other two angular points of the triangle, and the spire
  or flagstaff bisected by the vertical wire of the telescope with
  the greatest   accuracy.       But  as it is desirable to measure all
  three of the angles of      each   triangle, we often find, to our
  great mortification,     that when the instrument is removed to
   this third object   it cannot   be so placed as to have its centre
   immediately under or over the centre of the flagstaff or spire
                                                                       that

that was bisected ; and even if it could, the walls of the
building would prevent the angle from being measured. The
three following problems show the method of obtaining this
angle when the instrument, for the reasons just given, has
necessarily been placed on one side of this centre.
                                           Problem     I.
  In measuring the angles of                         the  triangle ABC (fig. 4.),
suppose the angular point A to                       be in the centre of a steeple,
where the instrument cannot be placed to observe the quan
tity of the angle BAC.
   Let D be a convenient place situated on the line AC for
fixing the instrument, when on account of some impediment
it cannot be used at A. Then let the angles CBA, CBD be
observed at B, and let the angle CDB be observed at D :
these         will   be sufficient to determine the three angles               of the
        ABC.

  For CBA                -
              CBD = DBA, and CAB = CDB                DBA;                 -
whence, as A and CBA are known, ACB is known also.
  If D were the place of the steeple, and A the station fixed
upon, then CDB = CAB + ABD, which reduces the angle
A to that at D. But it seldom happens that the object C
can be seen from A through the steeple at D ; therefore in
general it is necessary to choose the station D within the
triangle     ABC, or on one side of A.
  If      the angle DBA cannot be observed from B,                        some prac
tical method must be had recourse to for determining it.
Thus,

    If the station d be so chosen that the angle CdB may be
equal to the angle CDB, then the three angles of the tri
angle ABC may be obtained without actually measuring
either of them.         For, when CDB = C^B a circle will pass
through the four points CDdB and BCD + BdD = 180° =
CDcZ + CBd; therefore BCD = 180°                  - BdD, also CBd —
 ISO0 — CDc?and A = CDd + BdD — 180°; whence the
three    angles   A, B, C,    are obtained      by only measuring   the
two CDd       and   BdD.

angle                                   +   DCA).
    If the steeple were       at  D and the station     at A, then the

    In this case, CFB = FAB + FBA = CDF + FCD;
therefore FAB = CDF + FCD                   -   FBA; whence we get
the angle CAB = CDB + ACD                   -  DBA.

     • This problem may be resolved by spherics in the following manner :
    Let SBDA (fig. JO-) be the same figure as fig. 9, having PSD perpendicular
 to the plane SBA; and suppose 7, to be the zenith of the station S, then the
 arc ZC will be the complement of the angle of elevation DSB, and the arc CE
 will measure the oblique angle DS-V, also the arc ZE will be W; hence we
 have the three sides ZC, CE, EZ,to find the quantity of the an^le CZ11, which
 it is evident %yll be equal to the angle USA ; for it is proved by the writers on
 spherics, that the spheric angle C/.li is equal to the angle formed by thc two
 tangents intersecting at Z; but these two tangents would be parallel to the
 lines AS.BS, intersecting at S, therefore life angle CZK is equal to the angle
 ESA. The triangle in this instance being rcctilateral, we may consult Cag-

IV.    On the Formation         of tlte Bark of Trees. In a Letter
   from    T.  A.   KNIGHT, Esq. F. R. S. to the Right Honour
    able Sir JOSEPH BANKS, A'. B. P. II. S. &c*
  .     MY DEAR SIR,
AN      extraordinary diversity of opinion appears to have pre
vailed among naturalists, respecting the production and sub
sequent     state   of the bark    of   trees.
    According to the theory of Malpighi, the cortical subr
stance, which is annually generated, derives its -origin from
the older bark ; and the interior part of this new substance
is annually transmuted into alburnum, or sap wood ; whilst
the exterior part, becoming dry and lifeless, forms the ex
terior covering, or cortex.
    The opinions of Grew do not appear                    to differ  much from
those of Malpighi ; but he conceives                     the   interior bark to
consist    of two distinct substances, one of which becomes
alburnum, whilst the other remains in the state of bark : lie,
however,       supposes the insertments in the wood, the " utri-
culi" of Malpighi, and the " tissu cellulaire" of Du Hamel,
to have originally existed in the bark.
    Hales on the contrary contends, that the bark derives its
 existence from the alburnum, and that it docs not undergo
 any subsequent transformation.
    The discoveries of Du Ilamel                 have      thrown    much light
 on the subject ; but his experiments do not afford any con-
 elusive result, and some of them may be adduced in support
 of either of the preceding hypotheses : and a modern writer
 (Mirbclf) has endeavoured to combine aud reconcile, in
 some degree, the apparently discordant theories of Malpiahi
 and Hales. He contends rtith Hales, that the alburnum gives
 existence to the new layer qf bark ; but that this bark sub
 sequently changes into alburnum ; though not precisely in
 the manner described by Malpighi.
     So much difference of opinion, amongst men so capable
 of observing, sufficiently evinces the difficulty of the subject

 they endeavoured to investigate : and in the course of experi
 ments which has occupied more than twenty years, I have
 scarcely felt my self prepared till the present time, even to give
 an opinion respecting the manner in which the cortical sub
 stance is generated in the ordinary course of its growth ; or
 reproduced, when that, which previously existed, has been
 taken off.
      Du Hamcl        has shown,   that the    bark   of   some   species   of
trees is readily reproduced,        when the decorticated surface of
 the alburnum         is secluded from the air ; and I have repeated
similar experiments on the apple, the sycamore, and other
trees, .with the same result ; I have also often observed a
similar reproduction of bark on the surface of the alburnum
of the Wych elm (Ulmus montana) in sliady situations,
when no covering whatever was applied.     A glareous fluid,
as Du Hamel has stated, exudes from the surface of the al
burnum : this fluid appears to change into a pulpous unor
ganised mass, which subsequently becomes organised and
cellular; and the matter, which enters into the composition
of this cellular substance, is evidently derived from the al
burnum.
   These      facts   therefore extremely favourable to the
                       are
theory of Hales ;   but  other facts may "be adduced which
are scarcely consistent with that theory,
   The internal surface of pieces of bark, when deiached from
contact with the alburnum, provided they remain united to the
tree at their upper ends, much more readily generate a new
bark, than the alburnum does under similar circumstances :
a similar .fluid exudes from the surfaces of both, and the
same phaenomena          are observable   in both cases.     The cellular
substance, however, which is thus generated,             though it pre
sents every external appearance           of  a perfect bark, is inter
nally very imperfectly organised ;          and the vessels which con
tain the true sap in the bark, are still wanting ; and I have
found, that these may be made, by appropriate management,
to traverse the new cellular substance in almost any direction.
When I cut off all communication above, and on one side,
between the old bark and           that substance,     I observed, that
the vessels    proceeded     across   it,   from the old bark on the
                                                                     other

other side, taking always in a greater or less degree an incli
nation downwards ; and when the cellular substance re
mained united to the bark at its upper end only, the vessels
descended nearly perpendicularly down it ; but they did not
readily ascend into   when   it,was connected with the bark
                                            it
at its lower extremity only            :   the result of similar experiments,
when made          on      different       species     of trees, was, however,
subject to some variations.
    Pieces of bark of the walnut-tree,                     which    were two inches
broad, and four long, having been detached from contact
with the alburnum, except at their upper ends, and covered
with plaister composed of bees- wax and turpentine, in some
       a
instances, and with clay only in others, readily generated
the cellular substance of new bark  and between that and
                                       a                 ;
the old detached            bark very nearly             as   much alburnum       was
deposited     as   in other
                        parts               of      the tree,    where the bark re
tained its natural position; which,    think, affords very de

cisive evidence of the descent of the sap through the bark.
Similar pieces of bark, under the same mode of treatment,
but united to the tree at their lower ends only, did not long
remain alive, except at their lower extremities   and there              ;
a very little alburnum only was generated.   Other pieces of
bark of the same dimensions, which were laterally united to
the tree, continued alive almost to their extremities                        ;   and   a
considerable portion of alburnum was generated, particularly
near their lower edges; the sap appearing in its passage across
the bark to have been given    considerable inclination down
                                            a
wards   :probably owing to an arrangement in the organisa
tion  of the bark, that   have noticed in
                                   I         former memoir*,    a
which renders    better calculated to transmit the sap towards
                      it
the roots than in any other direction.
 I  have in very few instances been able to make the walnut-
treereproduce its bark from the alburnum, though under
the same management    rarely failed to succeed with the sy~

  upwards by capillary attraction, when the proper action of
  the cortical vessels is necessarily suspended.
      The preceding experiments, and the authority of Du
  Harhel,    having perfectly satisfied me, ,that both the albur
  num and bark of trees are capable of generating a new bark,
  or at least of transmitting a fluid capable of generating a cel
  lular substance, to which the bark in its more perfectly or
 ganised state owes its existence, my attention was directed
  to discover the sources from which this fluid is derived.
 Both     the bark and the alburnum                of  trees are composed
 principally of two substances ; one of which consists of Ipng
 tubes, and the other is cellular; and the cellular substance
 of    the bark is  in contact with the similar substance in the
 alburnum, and through these I have long suspected the true
 sap to pass from the vessels of the bark to those of the albur
 num*. The intricate mixture of the cellular and vascular
 substances     long baffled my endeavours to discover from
 which of them, in the preceding cases, the sap, and conse
 quently the new bark, proceeded ; but               I was ultimately suc
 cessful.
    The cellular substance, both in the alburnum and bark of
 old pollard oaks, often exists in masses of near a line in
width, and this organisation was peculiarly favourable to my
 purpose.     I  therefore repeated on the trunks of trees of this
kind, experiments similar to those above mentioned which
were made on the walnut-tree.
    Apparently owing to the small quantity of sap, which the
old pollard trees contained, their bark was very imperfectly
reproduced ; but I observed a fluid to ooze from the cellular
substance, both of the bark and alburnum ; and on the sur
face of these substances alone, in many instances, the new
bark was reproduced in small detached pieces.
    I  have endeavoured      to prove in former         communicationst,
that the true sap     of trees acquires       those properties which di
stinguish it from the fluid recently absorbed, by circulating
through the leaf; and that it descends down the bark, where
part   of it is employed in generating               the  new substances

annually added to the tree; and that the remainder, not thus
expended, passes into the alburnum, and there joins the
ascending current of sap.        The cellular substance, both of
 the bark and alburnum, has been proved, in the preceding
experiments, to be capable of affording the sap a passage
through it; and therefore it appears not very improbable,
that it executes an office similar to that of the anastomosing
vessels of the animal economy, when the cellular surfaces of
the bark and alburnum are in contact        with each other ; and,
when detached, it may be inferred, that the passing fluid will
exude from both surfaces : because almost all the vessels of
trees appear to be capable     of  an  inverted action    in giving
motion to the fluids which they carry.
   As the power of generating a new bark appeared in the
preceding cases to exist alike in the sap of the bark and of
the alburnum,      I was  anxious to discover how far the fluid,
which ascends through the central vessels of the succulent
annual shoot, is endued with similar powers. Having there
fore made     two circular   incisions   through the bark, round
the stems    of several annual shoots of the vine, as early in the
summer     as the alburnum within them had acquired sufficient
maturity to perform its office of carrying up the sap, I took
off  the bark between these incisions ; and I abraded the sur
face of the alburnum to prevent a reproduction of it.           The
alburnum in the decorticated spaces soon became externally
dry and lifeless j and several incisions were then made lon
gitudinally through it. The incisions commenced a little
above, and extended below the decorticated spaces, so that,
if the sap of the central vessels generated a cellular substance
(as I concluded it would),
                               thaj substance might come into
contact and form a union with the substance           of  the  same
kind emitted by the bark above and below.
   The experiment succeeded perfectly, and        the cellular sub
stances generated    by the central vessels,   and the bark,   soon
united,   and a perfect vascular bark was subsequently formed
beneath the alburnum, and appeared perfectly to execute the
office of that which had been taken off; the medulla appeared
to be wholly inactive.

to occur beneath the old bark, when united to the alburnum,
For, having attentively examined, through every part of the
f>prin<r and summer, the formation of the internal bark, and

                                                  I
fectly consistent with the preceding observations. A single
shoot only was suffered to spring from each root and stem,
and from the base of this in every instance the cortical ves
sels dispersed            themselves        in    different directions.              Some de
scended perpendicularly downwards, whilst others diverged
on each side, round the alburnum, with more or less incli
nation downwards, and met on the opposite side of it. The
same pulpous and cellular substance appeared to cover the
surfaces of the bark and alburnum,                                when in contact with
each other,          as    when detached              ;    and through this substance
the ramifications               of    the vessels          of   the   new bark extended
themselves, appearing to receive their direction from the
fluid sap which descended from the bark of the young shoots,
and not to be,             in   any degree, influenced in their course                           by
the direction taken                 the cortical and alburnous vessels of
                                     by
the preceding year.
     Whenever         the vessels          of    the bark,       which proceeded from
different points,           met each other, an interwoven texture was
produced, and the alburnum beneath acquired similar orga                    a
nisation and the same thing occurs, and

important effects,   the ordinary course of the growth of
                                 in
trees.      The bark of              the principal         stem, and       of    every lateral
branch, contains very 'numerous vessels, which are charged
with the descending true sap  and at the juncture of the

A    kind of pedestal of alburnum, the texture of which                                          is
much interwoven,       in consequence formed round the base

of the     lateral    branch         ;    which thus        becomes        firmly united     to

the reproduced buds of the preceding experiment, bud's were
inserted in the foregoing summer, or attached     grafting in                by
the spring; and,   when  these succeeded, though they were
in many instances taken from trees of different specie*, and
even        of different genera, no
                             sensible' difference existed in the
vessels, which appeared to diverge into the bark of the stock,
 from these buds and from those reproduced in the preceding

 the bark of the stocks                  ;   ami   it   does not appear probable, even
 without referring                to the preceding facts,    that vessels should
 be extended,               in   a     few days,         by

 roots; which                are,     in many instances,               more than two hun

  matter, which composes the new bark, acquires an organi
  sation calculated to transmit the true sap towards the roots,
  as thai fluid          progressively descends from the leaves in the
  spring:           but whether the matter, which enters into the com
  position          of    the new bark,          be derived from     the bark or the
  alburnum, in the ordinary course of the growth                               of the     tree,
  it will be extremely difficult to ascertain.
    It       is,
          however, no difficult task to prove, that the bark docs
 not, in all cases, spring from the alburnum      for many cases    ;
 may be adduced in which          always generated previously to
                                                it   is
 the existence of the alburnum beneath it: but none, believe,                   I
 in which               the external       surface ot the alburnum
                                                exists previ

 tical substance has been taken off, as in the preceding ex
 periments.                 In   the radicle     of germinating seeds, the cortical
 vessels elongate, and new portions                       of bark are successively
 added to their points,                    many days before any alburnous sub
 stance           is    generated     in   them   and;    the succulent annual

 shoot the formation of the bark long precedes that of the
 alburnum.    In the radicle the sap appears also evidently to
 descend* through the cortical vesselsf, and in the succulent
 annual shoot               it     as evidently passes up through              the    central
vessels^, which surround the medulla.                          In both cases     cel  a
 lular substance, similar to that which                        was generated in the
preceding experiments,                     is   first formed, and this cellular sub
stance in the same manner subsequently becomes vascular                                     ;
whence    appears, that the true sap, or blood of the plant,
                  it
produces similar effects, and passes through similar stages of
organisation, when    flows from different sources, and that

V.   Observations upon the crystallized            Bodies contained in
                  Lava.      By M. G. A.      DE Luc.
                     [Concluded from voL xxvii. p. 312.]
J ODGINO from        volcanic phaenomena,         what depth may we
presume the fires to be, compared with the diameter and the
mass of the globe ? This depth is more or less considerable,
without doubt, according to the mass of the volcano that is
elevated : thus it is very probable that the fires of Etna, of
the peak   of Teneriffb,   and  of the volcanoes     of Peru, are deeper
than those    of Vesuvius, Vulcano,      and    Stromboli. This is all
we can venture to say, but we cannot hazard any thing upon
the causes or events        which have conduced to the formation
of our globe.
   "   Man     separates,   dissolves, concentrates and combines
the minerals,     producing changes in their forms :" all this is
true  ; he does so    by solvents, and by the fire of his furnaces.
But it  is not added that he cannot again by any means recall
them to their state of mineralisation, by any fire what
ever.    Neither can we regenerate the vegetables which we
burn and reduce to ashes; nor can the chemist reproduce the
substances he decomposes : we are therefore very far from
being able to produce any thing similar to the rocks, the
crystals, and the minerals of our mountains.              This reflection
alone overturns every system which maintains that these
substances are formed by fire, since all the operations both
of natural and artificial fire, with which we are acquainted,
can produce nothing        like them.
                                                                   These

  44                      Observations     upon the
     These limit..,     which  the resources     of matl cannot pass,
 should render us very circumspect in the results we at
 tribute to them, since none of the substances in nature, which
 man destroys or alters, can again appear, except by pursuing
 the laws and the course established by the Creator from the
 origin of things.
     M.   Fleuriau de Bellevuc mentions          a  singular production
 of a lime furnace, which        lie quotes as    an example in favour
 of his  system    :
                      "  This production," he says, " resembles in
 its interior certain horny rocks of the Alps, and some com
 pact and homogeneous lava.              Its exterior is full of bubbles
 like those of lava, its surface is covered with a yellow ena
 mel, and its cavities are overspread with small crystals :"
 and he adds in a note,        "  Let it not be supposed that these
 kinds of stones have fallen accidentally into these furnaces;
 that is impossible."
    I shall not make any direct objection on this head; I must
be first acquainted with the production alluded to, and parti
cularly with the neighbourhood of the lime kiln in question.
But I shall offer one general observation, which may throw
some light upon its        origin.    Examples are frequent of there
being introduced among the broken calcareous stones, frag
ments of other stones, to which the workmen pay no atten
tion,   and which are only perceived        when the lime is extracted     :
there is then found, instead of apiece of lime, a stone covered
on its surface with a vitreous varnish, which on being broken
shows granite, serpentine,          or any other vitrescible rock :
ihese examples are frequent in the lime             kilns in our neigh
bourhood.        In  order to be convinced that no such fragments
can be introduced, it must first be proved that there are no
calcareous rocks in the country exempt from quartzose or si
liceous nuclei,      and that there are no      otlitr kinds of rocks,
belonging to the soil, or adventitious.           It is also very proba
ble,   and  I  am   persuaded   of it from   a great number of exam
ples, that the production of the lime kiln mentioned is owing
to some ether kind        of stone than     the species intended to be
calcined in it.
    "The      naturalists,"    M.   Fleuriau    de Bellevue     proceeds,
" who    still think that the rucks upon which          the volcanic fires
                                                                     have

             crystallized   Bodies contained in Lava.                45
have acted have undergone an incomplete fusion only, and
that their crystals remained untouched in the middle of their
fluid paste,   are obliged   to have recourse     to a multitude     of
suppositions,    in order to explain the state in which           lavas
are when cooled."
   These naturalists have      recourse   to no such supposition.
Nothing    changes the form      or the nature of lava after it has
cooled.    The foreign      substances    which it contains      in its
burning   paste,   remain in the same       form   ;  no changes    are
produced, the fire of the volcanoes not having had power
sufficient to fuse or alter them.       I have given a great num
ber of examples of this.
    I shall call oti this occasion to the recollection of my
readers, the idea    I presented in my former memoir, upon the
probable state in which the subterranean volcanoes were
from whence the lava issued. We see that, in order to reduce
the rocks and the minerals to fusion, they must be broken
into pieces : nevertheless there are no stampers or grinding
machines in the strata where the lavas take their origin, and
the volcanic fires, any more than those of our furnaces, can
not melt rocks in large masses.       One would think, therefore,
that in such beds the chemical affinities may be exercised, and
form isolated and grouped crystals which remain enveloped
in the matter in fusion.        How   does   this fusion take place,
and whence proceed the fires that produce it          ? We see from
the various emanations that sulphur         is the   chief ingredientx
and that   iron enters into the mixture      ; that  the marine acid
and sal-ammoniac also form parts of the mixture : but what
circumstance, what combination is requisite to excite the
fermentation which produces the fires, the fusions, and the
other volcanic phenomena?          Upon this we can only form
conjectures, some of which may approach nearer to the truth
than others.     But as all the means in our power can neither
hinder nor produce any thing, it is of little importance to
know upon what our conjectures are founded as to the origin
of these fires, and the manner in which they act. What is
essentially requisite, is, to take care not to give them a wider
influence, nor to attribute more action to them, than they
                                                                 really

  46                    Observations upon the
 really have,    that we may not found systems upon mistakes
 or exaggerations.
     M.   Fleuriau   de Bellevne does not admit that sea water is
 absolutely necessary tor producing volcanoes ; and he quotes
 against this opinion, which seemed at first very alluring, a
 volcanic eruption related by Messrs. llumboldt and Bonplaud,
 which took place, in 17A9, " in a plain of Mexico, forty
 leagues from the tea in a straight line ; an eruption which ele
 vated in one    night  a' volcano 1494 feet high, surrounded by
 more than two thousand mouths, which still smoke."
     If burning  volcanoes could be manifested any where other
 wise than under the influence of the waters of the ocean, we
 should not need to confine ourselves to a single example ; a
 great number in that case would certainly be produced ; and
 if this were the case, the opinion I have hazarded would ne
 ver have come into my mind.            But after having directed my
 attention to the great fact, that there is no burning volcano
 whatever in inland districts     ;  that no expanse can be pro
 duced    of fresh water,    however vast it may be, having ever
 produced any volcano ; that all of them are near the sea, or
 encompassed by it ; and having observed that the smoke of
volcanoes deposits marine acid in abundance ; I drew this
unavoidable conclusion from all these circumstances, that
 sea water is absolutely necessary, from the salts it holds in
solution,    for producing the fermentations which raise and
keep up     volcanoes.
    This conclusion has been since confirmed by the eruptions
 of water from the volcanoes of Iceland, \vhich deposit ma
rine salt in great abundance ; and lately also by an observa
tion of Messrs. Humboldt and De Buch, who were witnesses
of the eruption of Vesuvius in the month of August 1605,
and     saw the sides  of a crevice of its crater covered with       a
crust of muriate of soda two or three inches in thickness.
    From which it results that      the fact quoted by   M. Fleuriau
de Bellevue     proves nothing,      if  not that there are subterra
nean galleries which extend 40 leagues from the sea, and that
in this instance its waters have penetrated that length.           If
all the circumstances accompanying this fact were well       known,
                                                                    it

                crystallized      Bodies contained in Lava.               4?
it  is very probable that an explanation would be derived from
them more explicit still.              In J53S an eruption equally sud
den raised the Monte Nnovo near Naples.
     " All   those who have seen volcanoes           in activity,"  says Af .
Fleuriau de Bellevue,           "  relate that nothing can equal the vio
lence and immensity of their fires, and nevertheless some
people reduce their powers to those of our common furnaces."
     A   volcano in a state of eruption presents a spectacle so
 grand and imposing, that it seizes upon the imagination of
 the spectator, and throws him into astonishment.                 This is an
 effect of the extent of its fires, «f the noise that accompanies
 them, and of the spectacle of the currents of burning lavas.
 But when we look with the eye of a philosopher, we soon
judge, from        its effects,   that this grand furnace has not in each
 of its points an intensity of heat so great as that produced
 jn our melting furnaces. It may be easily conceived why our
 furnaces have this greater intensity of heat.               It is produced
 by the continual currents of air introduced into them, which
 by their extreme rapidity incessantly bring with them a new
 blast, the presence of which gives a greater activity to the
  fire.     This   does    not    happen to the furnaces of volcanoes
  which cannot have a communication, necessary for this great
  activity, with the atmospheric air. This is the reason why
  we    see  reduced     to the state     of glass, in  a  crucible   in our
  melting furnaces, the pyroxene schorl, which is unalterable
  in the fires of volcanoes ; and we also obtain a complete vi
  trification of the fragments of lava which we subject to the
   same experiments.
      Obsidian,       or the compact glass of volcanoes, is that part
   of their     materials    which has undergone the greatest degree
   of heat. The vitrification of obsidian is complete ; none of
   the pieces I ever saw exhibit any thing except glass, all the
   substances composing it having been reduced to a perfect
   fusion. These vitreous pieces proceed, therefore, from a
   very strong heat produced in the volcano by some parti
   cular circumstance.
       Why do not these melted obsidians,               which must cool      as
    slowly   as  the other lavas, present in their interior any crystal
                                                                         lized

   48                       Observations upon the
  lized    form,     if it is not that,   because,  all the substances
  having been melted, there can l/e nothing except glass in
  their whole mass"?
      1 may even add, that it is much more extraordinary that
  we should, from the operations of our trifling workshops,
  infer the degree of power of the (ires of volcanoes, and
  thus ascribe to them an unlimited extent; and more extra
 ordinary still, hence to conclude the origin           and   formation
  of the primordial rocks and mountains.                Let us restrict
  ourselves to the effects        produced by our own resources ;
 and     not throw      ourselves into a labyrinth of illusions, by
  concluding      from small etTccts to great ones ; for, our means
 being only artificial, they are not those which nature em
  ploys.
      " The naturalists," M. Fleuriau de Bellevue proceeds,
 "    who think that the crystals contained in lava remained
 untouched in the midst of their fluid paste, pass over in si
 lence the observation of those who, as Spallanzani and Hu
 bert relate,     have seen the lava gush out at different times us
 1I, ater gushes out of a fountain, andform a multitude of very
 Irish rivulets     ;  and lastly possess  a degree  of fluidity    suffi
 cient for introducing itself into the smallest interstices of
 the bodies it penetrates :" and he adds in a note, " M. Faujas
 Uas in his collection a piece of a palm tree from the island
 of Bourbon,        which proves that the fluidity of the lava has
been very great, since it was introduced even into the fibres
 of wood."
     An impossibility        would result from this fact,    if  it were
true, i. e. that there -might be lavas in fusion without incan
descence      ; for a body which is so combustible as a piece           of
palm tree, or any other Vegetable, would have been burnt
and consumed, or reduced into charcoal, on the first contact
of the lava. Here there is a mistake, therefore. Either the
matter which surrounds the piece of palm tree is not lava,
or the matter surrounded is not a vegetable.            I have read in
the account of a voyage            to Iceland, translated and pub
lished at Paris in 1 802, that the Danish travellers thought
they saw wood in a piece of the lava of Hecla. Count de Borch
                                                                      has
           3

                 crystallized      Bodies contained in Lava.                49
 has made       the same        mistake and       a much greater,     when he
 says,   he saw pieces         of wood   slightly   scorched in entire rocks
 of the   lava   of Etna.
    I  am in possession          of  a large   piece  of vitreous lava whioh
 I  brought from the           island of Vulcano, which may explain
 this illusion. It has great bubbles, which are much elongated
 by the flowing of the lava, and their surface is traced with
 thready fissures,         having the appearance of ligneous fibres,
 increased by the hue which the fumes have given them that
 are exhaled constantly from the substance in fusion.                  Several
 people who have seen this lava took it at first for wood.                   I
 have another vitreous piece of lava from Lipari, the matter
of which        is drawn out into threads so minute and so close
that no agatized fossil wood, the fibres of which                          are
very distinct, has more the appearance of wood than this
piece has, nor has it a vitreous lustre.                 I have another spe
cimen, vitreous also, one of the surfaces of which, having
been the outer one, is traced with a multitude of very small
threads, arranged in some places in undulations, like the
ligneous fibres round a knotty piece of wood.
    From these examples I was k-d to believe that the spe
cimen from the Island of Bourbon is entirely lava, with a
ligneous appearance upon one of its faces : because in every
such case, a vegetable, even in the state of- wood, after its
combustion, which is inevitable, can only leave a void space
in   the lava and traces          of charcoal, but     never the impression
of fibres, and far         less the fibres themselves.
    In order to lay         a foundation for his favourite opinion, M*
Fleuriau      de Bellevue hazards several reasonings, which I
shall not follow, because facts and not conjectures are want
ing. One of his arguments is the following : " The large
pieces    of lava, 'which perform           the first part   in the eruptions
of volcanoes, dart out of the                crater itself, as well as from
the sides     of    the mountain        or its base.      They come rapidly
out    of   the    fires of the volcano also, being incomparably
hotter than       the   -substances which remain at rest in the crater.
This    immense          heat    and   this    rapidity   cause   them  to be
squirted out and to* flow down like water, and cannot admit

   53                       Observations        upon    the
   of crystals being formed,               AH the crystals found among
   them are produced during the cooling of the lava."
       I must remark in the first place, that the expressions so
   often repeated, of the lava gushing and flowing out like
   water, are merely metaphorical ; for, so far from lava in any
   case flowing like water, it successively leaves all its matter
   fixed upon the ground over which               it  passes.
       M.   Fleuriau de Bellevue surely does not recollect the lava
   of Etna of 1669, which I have already quoted.
       This lava, which came out of the base of this great vol
   cano, extended over some' leagues in length, advanced into
  the sea, where it accumulated into prodigious heaps, after
  having covered its route with an enormous extent of its mat
  ter both in breadth and thickness.                  This is certainly one of
  those lavas which hold the first rank among volcanic erup
  tions.      But   I repeat that this lava,         the fragments       of which
  I have before me, is filled throughout its whole course, from
  its leaving the crater to the extremity of its destructive track*,
  with a multitude of pyroxene schorls of these whitish cry
  stalline lamina       I have described,        and with      a great number      of
  small chrysolites, and the crater whence they came has vo
  mited out myriads of these same substances. Do we see
  then any formations effected at the time of the cooling of
  the lava, when all its crystals existed in it at the time of its
  greatest fusion and incandescence, the very fire of the erup
      * There is an account published of this dreadful
                                                          eruption, made at the time
  by the earl of Winchclsea, who on his return by sea from his embassy to
  Constantinople, halted '24 hours at Catana and was an eye-witness of it. The
 lava which was then called the torrent offat had reached the sea. " By its hor
 rid devastation and rapid progress, this torrent was. called," says the ambassador,
 "   on inundation, a deluge efjlrj."     It was precipitated into the sea, with a
 horrible noise; the boiling of the water, the thick vapours and dreadful hiss
 ings, and the burning substances which continually flowed down, all contri
 buted to increase the horror of the scene.      No human means being able to ar
 rest the flames which this devastating torrent produced in its progress, it de
 stroyed the habitations of 27,000 persons. It flowed along the walls of Cata-
 na; the inhabitants saved themselves with their most valuable effects.         The
 city, however, was preserved; but its walls and bastions on the tide on which
•the lava flowed, which was the south, were buried under it. Parts of them
 are still seen through some large fissures.    The appearance of these enormous
 piles of black rocks create! the idea of chnos and desolation.
                                                                               tion

tion having vomited out by                 its crater an innumerable             multi
tude of isolated crystals?
   These naturalists were perfectly right, who remarked that
the leucites and pyroxene- schorls are crystals which do not
exist in the beds we are able to see ; and they are right also
in drawing      the conclusion             from    it,   that these         substances
would     have beenfor ever unknown to us,     the volcanic         if
eruptions, in bringing them to light, had not made us ac
quainted with them.     M. Fleuriau de Bellevue thinks that
this   asupposition.
       is
                       Nothing, however, can be more true
than the observation, and nothing     more natural than the
                                                    is
inference drawn from it.
     " We have    seen," he continues,             "that no example what
ever proves that the aqueous               solutions ever formed, or could
form, rocks similar          to primitive rocks          ;   and that fire, on the
contrary, presents us with products every day,                        which      are   not
only analogous        to them,        but even identical."
     We   see, on the contrary, that the productions                       of fire   have
only   an apparent, but no real resemblance to the primitive,
or, to speak more precisely, to the primordial rocks.  The
volcanic fires, any more than those of ,our furnaces, have
never produced, and never will produce, any thing similar,
because the primordial beds do not owe their origin to fire.
     Neither   can aqueous     solutions form any such strata; they
were formed      by   precipitations in the primordial fluid at epochs
near to the time of the origin of the globe, and every thing
shows that they are not formed at present    the water of the  ;
modern ocean does not now contain the elements necessary
for this purpose,     now entirely devoid of them.
                        it   is                      The
slime of rivers,        which         it   has been       thought        would       form
them, does not reach the bottom                   of the      sea;    the tides drive
it   back and retain      it   at the mouths              of    the   rivers, where
there are daily fresh additions               made       to the first shores             of
continents.
I    shall here repeat      remarka   have frequently made.
                                               I                                              '
These  additions are so little to be compared with the ex
tent of the seas, that they cannot produce any sensible
change in their level.         These alluvia of rivers have been often
quoted    and mistaken for monuments                 of      the retreat   of the      sea.

  38                       Observations     upon the
      By what mark       can   we distinguish       the ancient       volcanoes
  throughout the world,         except   by their form, and the nature
  of  the substances    that characterize them         ?   In truth, they are
  completely distinct from all other mountains.                      The Alps,
  Appenines,     Jura,    and  the  Pyrenees      have     no  resemblance     at
  all to volcanic mountains ; the strata and substances of the
  former having been formed in the waters, and fire having
  had nothing to do in their formation.
     It was these distinctive and        invariable characters          of vol
  canoes, and of the soil \vhich surrounds them, that suggested
  the following expressions            in my former observations.
  "  When     the valley   of Quito    and the mountains             skirting it
  are viewed by naturalists skilled in the knowledge                  of volca
  noes and volcanic substances,         they    will acknowledge that the
  state  of things    is what     1 have    mentioned !" I should have
  been far from      expressing myself in this manner, if other
  soils and other mountains were in question.                    But the great
 mountains whicjh       skirt  both   sides     of   this   celebrated    valley
 being certainly volcanoes, three of which are still burning,
 and its soil being composed of their, enormous dejections,
 I  could propose this opinion without going too far.
     The antient volcanoes, which            are observed       at the surface
 of   some continents,      are not so numerous as           M. Fleuriau      de
 Bellcvue     thinks, when he         says     that volcanoes,         whether
 burning or extinguished,           are    to    be   found      every   where
throughout the surface of the globe. This is a great exagge
 ration : a great number of them are to be seen in various
places, without doubt, but the space they occupy is not to
be compared with that where there are none.                     The   same re
mark applies to old and extinguished volcanoes; for the
burning volcanoes are in very small number. There are
only four in Europe : that of Iceland is in a very remote la
titude.
    This notion brings        to   my recollection        a   similar   one of
M.    Patrin,   which   he applies to     Italy.      It  is to be found in
his Inquiries     concerning Volcanoes upon the Principles of
pneumatic Chemistry.
                              " Italy," says M. Patrin, " is covered
with volcanoes, lava and tufo of an enormous thickness.''
Nevertheless,     it results from the real state of Italy, that the
                                                                   Appenines

                 crystallized      Bodies contained in      Lava.            S3
Appenines which traverse it from one end to the other, all
the ramifications of this chain, and all the eastern shores of
this peninsula, have nothing volcanic; that the soils of this
kind     are exclusively       upon the western coast, separated fre
quently by aquiformcd strata.
    When      the explanations upon the method in which a phy
sical terrestrial       fact, surrounded hy any veil, can happen,
are removed         from the sense which          is the most natural and
the most conformable             to that which      is dictated by a similar
phenomenon,            they may be very different from each              other,
and even completely contradictory.                  Thus it may have hap
pened     that   M.   Patrin,     being equally     of opinion that the py
roxene schorls were not pre- existent to the lava, separates
them from the matter of lava, and makes -them spring from
an aeriform fluid which has passed to a solid consistence by
the effect    of attraction.
    From      all the facts    I  have   established, it may be received
as a   final conclusion*         :—
    That    every burning volcano, antient or modern, whatever
be its height and extent, and wherever it is situated, is a
mountain belonging to a class distinct from all others : that
it  is not formed by any marine stratum ; that all the mass                  of
substances composing it are production!) of fire ; that it has
been raised from its base to its summit by the accumulation
of substances successively vomited out by                  its eruptions,   the
focus of which            is below    all the strata     we are acquainted
with.
    That    the crystallized        bodies contained in lava are foreign
to them ; that they have been formed previously by the hu
mid way, in strata which the volcanic fires have brought
into fusion, leaving untouched those crystals, because the
fires were not intense enough to melt them.
    That we should cease to assert that volcanoes display
 themselves at the summits of mountains, because the whole
body of the volcanic mountains, constitutes the volcano.

observation*.

This   is shown by the new mouths           which   are so frequently
 opened in their sides and at their bases.
    That the water of the sea is absolutely necessary, from the
 salts it holds in solution, for exciting those fermentations
which produce volcanoes.
    That all the substances      and the strata which compose the
 calcareous,    schistous   and  granitic mountains, and all their
varieties ; the sandy *gypsose and argillaceous mounts are
the work of water, and fire has never approached them.
    That all the old volcanoes, which are in the middle of the
earth, have burned under the water of the sea.              The schists
 and granites,    which    are seen around some      of them, are fo
reign to them     ; they are strata through which their eruptions
have forced a     passnge, and which remain exposed to view.
    They would     have been buried under volcanic matters never
to' appear again,     if these  volcanoes had been longer in acti
vity.    Those    which were burning at the moment when the
sea retired from above our continent,          ceased to burn at that
period ; — an epoch now beyond           the memory of the inhabi
tants of any country, because none existed upon the soil sur
rounding these volcaeoes, which was then below the sea.
    Among the numerous facts which prove this truth, count
Marzari of Vicenza furnished me with a very remarkable one
upon his return from a journey he made in Auvergne.                  At
Santourgue there was found a stratification of volcanic sand
of about six inches in thickness, between two calcareous
 strata.   It has therefore happened     that, after a first calcareous
deposit upon the flanks or the base of the volcano, an erup
tion has broken ou^ and extended this sand, upon which a
new calcareous deposit has been formed, — operations which
could take place in the sea only.           Count Marzari had the
goodness to give me a specimen of this sand, which is similar
to that which was thrown out from the upper mouth of
Etna in the eruption of 1 763, which I have before men
tioned.
    I shall here repeat what I have often said : That it is ne
cessary, in order to distinguish the different epochs at which
volcanoes have burned,        and  in order not   to confound them,
                                                                     to

      Experiments made by the Galvanic Society                of Paris.   55
to call antient,      such volcanoes       as   have    burned in the sea
before our continents were laid bare           ; and to call extinguish
ed,  those    only  which   from    their  situation    might be burning
still, if in the inflammable matters which fed them were not
burnt out.
   I   have    now concluded        my observations.          I have had no
other object in making these observations, than to explain
in a clearer manner the great phenomena of volcanoes, that
we may not attribute effects to them in which they have no
share, nor refuse to allow them such as they really produce.
These limits, founded upon well ascertained facts, are able of
themselves to banish the systems founded upon contrary
notions,     and to give more certain bases to geology, that
branch of knowledge so important in terrestrial physics.

    Galvanic     Society of Paris.         Communicated by M. RIF-
    FAULT *.
 JL HEGalvanir Society         had announcedithat although they were
anxious to verify the fact advanced by Pacchiani, of the for
mation of the muriatic acid in distilled water when submit
ted to the galvanic action, yet that no satisfactory result
had been hitherto obtained.            The Society, in publishing the
detail of their experiments, in the pursuit of which they ri
gorously conformed themselves to the course pointed out by
 M. Pacchiani himself, manifested an intention of repeating
 and   varying these experiments in qujite a different manner,
 before drawing any conclusion upon so important a disco
 very.     It was in these circumstances that M. Brugnatelli,
 one of the corresponding members of the Society, transmit
 ted from Pavia some observations which he had communi
 cated to the National        Institute   of Italyf, containing        an ac
 count   of his experiments upon          the same subject, which had
 completely succeeded,          but under certain modifications in the
 manner of proceeding. The Society, after having been made
 acquainted with this memoir, ascertained that in the appara-

Sfi                      Experiments         made by the
tus lie adopted, M. Brugnatelli having avoided the employ
 ment of every -ubstance foreign to the water used in the ex
 periment, and to the metallic conductors, the results which
nm:ht be expected by his process                      coulil    not any longer pre
sent any cause tor uncertainty.  The Society consequently
decided upon fallow ins; M. Brugnatelli's process, in the ex
periments they were about to make. Accordingly, on the
8th of May last, the class for physical inquiries of the So
ciety having assembled, they arranged                          their apparatus    in the
following manner.
   They filled with distilled water, proved by a solution of
nitrate of silver, a tube of glass 60 millimetres in length*
and about 7 millimetres of interior diameter. A glass syphon
of about 5 millimetres of interior diameter, each of the
branches of which            was  40 millimetres long, with a space
of     15   millimetres     between them, was also filled with the
same distilled water, and                 rested in such a manner              that one
of    its   branches entered       into the tube and ihe other into                      a
glass full of distilled water, placed near the tube at the di
stance determined by the branches of the syphon.         They
introduced into the tube a gold wire about one fourth of
 a millimetre,   or 0-y"6,            and    into the glass            a   strip of very
 thin tin foil brought as          near as possible to the branch                 of   the
 syphon,           plunged into it.
               which                 Every thing being thus
 prepared,    pile
                a  was  mounted,   composed of one hundred
 pair of square plates zinc and copper, S0 millimetres surface
 each  (about three square inches), separated by pieces of
 cloth, saturated with a strong solution of muriate of ammo
 nia.   The communication was established by the gold wire
 corresponding with the zinc pole, and by the strip of tin foil
 adjoining to the copper pole. The activity of this pile was
 soon displayed, and was kept up about 60 hours, when if
 ceased to all appearance             ;   the pile was dismounted,               without
 changing any thing in the rest                  of   the apparatus, and another
 was substituted for            it,
                            composed in the same manner,
 but with 60 pair of plates only.   The action of this second
 pile was not entirely extinguished, when we thought     right                   it
 to stop the experiment,           in     order to examine the results.                On

 ture very sensibly.       Some drops of a solution of nitrate of
 silver immediately produced a very perceptible cloud, fol
 lowed by a precipitate verv distinctly formed of muriate
 of silver, in   the water  of the syphon and       of the glass ; it did
 not act upon turnsole paper, and produced nothing with the
 solution of nitrate of silver, except a cloud scarcely percep
 tible, but without forming any precipitate.               The water of
 the glass     assumed   alone,   after  resting  some   hours, a slight
  rose-coloured hue.
      The Society thought themselves bound to               abstain from
  drawing any     conclusion   from   the  result  of  this first experi
  ment, but they felt how important it was to confirm them
  by new experiments.          A great number have been conse
  quently    since made     in the same manner, but with piles
  composed of      a more or less considerable number of pairs of
  disks,   of   a more or less energetic action, and continued for
  a longer     and shorter period.      In all   these  experiments the
   water of the tube always manifested the same clouds, and
   the same distinct precipitate of muriate of silver, with the
   solution of nitrate of silver.        In some of the experiments,
   the tincture of turnsole was not changed into red ; and in
   one only, where the activity of the pile had been kept up
   about' 100 hours, the smell of oxymuriatic acid was much
   more remarkable, also much more pungent than in the first
    experiments.     In one of these experiments, the water of the
    glass into  which  the strip of tin foil was inserted, presented
    something like an alkaline trace. And on pouring a portion
    into a tincture of turnsole, which had been reddened by the
    water of the tube, it restored the colour iff it.
       Although    the Society had constantly obtained many simi
    lar and decisive results, yet they did not think right to dis
     continue their labours. They proceeded with their experi
     ments, even adding new precautions, in order to remove the
                                                                     water

58                          Experiments made by the
water submitted to the galvanic action from the contact of
the hands, and from all influence of the surrounding atmo
sphere.      They     placed under a bell glass, the tube, the syphon
and the glass containing                   it,
                                     as the conducting wires
                                                 as   well
of gold     and the       tin foil,   in   such
                                  manner that they were pro
                                                      a
longed at the exterior by passing under the bell glass. They
arranged without touching any thing, and without the aid of
any foreign body, except glass tubes washed in distilled wa
ter, the syphon communicating with the glass tube; in short,
an experiment was never commenced until the apparatus had
been disposed with               the greatest
                                   possible precaution. They
left the apparatus, well covered with its bell glass, upon                                 a
table in    room far removed from that in which the piles
             a
were mounted     and these last were afterwards brought ready
                      ;
prepared, at the moment the communication was to be esta
blished.  The whole remained in this state near window,                         a
which  was generally open, in  place where no kind of ope
                                                 a
ration whatever was going on, and where there was no che
mical substance whatever.
  The experiments               made in this manner
                                           produced the same
results as to the colouring the tincture of turnsole red, and
as to the precipitate of muriate of silver by the solution of
nitrate of silver but the smell of oxymuriatic acid was not
                      ;
obtained, which had shown itself several times; and the
water of the glass into which the strip of tin foil entered,
gave no alkaline traces.  The water of the tube alone con
stantly appeared to have evidently changed its state, that of
the syphon and the glass remaining the same.
   On uniting all these experiments, and on considering the
results obtained from them, the Galvanic Society does not
hesitate to conclude (always supposing that all the precau
tions mentioned            in   the above experiments have been attended
to):—
     1st,   That distilled water submitted                        to the galvanic     action
evidently undergoes              a   change      of       state    in the   vessel,   where
the oxygen       is
              disengaged                by
                               the conducting wire communi
cating with the positive pole.
   2d, That water, in this new state, constantly presents the
genuine characters of the muriatic acid.
                                                                                        3d,

                      Galvanic Society      of Paris.                    59
    3d, That distilled water, submitted to the same galvanic
action in the vessels where the hydrogen is liberated by the
conducting wire, corresponding with the negative pole, is not
sensibly altered.
    4th, That water, in this case,           gives no sign     of muriatic
acid.
    5th,   (Lastly).    That distilled water submitted         to the same
galvanic action in the syphon, where no disengagement
either of hydrogen or oxygen takes place, does not seem to
have changed its state.
    Although     these  consequences seem to the Society to be
indisputable,      yet they still continue to repeat their experi
ments upon a       larger volume of water and with longer conti
nuance, in order to satisfy the requests that have been made
 iu them by several intelligent chemists.
VII.     Account    of an Experiment        made     by the Galvanic     So
     ciety of Paris, upon       the Formation        of   the Oxymuriatic
     Acid, and   the Separation    of Soda from      the  Muriate of Soda,
     by means of the Pile of Fblta.         Communicated on the 1 5th
     of Dec. 1 806, to the Galvanic Society of the French Na
     tional Institute.     By M. CHOMPRE*.
  AN    a recent   number    of   the Annales de        Chimie*, the Gal
  vanic Society published the experiments they made, in order
  to verify those of M. Brugnatelli, one of their correspon
  dents. They concluded, 1st, That if we submit to the
  action of the pile of Volta, distilled water contained in two-
  vessels communicating together by means of a syphon, the
  water which receives the gold wire proceeding from the po
  sitive pole, constantly presents characters which announce
  the presence    of muriatic acid    :  2d, That the water which re
  ceives the gold wire corresponding           with the negative pole is
  not sensibly altered.
      It  has been observed,     that when the apparatus          is covered
   with  a bell glass,   to preserve    it from    a   full communication
                          • Set the preceding article.
                                                                        With

(50                    Experiment     made by the
with    the atmosphere and         the surrounding     bodies, the mu
riatic acid is more feebly manifested : this, perhaps, autho
rises the supposition that no trace of it at all woulJ"be de
veloped    if this communication        were totally intercepted.     The
Society were anxious to obtain still         greater effects.     But the
conductors act slowly upon pure              distilled water; and in
order to attain in this way results          of some importance, it
would be necessary to protract the           experiment a very long
time.
    M.    Pacchiani,     who   first announced       the fact in ques
tion, made another trial with another view. In writing to
M. Comparing his countryman, and member of the Gal
vanic Society, he thus expresses himself: — " la the ordi
nary apparatus, instead of simple distilled water, I pour di
stilled water in which muriate of soda is dissolved.                  The
gold wire, which        enters  this tube, communicates with the
negative pole. Another gold wire, proceeding from the po
sitive, touches the water of the reservoir into which the tube
is inserted.      An abundant disengagement of hydrogen then
takes place     in  the   tube, which communicates with the ne
gative pole :     some time afterwards the neutral solution of
muriate of soda becomes           an alkaline   solution    of soda, and
no trace of muriate nor of muriatic acid is found in             it."
    The Galvanic Society has repeated this experiment, fol
lowing the same process, and upon a small quantity of a
solution of muriate of soda.          The liquor of the tube com
municating with the negative pole was in fact reduced to
a solution of pure soda, changing the tincture of violets to
green. They neglected to try the water of the vessel on the
side  of the-positive pole.
   The committee of the society          were then anxious to      try, in
one experiment upon greater volumes, the formation of
the oxymuriatic acid in pure distilled water on the side of
the positive pole, and the separation of soda in a solution of
muriate    of soda on    the side   of the negative     pole.   The fol
lowing    are the details   of this experiments
    In 400 grammes of distilled water, proved           by the nitrate of
silver, 1 00 grammes     of muriate  of soda were   dissolved, carefully
prepared    by M. Riffault, one of the members of the committee.
                                                                    Fifty

                        Galvanic Society  of Paris.               6*1
Fifty grammes of this solution        were poured into a glass tube
closed at one end, washed in distilled water, and of 10 mil
limetres of interior diameter, and 144 millimetres long ; in
a second       tube, longer by about 16 millimetres, nearly 50
grammes of pure distilled water. The first tube was placed
upon a kind of chandelier of tin, in such a manner as to be
upon a level with the second ; and both of them were fixed
with wax,       the one near the other, upon    a glass plate placed
upon     a large   porcelain one. The communication was esta.-
hlished between them by means of a syphon, the branches of
which entered 27 millimetres into the tubes. In order to pre
vent the fingers from touching the water of the apparatus, by
means of a glass rod carefully washed, they held upon one of
 the orifices of the syphon filled with water, a damper of paper,
 which    they withdrew, by means      of the same glass rod, at the
 moment when the branches of the syphon entered into the
 water of the tubes. Two gold wires, proved by M. Darcet, and
 of the diameter of about half a millimetre, had been inserted
 to a depth of about 65 millimetres, or thereabouts, into the
 two tubes, which were exactly filled.           This apparatus was
 covered by a bell glass resting 'upon the large porcelain
 plate, and the gold wires were bent so as to come out from
 below the bell glass.
     There were afterwards brought to the table upon which
 the apparatus stood, three piles, placed in communication,
 composed of zinc and copper, with interposed pieces of
  cloth saturated with     a solution of muriate of ammonia. Two
  of  these piles were    formed, each   of 30 pairs, 67 millimetres
  in diameter     ; the third consisted of 40 pairs of square plates,
  of 5* millimetres of surface. These piles had been mounted
  in a separate chamber, in order to prevent all influence of
  their atmosphere upon the liquids of the apparatu^.
     The gold wire on the side of the solution of the muriate
  of soda was placed in contact with the negative pole, and
  that of the pure distilled water with the positive pole. Hy
  drogen gas was immediately evolved in great abundance in
  the solution of muriate of soda.        The oxygen gas was ex
  tricated less briskly in- the tube containing pure water, but
   nevertheless with more promptitude and abundance than if
                                                                   the

  (52                     Experiment    made by the
 the other tube had also contained distilled water only.            This
  extrication of gas continued in a sensible manner for sixty
 hours, at which time three piles, completely similar to the
  first, were substituted in place of them. The energy of these
 new piles seemed to be extinguished in 18 hours ; but they
 revived and were manifested for 18 hours more.                 The ap
 paratus was therefore submitted to the Galvanic action during
 96 hours in all.
     The following effects were perceived in this interval. The
 surface of the solution of muriate of soda became frothy.
 A kind of whitish pellicle covered, in a great measure, the
 inner sides of the tube, and gradually trickled down to the
junction of the glass and its supporter or stalk of tin. The
 solution became slightly turbid.
      In the pure distilled water the effects were more remarka
ble.      After    some hours    of Galvanic action  the surface  of the
water assumed          a feeble shade  of greenish yellow.    This co
lour gradually       spread to the lower parts.     The gold wire in
 serted   into   it seemed    to be attacked.
     The piles     were dismounted,      and the apparatus remained
under the the bell glass eight days longer ; during this time
the pure distilled water had entirely changed its state.            The
intensity of the greenish yellow was increased. This colour
extended into the corresponding branch of the syphon, into
its bend, and even into a part of the second branch.                The
gold wire inserted in this side was so much dissolved as
to be perceptible by the naked eye ; and two days after
the action of the pile had ceased, the part of this wire that
had been inserted, being about 65 millimetres long, had to
tally disappeared.
     The   tube    containing     the solution of muriate of   soda re
mained in       the state already described    ; only  the semi-opake
pellicle of the      sides was raised into the lower part   of the cor
respondent branch of the syphon.
     In  this state the bell glass and the syphon having been
taken away, a strong smell of oxymuriatic acid was mani
fested in the bell glass, the syphon, and, above all, in the
distilled water.         Some drops     of thi- water discoloured the
tincture of turnsole.          Tried with the solution of muriate of
                                                                 silver,

                    Galvanic Society    of Paris.                   63
silver, this same water immediately yielded a very abundant
and very thick precipitate of muriate of silver.          A piece of
tin foil plunged in this liquid   assumed     the deep purple   of the
precipitate of Cassius.
    Upon decanting this liquor, we      observed    at the bottom   of
the tube    a residue   which   was at first white,    but which on
being exposed to the air speedily assumed a dark hue, and
which was muriate of silver resulting from the solution of
the alloy contained in the gold wire which was dissolved by
the muriatic acid.
   The   tube containing   the solution    of muriate of soda even
emitted a very penetrating smell of soda.             The gold wire
inserted into it was covered with a dark brown oxide, not
very adhesive. The liquor of this tube greened the tincture
of violets; with the muriate of lime it produced a milky
precipitate.    The same trials made with the simple solution
of muriate of soda neither altered the violet tincture nor
troubled the transparency of the muriate of lime.
   The decomposition of the muriate of soda had not been
complete in this experiment; the taste of this muriate was
also very perceptible.
   The last fact observed was, that the whitish pellicle, which
almost entirely covered the interior sides of the tube con
taining the solution of muriate of soda, was not extended to
the lower part fastened in the stalk of tin which served as
a support ; so that it seems      the light had      some   influence
upon this effect.
    It results from   this experiment, that with the apparatus
employed by tha Galvanic Society we may obtain at once/
easily, and without giving reason for any doubt, oxymuriatic
acid diluted in distilled   water, and that' we also obtain the
separation of the soda from the muriate of soda.
   As to the manner in which these chemical phenomena
operate, or   as to the causes which      transform distilled water
into oxymuriatic     acid, without    the   solution   of muriate of
soda retaining in its decomposition any apparent trace of the
presence of this acid, the Galvanic Society has not as yet
hazarded an opinion.        They   have    confined   themselves to
varying the experiments,      in order,  if possible,  to throw new
                                                                 light

   light upon the theory     ;  and they   will consider it their duty
   to lay their results before the public        if  they obtain any that
   are worthy     of attention.
        I repeated this experiment,     changing the poles and sub
   stituting platina     wires  in place of the gold ones.           it was
   then in the solution of muriate of soda corresponding with
   the positive pole that I obtained the muriatic acid. The di
   stilled water communicating with the negative pole greened
   the tincture of violets very strongly.             It had contracted a
   slight taste, and was a little turbid : the salted water in the
   tube on the positive side preserved        all its transparency.
        I made the same experiment with two tubes, both            of them
   filled with    a solution of muriate of soda.            In this experi
   ment,     as in the two others, it was also the positive pole that
  gave the muriatic acid, and the negative pole that mani
  fested the alkaline characters.         In this, last tube the solu
   tion was slightly turbid.       The two solutions feebly oxidated
  the plating wires. The gas liberated on the negative pole is
  always most abundant, even when this side contains pure
   water.
       These experiments were         continued     several   days, with a
  pile of 1 5 pairs only, of zinc and copper ;          this was sufficient
  in order that the effects should be manifested very strongly,
  as well bv ihc smell and taste of the liquids, as by their ac
  tion upon the vegetable tinctures.
       M. RifFault, at whose house the committee               of the Gal
  vanic Society met, repeated the experiment made by the
  committee, of which he has given the preceding account;
'
  substituting, however, the nitrate in place of the muriate of
  soda in the tube communicating           with the negative pole. He
  also soaked in a solution of nitrate      of soda the pieces of cloth
  employed in the composition of his piles. The Galvanic
  effect was very feeble in this apparatus ; it was only sensible
  at the positive pole; i. e. in the tube of distilled water. No
  bubble appeared upon the gold wire in contact with the ne
  gative pole which entered into the solution of nitrate of soda.
       The solution of muriate of soda was then substituted for
  that of nitrate of soda, but only used for the cloth of the
  piles. This change produced more effect, but still in the
                                                                  distilled

 distilled water, or on the side of     the,  positive pole, without
 any disengagement of gas having been perceived in the so
 lution of nitrate of soda, or from the negative pole.
     But the poles having been changed, so as to make the di
 stilled water communicate         with the negative pole, and the
 solution of nitrate of soda with the positive pole, the energy
 of  the pile became   instantly very sensible in the two tubes ;
 and there were soon established, towards both poles, consi
 derable currents   of bubbles,   and continuing     nearly 200 hours
 quite visible through the bell glass         which covered the ap
 paratus.
    M. Riffault has also subjected to experiment the solution
 of nitrate of soda in both tubes. He still continues these
 two experiments, and attends to them with great care.              He
hopes they will present some interesting results, with which
he   will make   the Galvanic    Society acquainted.

may be advocates for the isotonic or equal temperament            scale,

perspective,       as  well for those versed      in  this    polite art, as
for those who have made less proficiency, have been vari
ous and numerous.             Though      some have     supposed      that the
warmth of imagination and luxuriance of fancy, which im
pel the mind to the cultivation of the fine arts, are not to be
confined to mechanical modes, yet upon observation and

  pencil  : but so tedious is the operation, and great the difficulty,
 of representing objects in true perspective,          that they trust
  mostly to their eye and experience for success. The result of
  such a mode of proceeding may be determined by portraits
 drawn by the best artists, and the different judgments formed
 concerning them. It has been well observed, that there is
  no artist who will be hardy enough to say that he can deli
 neate by the eye the same object twice with exactness, and
 preserve a just and similar proportion of parts in each.           In
 one of the figures we shall find some of the parts larger than
 iu   the other;    both cannot be right: yet supposing them
 perfectly the same,     neither may be conformable to nature.
 In addition     to this,  many situations of an object occur,
 which no      eye, however habituated, can represent with ac
 curacy.
    On this account many         attempts and various instrument!
 have been made for the purpose of giving the outline of an
 object with accuracy.
    The late most ingenious Mr. Ramsden, so well known
 for his inventions and improvements in various instruments,
 considered the present subject an object worthy of his atten
tion, and invented the instrument I am about to describe,
which     is so simple and easy in its    operation, that a person
not possessed of the least knowledge of drawing, may, with
l,ess  than three minutes' instruction, be perfectly able to take
a perspective view of landscape, building, machinery, or,
in fact, an object of any description         presented   to his eye,
with the utmost correctness.
    Mr. Ramsden left this instrument without            the means   of
enabling the operator to enlarge or diminish his drawing}
an inconvenience which I have obviated, while at the same
time I have added some other trifling improvements. This in
strument is certainly superior to any hitherto constructed for.,
the same purpose; for in this the operator views the object
through a telescope, which enables him to delineate minute
objects with great exactness and ease, which are often too
far from the eye to be seen sufficiently well to be delineated
correctly.

A represents          the
                   drawing    board,  on  the outside frame of
which is fixed the pillar of the instrument, B, by a clamp a.
C is a tube (sliding in the pillar), on the top of which is
fixed, by means of a screw c, the frame D ; at the end of
this frame is a plain mirror E,. beneath which is suspended,
by a universal joint, the telescope F, of which G is the eye-
tube.       H     are sliding      tubes, capable         of being shortened or
lengthened in the same proportion as the inside speculum c,
(fig. 2) which is fixed to any place by the clamp screw E.
The pencil L, of which h is the handle, slides perfectly easy,
without shake, in the tubes H : the pencil is so contrived as                     ,
to have all the freedom of a pen when held in the hand for
use.

                  represents      a
principal part of the invention.     The rays from an object
entering the plane mirror a, are reflected into the telescope,
passing through the object-glass b, and entering the speculum
c, are reflected through the eye-glass d, to the eye at e :                /is

     Fix    the drawing board to the                table (by a clamp which is
packed in the box) so that the surface of the mirror E is
nearly parallel to the object ; then take hold of the handle h,
and hold the pencil on that part of the paper where you
would wish the centre of your drawing, or any part thereof,
to be. Then place your eye at the eye- tube G, and with
your left hand alter the inclination of the mirror E until the
small dot, described at       in fig. 2.,

part of the object that you wish to begin with, adjusting the
Jtelescope        to distinct vision          by   the   milled head P.   Then
by moving your hand (having the pencil) you pass the dot
seen in the field of the telescope over the object, the pencil
marking     at the same time on the paper.

 J. HE comet discovered by M. Rons at Marseilles deserves
to be first mentioned in the History of Astronomy for 1806;
he saw it on the        1 1th of November, in        the morning,      and   it
is the 97th we are acquainted with, according to the cata
logue given in my Astronomic, and in the different volumes
of the    Connoissances        des Terns     published since the year
 1792, in which       I  have given notices       of the come's; and it
is the sixth    which      M.   Pons found since the           llth of July
 1801.    M. Thulis,       director of the observatory, observed it
as well as the bad weather would permit him, as the months
of November and December are inimical to astronomical
pursuits even at Marseilles.            This comet was very small,
shapeless, without any          sensible  nucleus, and not visible to
the naked eye.          On the 9th of November, at I7h mean
time, it had 181° 3' right ascension and 2° of northern de
clination.
   As soon     as I  received    this intelligence I communicated it
to  M. Bouvard      and   M.   Burckhardt, who observed it at Paris;
the latter furnished us, on the day following, with the ele
ments of its orbit, and continued to observe it: on the
 18th of December,         at l6h 26' mean time,        it had   llh  12' 4l"
of rigiit ascension and 32° 57' of declination: it advanced

rapidly to the south.          It was not        again seen until the 25th
of January.
   The follosving        were   the   elements calculated on the 29th
of January: inclination,           35° 6*;    nodes, 1O* 22" 13'; peri
helion,     3' 6° 57'; passage, 2Sth of December, at 20 hours,
movement        retrograde: perihelion distance 1'OS0.                    It was
then visible in the evening, having returned at 29° of south
declination, and at 20° of right ascension ; and they were
able'to calculate its elements with more precision.
   I have     spoken in my History of Astronomy for 1805, of
the 95th comet, which was discovered on the 20th of Oc
tober by Messrs. Bouvard and Pons, and which was observed
{o the 6th    of November.         M. Macaroil, of         the Jsle   of France,
wrote upon the 1 9th of December                1 805   that he had observed
a comet on the 14th towards the feet                  of Paon.       M. Duper
toux observed        it on the 13th, 14th, and 15th.               The nucleus
        '
was   I    in diameter,     the atmosphere 45':           it  was   seen before
the stars    of   the   third magnitude       ;   it  was much more beau
tiful than when it        was observed     at Paris ; and these observa
tions,     made at a time when         it could not       be seen in Europe,
will be very useful in correcting its elements.
   M.     Burckhardt gave,        in the fourth volume          of the Meca-
nique Celeste       of M. Delaplace,       an explanation           of  the  sin
gular phenomenon of the comet of 1770, which the attrac
tion of Jupiter rendered visible that year, having been pre
viously invisible, and this attraction has rendered it invi
sible in future. The comet of 1762, according to M. Burck
hardt, only agreed at 5', but the correction of refraction
went the length of          f,   and he rectified the elements in the
following manner :

iervations,       which              with the most scrupulous
                            he has reduced
exactitude.   The errors in the calculation only extend to 5",
as well in right ascension as in declination.  The great mul
titude   of observations, and their .exactitude, inclined him       to
thinkthat the result was very probable.
  Messrs. Gauss and Bessel have calculated the comet of
December 1805, and that               of
                                    in an ellipsis, and they
                                           1772,
have found such differences that it is difficult to suppose it
to be the same comet, at least there must have been derange
ments.
  M.    Gauss has calculated that of 1805 in the parabola and
ellipsis ; and he has found that the whole ellipsis, the great
axis of which exceeds 2-82, represents the observations better
than the parabola. He thinks that there are probably plenty
of comets where observations are not sufficient to prove that
the orbits approach the parabola, and that it is necessary to
calculate for each the limits between which the orbit is con
tained..                                            ,
   On    the 21st      of May
                         report was spread that the world
                                  a
would be at an end on the 25th ; and the prediction was
ascribed to me, of the comet that was to cause this awful
event.   I received several letters informing me that different
persons were        from terror, and that some had died. A
                      ill

    he compares       it      to   a   parallelogram, the four corners         of which
    are rounded.
                                                                                  With

     With  40-foot telescope, magnifying 360 times, he saw
               a
the same.   The axis is 32°, the equator 35° ; the diameter
of the greatest curvature 60°.
     In this       he finds the effect      of gravitation upon the figure of
the planets         :      two centripetal and two centri
                        there are here
fugal powers, since he has proved the two rotations of the
planet and of the ring.
   The most distant ring turns sensibly.                        The division      be
tween the rings is obscure,                 as is the space     between them.
     The publication of                 the second volume       of Bradley's Ob
servations for 1756, and subsequent years, has been an in
teresting object to us. Those of his successor are added,
and this volume joins those                  of Mr. Maskelyne, which begin
in 1765.
     Among          the       curious    observations    of this     year    we may
reckon         that of the annual             parallax of       the stars,    which
M.Calandrelli thought he recognised in several stars. M. Pi-
azzi had given some results upon this subject, which I have
mentioned in the history of the former year.
  The parallax of the Lyre in declination is 0*875 of the ab
solute parallax   it passes, nearly enough the zenith.
                          ;                             M. Pi-
azzi has observed   it a great deal. But we are almost tempted
to draw from the observations of M. Piazzi a consequence
contrary to that which he wishes to establish ; it  that the            is,
parallax of the  stars still escapes our measurements                         :   if
                                                                                   it
was large enough to be measured, the declination would not
be    always the surest method to employ.    To conclude                               :
M. Piazzi proposes to continue his researches; and M. Ca-
landrelli, at Rome, has given two memoirs upon the parallax
of the Lyre.

          la                         The parallax     found at          is
5" with   9-foot
            a     sector. The observations agree well  enough
to encourage him to think that this parallax really exists                          ;
which     has not been hitherto believed.
     We   received            in the month      of December        some Opuscoli
astronomici, printed                  at Rome    by   Messrs.    Calandrelli      and

inoirs,   one   of which     is upon the annual parallax        of the Lyre,
which     he    finds   as   at   4-4"   ; another upon the opposition to
the planet Herschd 1805,                and a third upon the elements of
its orbit. The rest are upon the eclipse of the Sun in 1806,
observed at Rome and Padua, and calculated by M. Conti 3
upon the method   of corresponding altitudes ; and, finally, a
nonagesimal table for the latitude of Rome.
  The parallax of 4-4" would reduce the distance of the Lyre
to 1600    millions of       leagues in place    of 7000 ; but as the pa
rallax of right ascension of the             Lyre varies much more than
the parallax of declination, it is to be wished that this me
thod were employed for clearing up this curious question.
   The greatest parallax of the Lyre in right ascension is be
tween the end           of May and the
                                  end of September ; in det
clination, between        of June and the end of December;
                          the end
and as it was towards the month of August that it was most
observed passing the meridian at eight o'clock, it is possible
that the difference may have escaped the most exact obr
servers.
  The prolongation of our meridian, undertaken this year,
cannot fail to be interesting to astronomers. We therefore
think it our duty to apprise them in what state it is, and to
assure them of the certainty soon completely succeeding.
   Since the 2d of May M. de Laplace proposed to continue
the meridian to the Balearic islands. Messrs. Biot, Arrago,
and Rodriguez the Spanish philosopher,                set out   with instru
ments on the 2d of September.
  During        M.
               Arrago's absence his place is filled in the ob
servatory by M. Claude Louis Mathieu, born at Macon in
November 1784, who is well skilled in astronomical ob
servations and calculations.
  As they       were also to determine         the pendulum at 45°, on
the 26th  of July Messrs. Bouvard and Biot put in trial the
invariable pendulum of platina intended to be carried into the
different points of the meridian.    In order to deduce the
simple pendulum from              it,
                             and the variations in gravity, they
made  itoscillate before the   pendulum of      clock, the pace

of which       was perfectly well Known,          and they observed from
                                                                adistance,

dulums ; there was not a minute of uncertainty upon the

     So early as 1775 M. Turgot, then minister, wished to
send    M. Messier to Bourdeaux, in order to have the pendu
lum     at 45°.     His retiring from public life prevented the
success of this enterprise, but at present we have much
 more perfect methods.
     M. Blot writes from Barcelona on the 22d of September,
 that he was received in the handsomest manner by the heads
 of the Spanish government.         Upon the fourth of October,
 Jie writes   from    Tarragosa,  that   the grand triangle will be
 easily made between the middle of November and the end of
 February,
      Upon the 12th of October he set out for Valentia, and
 then proceeded to Cullera,          where he reckons upon one
 station ; the rains are still an obstacle ; but in the month of
 November the north winds will clear the sky.
      On the l6th of October, the small advice boat or brigan-
  tine, Le Mystique, which was to carry the astronomers
"to the island of Ivica, arrived; it goes with sails and oars,
  and is commanded by a very experienced and               very zealous
  officer, M.   de  Vacaro: it is not armed.         The   passports  of
  the English admiralty arrived. They were to embark at
  Denia, 15 leagues to the south of Valentia; from Denia to
  Ivica is only 25 leagues, and this great triangle would be
  easily made in the months of January and February.
      23d October, M. Biot embarked for Ivica; he returned
  on the 10th November. The result of this voyage was, that
   they were to choose the port of Mongon, near Denia, in
   place of Cullera, and the mountain of Camrey in the island
   of Ivica.    All  the triangles  will  be finished  in two months;
   but the latitudes will not be observed until the end of the
   year at Formenteva, a small island in the neighbourhood of
   Ivica, where a base will be measured. M. Chaix has taken
   charge of the post of Mongon, M. de Vacaro superintends
   another station.
      M. de Vandeuil of Madrid,        M. Viot     at Barcelona,   M. la
   Nusse at V4lenpe, and      M. Morand      at Denia,    took great in»

requisite assistance. Infinite pains were taken in preparing
the stations; 200 men were employed in cutting a sentry
box in the rock of Mongo; 60 men, and as many mules,
atIvica : the tents were blown down by a dreadful north
wind ; but at last, on the 7th of December, all the re
verberators and signals were placed. M. Arrago is indefa
tigable.  Thus the sciences have lost nothing by the war.
The Royal Society of London requested the French Insti
tute to set at liberty an English astronomer, who wa* a
prisoner in France; which was instantly complied with :
this is the second           time the sciences have had this privilege
granted them.
     On   the    llth   March,       1806, the council      of   state decided
upon giving captain Flinders              his liberty, and upon restoring
his galley the Cumberland.
   The sixth volume of the Memoirs of the Institute for the
class of Sciences contains the eulogy upon M. Mechain ;
a new formula to reduce distances by several  observations,
by Messrs. Mechain, Messier, Burckhardt,  and Lalande (my
nephew).   I have there given the results of the transit of
Mercury in 1802, and the consequences resulting from                         it,
in order to correct my tables. M. Coulomb has there given
" Methods for obtaining the greatest degree of magnetism,"
and M. Buache      memoir upon the discovery of America;
                        a
where   he shows   that Columbus had consulted Toscanelli,
and that the Isles Antillia, which had been thought to be
America, were the Azores, which he recognised in        chart        a

shown in my Abridgement of Navigation, that there were
several preceding events which led him to it.
   The class of Sciences has also published the first volume
of Savons Strangers, which               has been    a   long time expected  :
it   contains some observations              of M. Bouvard       ;some me

 country     almost unknown,         where   important observations
 might be made : to him only we are indebted for any know
 ledge of the marshes of Cayenne.
      The class of Sciences having resolved to publish their
 memoirs half-yearly, were only able to publish their vo
lume for the first half of 1806 on the 8th of December.
 It contains memoirs by M. Legendre upon triangles, in the
 spheroids; by M. Burckhardt upon the comets of 1762,
  1770, and 1784, and upon Harding's planet; and some ex
 periments of Messrs. Biot and Arrago upon the refractive
 power of the different gases, a very interesting object to
 astronomical refraction. The class of Sciences offers a con
  siderable prize for an account of the perturbations of Ol-
  bers's planet.
    , M. Delambre       has   observed  the equinoxes and the sol
  stices,    and    has   found    no cause   for changing     his   new
  tables.
      MJI Piazzi   has examined the question on the obliquity          of
  the ecliptic, which has been a long time in dispute. The
  winter and summer solstices of 1804 have given him 7" less
  in winter than in summer: he does not think that this can
  arise from the variations in refraction       : he was led to ascribe
  it  to the  light of the sun being more refrangible than that        of
  the stars,     whence it would follow that the refractions de
  duced almost singly from the stars would not agree with the
  sun: he thinks he is certain, from his own observations, that
  the refractions of the stars are the same night and day.            He
   thinks that from        the zenith to the winter solstice the re
   fractions can only be two seconds in error : this is not suf
   ficient to explain the differences from 7" to 8" found be
   tween the two solstices by the observations of Messrs. Pi
   azzi and those of Greenwich.           M. Delambre only finds 4"
   as well as    M. Chiminello.       M. Piazzi    thinks   that a new
   element must enter into the calculations         of refractions,   ex
   pecting further light upon the subject: he thinks that the
   ebliquity cannot be deduced except from the observations of
                                                               summer,

   summer, and he finds 23° 27' 57",4for 1800, which only
   differs by 0",3 from what M. Delambre found by his 12 sol
   stices, making      a slight increase to the refractions   of Brad
   ley, and   diminishing by one second the latitude of Paris,
   which will be 48° 5(/ 13". M. de Laplace supposes that the
   difference between winter and summer proceeds from our
   taking the interior thermometer in place of the exterior
   thermometer,      which in his opinion ought to have given the
  true measure of refraction.
      These four useful collections of observations, the Ephe-
  merides of Berlin,        of Vienna, of Milan, and the Con-
  noissance des Terns, have been continued.
      England does not afford us the same assistance        : it seems
  no observations are made any where except at Greenwich,
  and the three kingdoms all depend on Dr. Maskelyne : but
  it must     be   confessed    that the observations he publishes
  every year are worthy       of compensating for every deficiency.
      The Connoissance des Terns for 1808, which made itsap-
*pearanceon the 15th September, 1806, by the cares of M.
 Delambre, begins a new collection of these useful epheme-
 rides. The volume is thicker, the subjects it embraces more
 extensive, and the calendar has 15 months, in order to form
 a continuation to the volume for the year 15 : we there find
 all the observations made by M. Bouvard in the year 12,
  1803 and 1804, with the fine instruments belonging to the
 Imperial observatory.
     M. Delambre has given in detail the measure of the de
 gree in Sweden ; I shall here give the result, which is 572OO
 toises in place    of 57422 which the French found in 1736;
and     I shall add  a reflection which seems to be useful to ex
plain this difference. They had not at that time the means
of verifying     the parallelism of the glasses, as I did not de
scribe the proving glass until 1764, when I published the
first edition of my Astronomy.
     I have given in this volume a table of the proper move
ments for 500 stars, calculations for the eclipses for 16O5
and 1606, and conjunctions of Venus.
     M.   Delambre     has   there  given a history  of astronomy     •.

      It has long been a matter of regret to those who wish well
  to the arts in general, and to the fine arts in particular, and
  who can properly appreciate their importance, and the rank
  they ought to hold in civilized society, that means were
  not sooner adopted to diffuse a knowledge of them more
  generally in this country.         But, in truth, it was more easy
  to  see the defect  than to apply    a remedy. Artists themselves
  were either too little impressed with this truth, that inthe
  fine arts, as in every science, the public mind must be tu
  tored and instructed before it can be so captivated as to seek
  to cultivate any correct acquaintance with them ; or they
  were too diffident of their own powers to believe that any
  beneficial effect could result from their individual exertions
  in the  field of literature.     Some, indeed, who are called ar
  tists, but who are unworthy of the name, feel so little for
  the dignity of their profession, that they hesitate not to sa
 crifice to false taste for the sake of gain, and thus contribute
 all in their power to propagate ignorance and absurdity.
 With these we mean not to occupy our readers' time ; but
 to those     who feel the captivating       powers of art, and who
 are impressed with the importance of the instruction and
 information which fine productions are calculated to afford
 to the human mind, we would               humbly   suggest  that they
 have no more right        to be angry    with  the public for not re
 lishing them, than they have          to be angry with any person
 who refuses to eat when he is not hungry.            Let the appetite
 be once excited, and entreaties will then be unnecessary to
 induce the public mind to satisfy its own cravings.          To pro
 duce this appetite, abettcr mean could hardly be devised than
such a publication as the present, if the contributors will
only keep in their recollection, that, in a great measure, they
have yet to beget that taste in others which affords to them
selves such high       gratification, and that every endeavour to
diffuse knowledge requires much patience, benevolence, and
even a considerable portion of self-denial.          Their chief dif
ficulty will be to command readers, for people do not wil
lingly sit down to an entertainment composed of dishes to
                                                               which

 which they are entire strangers: they ought therefore to blend
 their instructions in matters relating to the fine arts, with sub
jects to which their readers may not be entirely strangers; and
 these, too, must be distinguished by taste ; for in vain will
 they look for disciples, except among those who have made,
 progress in other arts and sciences.
     This work, which is published in weekly numbers, of
 which sixteen 'have already appeared, is " written by men of
eminent professional abilities, on topics relative to their re

aim of the contributors to this work is so highly meritorious,
 thatiit would be worse than cruel to dwell on any little in
 accuracies in the style of a few of the papers, especially when
we can add, with truth, that there is hardly a single page in
 the whole work that does not convey both amusement and
 instruction.
     No. VII. of the work is entirely dedicated " to the me
 mory of John Opie;" a tribute grateful to every friend of
 merit,    a part of which     we  shall therefore select  as a speci
 men of the work before us.
     "  Few men have attained to eminence by a more irregular
 course of study, by stronger native endowments, or by more
 determined industry, than the great painter whose name at
 this moment inspires public regret.          The child of humble
 life,   born  in a  remote  and  secluded  part of the island, with,
 little or inferior education, such as humble and busy parents
 could bestow, he was destined to transplant to the bosom of
 the metropolis the hardy products of a sound and vigorous
 intellect,   and to add strength and lustre to civil cultivation.
     " John    Opie was born in May, 1J61, in the parish of St.
 Agnes, about seven miles from the town ofTruro. His,
 father and grandfather were reputable master carpenters in

  that neighbourhood.         His mother was descended from the
  antient and respectable* family of Tonkin, of Trevawnance,
  in Cornwall, and, amoflgst his ancestors in that line, is
  rtientioned     the author of a valuable history of Cornwall,
  xvhich was left nearly finished, and is at present in the pos
  session of lord De Dnnstanville.
      " He was very early remarkable for the strength of his
  understanding, and for the rapidity with which he acquired
  all the learning that a village school could afford him.
  When     ten years old, he was       not only able to solve many
  difficult problems of Euclid,       but was thought capable of in-
  struciing others : and such was his increasing confidence in
 his own superior powers, that he had scarcely reached his
  twelfth year, when he set up an evening school in St. Agne=,
 and taught arithmetic anil \vritinir, for the latter of which he
 •was   excellently qualified, as he wrote many various, hands
 with admirable case and accuracy ; and he reckoned among
 his pupils some who were nearly twice his own aj;e.
     "   His father was very solicitous to bring him up in his
 own business, and to this end bound him apprentice to him
 self; but the soaring mind of the boy could not submit it
 self to drudge in the employment of a common man. The
 love of drawing and painting seems to have given a very
 early bias to his inclinations ; and the manner in which it
disclosed itself cannot be considered         as uninteresting.
     "   Emulation appears      to   have first lighted up the    ready
flame.      About the tenth     year  of his age, seeing one of his
dompanions,         whose name was Mark Gates (now a captain
in    the marine service) engaged in drawing a butterfly, he
looked eagerly, in silence, at the performance : on being
asked what he was thinking of, he replied, " he was think-
ine that he could draw a butteifly,         if he  vVas to try, as well
as Mark Gates."         He accordingly    made the experiment, and
triumphed      ;  and he returned home to his father's house in
high spirits, on account of        the victory he had obtained.
    "   From     this moment the bent of his talents was deter
mined.       It  happened soon afterwards that his father, being
employed      in  the repairs of a gentleman's house in Truro,
young Opie attended him : in the parlour hung a picture of
                                                         a farm -yard ',

                      Notices respecting New Books,                   63
 a farm-yard, probably of humble execution, but of sufficient
 merit to attract his notice; and he took every opportunity
 of stealing from his father's side to contemplate the beauties
 of this performance, which, in his eye, were of the highest
 class.    His father, catching him in one of       these secret visits,
 corrected him      :  but this had little effect;  he was soon again
 at the door    of  the parlour,   where being seen by the mistress
 of the house, he was, by her interference, permitted to view
 the picture without interruption.          On his return home in
 the evening, his first care was to procure canvass and colours,
 and he immediately began to paint a resemblance of the
 farm-yard.       The next day he returned to the house, and
 again in the evening resumed his task at home.                 In this
manner, in the course of a few days, by the force of me
mory only, he transmitted to his own canvass a very tolerable
 copy   of  the picture.
    " Nearly    by the same methods he copied a picture          of se
veral   figures hunting,       which   he saw    in the window    of   a
house-painter. In his copy, however, he had, in compliance
with the costume of his neighbourhood, placed a huntress
upon a pad instead of a side-saddle; and being laughed at for
this mistake, he some time afterwards destroyed his copy.
    "The     love  of painting   had thus so thoroughly    established
its dominion over his whole mind,           that nothing could now
divert him from engaging in it as a profession : his father,
however,       still treated his attempts with great severity,
and used his utmost endeavours to check a pursuit,
which    he considered as likely to prove injurious to his son's
future prosperity:         but the aspiring views of the young
artist met with a zealous supporter in another part of his
family : his father's brother, a man of strong understand
ing,   and moreover an excellent arithmetician,          continued to
view    his   progress    with  pleasure,  and    encouraged him in
his desire of learning, by jocularly complimenting                him
with the name of the little Sir Isaac, in consideration of
the knowledge he displayed in mathematics.
    " He therefore followed his new studies with ardour, and
had already attained a competent skill in portrait painting,
and had hung his father's house with the pictures of his

 family,   and his youthful    companions, when he became ac
  cidentally known to Dr. VValcott, then residing at Truro,
  (and since so celebrated under the title of Peter Pindar,)
 who having himself some skill in painting, a sound judg
 ment, and a few tolerable pictures, was well fitted to afford
 instruction, and various advantages, to the young scholar.
     " Thus assisted and recommended, his fame found its way
 through the country ; and so rapid was his progress, that he
 now commenced professed portrait-painter, and went. to
 many of the neighbouring towns, with letters of introduc
 tion to all the considerable families resident in them.
     " One of these expeditions was to Padstow, whither he
 set forward, dressed, as usual, in a boy's plain short jacket,
 and carrying with him all proper apparatus for portrait
 painting.     Here, amongst others, he painted the whole
 household of the ancient and respectable family of Prideaux;
 even to the dogs and cats of the family.         He remained so
 Jong absent from home, that some uneasiness began to arise
 on his account; but it was dissipated by his returning dress
 ed in a handsome coat, with very long skirts, laced ruffles,
 and silk stockings.      On seeing his mother, he ran to her,
 and, taking out of his pocket twenty guineas, which he had
 earned by his pencil,     he desired her to keep them; adding,
 that, in future, he should maintain himself.
     " The first efforts of bis pencil, though void of that grace
which    can onlv     be derived from an intimate   knowledge   of
the art,   wiere  true to nature, and   in a style far superior to
any thing in general produced by country artists. He paint
ed at that time with smaller pencils, and finished more high
ly than    he afterwards did when       his hand had attained a
broader and       more   masterly execution : but several of his
early portraits would not have disgraced even the high name
he has since attained.       Towards the end of the year 1777,
when he was sixteen years of age, he brought to Penryn a
head he bad       painted of himself for the late lord Ban.man,
who was then at that place with his regiment (the Hereford
militia), and who was an early patron of Mr. Opie, em
ploying    him     to paint pictures of old men, beggars, &c. in
»ubjects    of   which kind he was principally engaged, and

     "  At length, still under     the auspices   of Dr. Walcott, he
came to London,           where his reception, and his continued
progress, are the fit objects of the hiographer.              It is the
purpose of this paper to delineate solely his character^ as a
man, a scholar, and an artist.
     "  Mr. Opje's ruling passion      was ambition,    — but ambition
tending to the use         and delight of mankind.          It impelled
him to eminence in his art, and it displayed itself in a reso
lution always decided, sometimes impetuous, to obtain
every     distinction   which    his path in life laid open to him*.
Accustomed         in childhood to prove himself superior to his
 companions,        the  desire  of competition      became    unextin-
 guishable.      Wherever       eminence appeared,        he felt and
 eagerly showed himself its rival.          He   was  forward   to claim
 the honours which         he was    still  more diligent to deserve.
 He regarded every honourable acquisition as a victory, and
 expressed with openness the delight he experienced in suc
 cess.     On the professorship of painting in         the Royal    Aca
 demy becoming vacant by           Mr. Barry's dismissal,     he offered
 himself a candidate;        and being told that he had a competi
  tor, whose learning        and talents pre-eminently-entitled       him
 .to  that office, he replied, that he abstained from further in
  terference, but that the person who had been proposed was
•the   only one in whose favour he would willingly resign his
  pretensions : consistently with his declaration, on Mr.
  Fuseli's appointment to the office        of keeper,   he renewed     his
  claim, and was elected.

Ions conceit of crowds, but to command the respect of the
great and wise.        He bent liis powers to the formation of
his own mind: he applied himself to reading: he sought
the society of the learned : ardent in his researches, boldly
investigating truth, pertinacious (though not overbearing)
in argument, while he elicited light from his opponent, and
steady to principles which he found could not be shaken by
controversy; in this manner, while an unremitting perse
verance, superior to the neglect of the multitude, maintain
ed the cunning of his hand, he became a scholar and a
painter.
    " The Life of Reynolds, published in Dr. Walcott's edition
of Pilkington's Dictionary, was the first specimen of his
literary ability.   In this he displayed a profound knowledge
of the subject, a quick and powerful perception of distinctive
character, and a mastery of language little to be expected
from a youth who was supposed to have been destitute of
learning.                            \
    "He   next published a letter in the Morning Chronicle,
 (since re-published in
                            " An Inquiry into the requisite Cul
tivation of the Arts of Design in England,") in which he
proposed a distinct plan for the formation of a National
papery, tending at once to exalt the arts of his country,
and immortalize        its glories.      To this he annexed his
name,    in consistence with     the openness    of character which
at all times distinguished     his actions.
    " His  lectures  at the Royal      Institution followed : — these
were a spirited attempt to display the depths of his profes
sional knowledge, amidst a circle assembled for entertain
ment and fashionable delight.           His lectures impressed re
spect  on   his  audience:    they  were    full of instructive ma
terials; they taught the principles of paintina, and presented
an   accumulation     of maxims founded on history           and  ob
servation.      But to    whatever praise they might vindicate a
claim, they never satisfied their author; and he declined the

,  ing   any collision   with the brilliant specimens of erudition
   and imagination      which     had immediately preceded linn in
   that place, appeared to have been unequalled in their kind.
      " In his former lectures at the Royal Institution, he was
   abrupt, crowded, and frequently unmethodical ; rather
  rushing forward himself, than leading his auditors, to the
   subject.     In  the latter lectures    he was    more regular, pro
  gressive, distinct, instructive;         and delivered a mixture of
  humorous and impassioned sentiment in a strain of clear,
  natural, and flowing eloquence.             Here he found his genius
  roused, and his whole faculties adequately excited; and he
   shone more as professor at the Academy, than as lecturer
  at the Institution, because he was more formed by nature
  and    application to address the studious and philosophic
  than the light and gay.          bie possessed no superficial graces,
  cither in his conversation or professional practice.               Every
  thing in him was manly, resolute, energetic; yielding little
  to fashion, nothing to caprice; less addressed even to fancy
  than to judgment; in no measure adapted 4o catch a care,
  less glance,      but fitted   to awaken thought,        and gratify re
  flection.
      " It  has been said by some, who most probably never ex
  changed a word with Mr. Opie, that his mind was without
  cultivation.       That this was not the case, is plain from what
  has been related.          It may not be amiss to notice, that
  Mr. Opie       read  French    wdl,    and  understood something        of
  Latin and music, all attained by his own unceasing                    ap
  plication.
      " It would be an omission         of public duty not to add, that
  to whatever degree         of respect Mr. Opic's talents finally
  raised   him,    he may     yet be brought     forward  as  another in
  stance     in   which    we    have   cause   to regret    the   want   of
  established public direction of. his art.          After the first flow
  of curiosity on his arrival in London had subsided, and
  when he could no longer be ' the wonder of the day,'
  ' the boy drawn out from a tin-mine in Cornwall,' his
  real   qualities ceased      to   attract attention;   and, what was
  worse, employment.            His   respectable   and amiable patron,

proud to share the honour, he stood alone.                But ' the
progress of morals,' says lord Kaims, ' is slow ; the pro

    "  The   effects  produced by hours of despondence on a
mind so strongly gifted, who can measure? His intellectual
strength, however, prevailed; the force of his endowments
gradually, though slowly, raised him once more to admira
tion and      to fame ; the conscious sense of acknowledged
merit    re-animated his efforts; he exerted himself with per
severance,     and rose to   tenown:    he appeared  to feel that he
had   just   reached    again the level  of his self-opinion, when
death extinguished his talents      and his ambition.

JYlAY    28.   The right honourable Sir Joseph Banks, bart.
president, in the chair. — A short paper was read on the mag
nitude and situation of Dr. Olbers's new planet called Vesta,
whose orbit, it appears, is between Mars and Venus. The
brightness and smallness of Vesia are such as to make it be
considered    a  true asteroid.
    A  paper   consisting of the description and use      of   a new
eudiometer, invented by W. H. Pepys, esq. was             al.so read.
This paper      was  accompanied with a drawing of the appa
ratus, the chief novelty of which was the ingenious appro
priation of two graduated glass tubes, to the ends of which
are attached elastic gum bags, with other vessels, to convey
the air' under consideration into these graduated tubes.         The
importance     of  eudiometrical    experiments  to pneumatic    che
mistry is sufficiently known ; and the advantage of an ap
paratus    more accurate and manageable than that invented
by Dr. Priestley and improved by Guyton, and also more
generally applicable than, that of Davy, must be very con
siderable.     The   great    accuracy, however, and minute di
stinctions which      the author (to whom the science of tudio-
jnetry owes much) has here proposed in the different me
thods of investigating the nature of the gases, would not be
intelligible in the narrow limits of this report.
    June 4. The President in the chair. —Dr. Herschel com
municated his observations on the new planet Vesta, which
 differ little from    those previously reported from the astro
 nomer royal.       This paper was accompanied by some curious
 details on the comet which appeared in the latter end of
January and first of February last. This reappearance took
 place as the doctor had predicted from his observations, and
 has tended to convince him of the accuracy or his preceding
 calculation.     Out of   16  comets with which he is acquainted,
 only two     appear    to possess a solid body or disk, and the
 oilier 14 seem composed only of luminous and perhaps in

     June   1 1.  The president in the chair. —An interesting
  paper on the quantity of oxygen in carbonic acid, by Messrs.
  Pepys and Allen, occupied the attention of the society. These
  expert analysts preferred the use of charcoal to that of dia
  mond for this purpose, as they conceived that very material
  errors existed in Guyton's experiments on this subject. They
  began with preparing charcoal from the different species of
  wood, by burning it in a platina tube, and, as usual, the
  woods yielded more or less charcoal according to their par
 ticular qualities and densities.        This charcoal, when taken
 from the platina tubes and exposed to the atmosphere, ab
  sorbed water in quantities varying from 5 to 18 percent.,
 according to the nature of the wood from which it was
 made.      The  water   of absorption     was afterwards dispelled in
 vapour, without being decomposed, or giving out oxygen or
 hydrogen to the carbon.           Carbonic acid was then prepared
 from    this charcoal,     which yielded to the acid, in different
 specimens, from       27-60 to 28 66 per cent, of carbon, the
 oxygen varying in the same proportions.               Diamond was
 next examined, and it yielded 28'82 per cent! carbon, with
 an equal proportion      of oxygen in the formation of carbonic
 acid.    Hence it was concluded, that although the results of
 these  experiment differ      a little from the quantity  of carbon   .
 supposed    to be contained in carbonic acid, according to       Mr.
Tennant's experiments,        yet it was evident that the diamond
cannot     be peculiarly an oxide of carbon, as has been al
leged, since the oxygen consumed in the conversion of the
carbon to acid was uniformly in proportion to the quantity
of carbon employed.           In   the   course  of the experiments
with   the diamond, the authors Conceive that no hydrogen
was present, neither was there with the plumbago and dead
coal, and the water absorbed by charcoal exposed to the
air, was evaporated on exposure to a sufficient degree of
temperature.      To    the  accuracy of Guyton's' experiments

    June   1 8. The president in the chair. — A small quantity
of the waters of the Dead Sea and the River Jordan, in
Syria, which are known to he so noxious to animal life,
having been brought to Sir J. Banks, Dr. Marcet procured
about   a pint, which he analysed, and laid the results before
the society.      From the smallness of the quantity (and the
change the water must have experienced in the carriage) it
was acknowledged that little confidence could be placed in
such experiments.         It appeared that these waters contain
muriate of lime and magnesia in a very unusual quantity,
besides sulphats, and other substances        which could not be
very accurately ascertained.         The analysis adds nothing to
our knowledge respecting          the formation   of asphaltum or
 bitumen in these waters.

     On the llth, the right honourable the earl       of Leicester,
 president, pronounced       a feeling and well-merited  eulogy on
 the very acute and profound talents of the late right reverend
 Dr. Douglas, bishop of Salisbury, many years a distinguish
 ed fellow and member of the council of the Society of An
 tiquaries.     His lordship dwelt particularly on the national
 services of this most worthy and learned prelate in detect
 ing falsehood, in vindicating the originality of English
  writers,    and in laying down such clear, precise, and com
  plete principles for separating historical facts, and inductive
  truth from designed fabrications or imaginary fables, as
  must in future either prevent literary fraud, or tend to detect
  it  as soon as     it may appear.      Dr. Douglas   was  a  Scots
  episcopalian, equally pure and rigid in his own moral ceco-
  nomy as liberal and pious in his religious or political senti
  ments.       His inquiry into the credibility of miracles, al
  though      not inaptly denominated the " Criterion," wants
   only to be -divided into chapters and sections to be a much
   more useful investigation of the " Nature and Immutability
   pf Truth," than the work which bears that name.
      Alter his lordship had expressed his sentiments of           the

   The   above society,    in pursuance of the intentions of its
founder, has announced the following question :
    " What is the reason that our school of painting at the
period of its greatest splendour, and even at the present
time, has furnished so few painters of historical subjects,
while they have constantly excelled in every thing belong
ing to the imitation of nature, and in every thing which the
narrow circle of domestic -life presents to us?             What are
the best means for forming good historical painters in this
country?"
   The prize    offered is 400 florins for the best answer to this
question;   — it  must be transmitted     before the    1st of April,
 1808. The       memoirs     may be' written in Latin, French,
English, or German :        they must be addressed to the House
of Teylcr's foundation,       at Harlem.

letter from a literary gentleman,                          at present        in Paris,     to hia
friend in London.
                                                                     "   Paris, 2d March 1807.
  " During      my residence in this metropolis I heard a great
deal   of   a new method of mnemonique,    or of a method to
assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Feinaigle.
Notwithstanding the simplicity with which he announced
his lectures in the papers, I could not determine myself to
become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or
mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having
thrown away my cash in such a foolish manner.      Perhaps I
should hesitate to this moment about the utility of this new
invented method to assist our natural memory, had I not
had the pleasure              of dining       at his excellency's the                   Count of
Metternich,          the Austrian ambassador, who followed,                              with all
his secretaries, the whole course of lectures: they all spoke
very advantageously of                      it,
                              likewise several other persons
of the first rank     met there
                              I    in consequence of this
                                                      :                                          I
was inserted into the list of pupils, and     follow, at this              I
moment,   the lectures.   All  can   tell you about
                                                  I this me
thod   is   :   it   is   a   very simple         one, and               easy to     be learned,
adapted to all ages and sexes                     :   all difficulties         in   such sciences
as require an extraordinary good memory, for instance, the
names and epochs in history, are at once overcome and
obviated.            There     is   not one branch of science to which this
method cannot be applied.           easy to be perceived that
                                                      It   is
such an invention cannot pass without some critique, and
even sarcasms, in the public prints: some of them were very
injurious, and plausible enough to mislead the public, who,
knowingnothing of the method, are always more ready to con
demn than to assist.                 Mr. Feinaigle, to answer                     all these critics
at once,         adoptedmethod not less public for Paris than
                                a,

gave, the  22d  of  last month,      public  exhibitionato about
2000 spectators, in which he _ did not appear at all, only
about 1t or    of his pupils each of them made such an ap
                     15                      :
plication of the method as his situation in life required. The
principal parts were the following: history about names and
years;          geography,           with     respect           to       longitude,      latitude,.

 number of inhabitants, square miles, &c. &c. ; grammar
 in various languages, about different editions of the same
 work ; pandects, their division, and title of each book, title,
 &c.; different systems of botany, poetry, arithmetic, &c.
 &c. At last one desired the company to give him one
thousand words, without                    any   connection   whatsoever, and
without numeric order              ;    for instance, the word astronomer,
for No. 62;              wood,     for   No. 188;        lovely, for No. 370;
dynasty, for No. 23 ; David, for                         No. 90, &c. &c. till
all the numbers were filled; and he repeated the whole (not
withstanding he heard these words, without order, and but
once,) in the numerical order ; or he told you what w'ord was
given against any one number, or what number any one
word bore.          It   is still more     striking, but certainly, likewise,
more difficult, to retain as many numbers however great they
may be. For   words  and  numbers I could venture myself, with
the greatest safety, as far as one hundred of each ; and I am
sure, after having fixed them once, which is done in less
than ten minutes', I could repeat them to you at any period,
without ever thinking any more of them.

  Abridged          by   M. Gctton*.
ll*   the first section             of M. Heidrrian's work                    we'   find the
history of Galvanic electricity, relatively to the discovery of
the pile of Volta. The atithor includes under this head the
observations  of Galvani upon animal electricity ; the expe
riments of Valli ; the memoirs of Volta against the parti
sans of the systemV of a particular animal electricity;  the
dissertations of Fontana and of professor Reil ; Du Creve's
essay upon the            irritability excited in a vacuum;                     the inqui
ries of Richard            Fowler; of Pfaff, Humboldt,                        and        Rittef;
and, finally; he alludes to the experiments which led Volta
to the discovery of the electrical pile, to which M. Heidman
gives the name of Galvanic battery.
  The      second section contains the description                           of this      appa

   He relates two experiments which he made with the view
bf determining the influence of humid bodies in the Galvanic
chain.   The first consists in placing in contact two homo
geneous  metals .(pure tin) with the nerves and muscles of                                    a
frog, and in establishing the communication of the two

either in closing or opening the chain, which is contrary to
the opinion of Voha: there is here wanting, he says, the
essential   condition,    being the humid,      between   the two he
terogeneous metals.
   In the second experiment          he plunges the metallic plate
into vessels where he has put salt water, and the electricity
is augmented when we increase the quantity of the liquid
in the vessels so a? to make it touch a greater surface of the
metals.     He calls to mind the similar experiments of Messrs.
Desormes and Van Marum, who have also concluded that
the  size    of the humid      surfaces   contributes   much     to  the
strength    of the pile.
   M. Heidman         afterwards    endeavours to      determine     the
power of the different fluid conductors, according to the
degree of their chemical action.
   For example, having placed two prepared frogs, in such
a  manner that their nerves         were   inserted in watch-glasses
in which different liquids       had been placed, such as a solu
tion of alkaline stilphuret on one side, and water on tike
other side ; the communication of the two fluids being esta
blished by a metallic wire, he observed that, at the moment
ef the formation of the chain, it was the muscle on the side
of the first of   these   liquors which was contracted, and that
from the moment of the rupture of the chain it was the
muscle on the side        of the water alone which         suffered, the
contraction.
   In order that    he might not be led into error by the stimu
lant action peculiar to some liquors, and particularly to the
acids, he took care to interpose, between the nerve and the
liquor, a piece of flesh well soaked in water.
   In this manner       he submitted     to experiment      all the dif
ferent    liquids already     known     as   conductors   of ordinary
electricity, and he has         arranged them in the following

   From his comparative experiments upon these liquids,
he draws the following conclusion :
   The oxidating liquid first in the order          has the greatest
chemical power, and determines the oxygen pole with the
most     of the solid conductors. The liquid of an inferior
rank   is therefore a simple conductor only, which in the ap
paratus for, the decomposition of water indicates the hydro
gen pole.        The oxidating or irritating liquid, and the liquid
conductor,       must   therefore be distinguished from each other.
He observes, nevertheless, that the order he has assigned to
these   liquids is not constant, unless we employ them         at an
equal degree      of concentration.
   The author afterwards examines the action which these
liquids exerciue upon the various solid conductors which he
                                                           ,

                    founded
regards as depending upon chemical affinity, and which is
manifested by the displacing of the poles in the same man
ner as with zinc : for instance, the acids go before the sul-
phurets and decide the oxygen pole (in the same way as with
lead, tin, &c.); while with gold and platina the alkaline and
earthy sulphurets assume the advantage even over the acids,
and leave to these last the hydrogen pole only.
    In treating of the Galvanic chain,       M. Heidman     has made
two distinct classes.
    He  represents   the former by this series : metal more ox*
idizable  — water —metal      less oxidizable ; then the body com
municating by immediate or intermediate contact with the
two solid conductors.        In this chain the oxygen pole is al
ways according to the direction in which the two solid hete
rogeneous bodies touch the water.
    He represents the Galvanic chain        of the  second   class by
this other series   :   liquid which should oxidate — solid opi-
dizable conductor— liquid simply a conductor : then follows
the communication of the two heterogeneous liquids.
    Thus in a chain formed of silver-~wa.ter —xinc — silver-
water —zinc, the first plate of silver and the last of zinc arc
 (as he says) superfluous conductors ; they cannot be consi
dered as an essential     part of the battery, since by these two
plates we only complete the chain; and the two chains of
six members are chauged into a battery of two.                Conse
quently, when we form the pile with plates of copper and
zinc soldered, we should terminate it at the two extremities
by simple plates, in order to suppress superfluous conductors,
considering that it is not the placing of the copper or 'zinc
at one   of  these extremities which decides      the hydrogen and
the oxygen pole,       but  only  the  respective disposition  of the
two heterogeneous metals, and their contact with water.
Whence he concludes, that the plates by which we terminate
the pile are superfluous members of the battery, contrary
to the opinion of Voha, Carlisle, Nicholson, Reinhold, and
all those who admit that the Galvanic action is produced
only by the contact of two heterogeneous conductors, liquid
•r solid.
    We find in the third section a detail of the phenomena

J02                Theory     of Galvanic Electricity,
j resented spontaneously, and without any foreign assistance,
by  the  battery of Volta, when it is in full activity: the au
thor reckons seven principal ones.
 '
   1 . The peculiar smell it yields after some time, differing
a little according to the nature           of the conductors, which          are
generally metallic.
   2. The slight noise or crackling produced by a strong bat
tery, whether in the pile, or in the dish apparatus, and which
proceeds from the hydrogen gas liberated sometimes even
with  a sort of white froth.
   3. The changes undergone by the humid conductors in
both of these kinds of apparatus, such as the decomposition
of water, the saline efflorescences, the presence of a free al
kali when neutral   salts are employed, &c. &c. : the author
regards  the more  minute  examination of these changes as a
vast field for new experiments.
   4. The oxidation of the metals.     He here embraces the'
opinion of those who regard it as essential to Galvanic ac
tion. It takes place, he says, when the chain is formed,
not only in the atmospheric air, in the nitrous and oxygen
gases,   oxide    of azote, in           but also (although
                                      the acid gases,
more feebly) in the vacuum of the air pump, and in the
gases which contain no oxygen, such as hydrogen and
azotic gases. He finds in these circumstances what princi
pally constitutes the difference of the battery of Volta from
the common electrical machine, in which there is no elec
tricity produced without         the presence          of oxygen*.      In   the
Galvanic        oxygen is furnished by the water, by the
             battery
liquors which contain    and    it,
                                 the acids  by
                                            its action so                 is
much the more powerful, as this principle  the more abun    is ;
dant.
   5. The absorption          of oxygen.         One   of the most remarka
ble experiments   that in which professor Schaub observed
                         is
the decomposition of common air under the bell glass   the               ;
cessationof action when the oxygen   exhausted         is          :    the re
newing of the action, even with commotion, after
                                            a                          we have
 *   The author refers, for the development of some of these propositions,
to the work he had previously published in two volumes under the title of
Theory of Electricity.
                                                                     supplied

                      founded     on Experience.                   10J
supplied some fresh air; are phenomena which prove, ac
cording to M. Heidman, that this action requires oxygen,
and should be ascribed       to a chemical operation.        • ,"
   6. The immediate action of the battery of Volta upon
Bennet's electrometer.           When we bring this instrument
near   the  hydrogen pole, the divergency of the gold leaves
is stronger than when we bring it ntar the oxygen pole.
Immediate     contact i* not necessary; it is sufficient when
the base   of  the electrometer commumcates with the earth,
to establish a conductor in order to produce a divergency }
certainly more feeble.        It was not possible for the author to
ascertain two opposite states of electricity of the hydrogen
and oxygen poles.          He employed with this view a very
strong battery of Volta, and An eliTctrometcr made of a very
narrow aod very sensible glass cylinder: establishing, by
means of a conductor,          the communication      of the hydro
gen pole    with   the   top  of  the  instrument,   the divergency
nearly carried the gold leaves tn the sides ; and they re
mained in the same situation when he established the com
munication with the oxygen pole, which would be impossi
ble in the case of two contrary electricities.          If we put in
communication,       by means of a good metallic conductor,
the battery of Volta with a prepared frog, which does not
communicate with the ground, there is no movement; a
proof that in every Galvanic action there must be in reality
a discharge or a partition of the Galvanic electricity, which
has not taken place in this case.
   7. The seventh article, which finishes this section, has
for its object the spark of the battery of Volta, as seen in
the_dark   by Nicholson. The author also relates the observa
tion of Pfaff, Hebebrandt, Biot, and Halle, that, indepen
dently of the closing of the chain by the two extremities of
the battery, there often appears        a  light upon the pile itself,
that is to say, upon the sides     of the metallic plates, M. Heid-
man    thinks   himself    well founded in doubting this pheno
menon, the observations of which appear to him not to have
been precise, or reconcile'able with received principles.          He
presumes    that in the dark we may close by the conductor a

part only     of the battery, from which the spark                has been
 drawn.
   We may judge from this hasty sketch that M. Herman
is perfectly master of his subject ; that the numerous facts
Which at present form the whole of our knowledge on Gal
vanic electricity are classed       in his work with method and
brevity.    The publication of his first volume makes us wish
to see his continuation         so much       the  more anxiously, as
M.   Heidtnan     does  not always      agree  with  those whose opi
nions he details, and because he supports his own observa
tions upon experiments peculiar to himself, and of which
be solicits the verification.

               Bodies by the Action       of Electricity.
M. Gautherot            has   stated   *, that in    a single Galvanic
circle of zinc, silver, and water, in an active state, the oxide
of zinc formed is attracted by the silver t; and Messrs. Hi-
singer and Berzelius detail an account of an experiment in
which solution of muriate of lime being placed in                 the posU
tive part of a syphon, electrified by wires from                  a  Voltaic
pile,  and distilled water    in  the negative part, lime appeared
in the distilled water.
   These facts rendered it probable that the saline elements
evolved in decompositions by electricity were capable of
being transferred from one electrified surface to another,
according     to their usual order of arrangement ; but to de
monstrate this clearly, new researches were wanting.
   T  connected one of the cups of sulphate of lime, mery-
tioned page 12, with a cup of agate by ashestus ; and, filling

                                                                       then)

            On some Chemical Agencies     of Electricity,        105
them with purified water, made the platina wire in the cujv
pf sulphate of lime transmit the electricity from a power of
10O: a wire in the agate cup received it.            In about four
hours a strong solution of lime was found in the agate cup,
and sulphuric acid in the cup of sulphate of lime.            £y re
versing the order, and carrying on the process for a similar
(lime,   the sulphuric   acid appeared in the agate cup, and the
 solution   of lime on the opposite side.
     Many trials   were made with other saline substances,      with
 analogous results. When the compounds of the strong mi
 neral acids with alkaline or alkaline-earthy bases were intro
 duced into one tube of glass, distilled water connected by
 amianthus being in another tube, both connected by wires
 of platina in ihe Voltaic arrangement, the      base always passed
 into   the distilled  water when it was negative, and the acid
 when it was positive.
      The metats and the metallic       oxides passed towards the
 negative surface like the alkalies, and collected round il.
 In a case in which solution of nitrate of silver was used on
  the positive side, and distilled water on the negative,       silver
  appeared on the whole of the trasmitting amianthus,           so as
  to cover it with a thin metallic film.
      The time required for these transmissions (the quantity
  and intensity of the electricity, and other circumstances, re
   maining the samt) teemed to be in gqme proportion as the
  length of the intermediate volume of water.            Thus, when
   with the power of 100, sulphate of potash was on the ne
  gative side, and distilled water on the positive side, the di
   stance between the wires being only an inch, sulphuric acid,
   in sufficient quantity to be very manifest, was found in the
   water in less than five minutes    ;  but when    the  tubes  were
   connected by an intermediate vessel of pure water, so as to
   make the circuit 8 inches, 14 hours were required to pro
   duce the same effect.
       To ascertain whether the contact of        the saline solution
    with a  metallic  surface was necessary  for  the decomposition
    and transfer, I introduced purified water into two glass
    tubes ; a vessel containing solution of muriate of potash was
    Connected with them respectively by amianthus;            and the
                                                         arrangement

   1 06        On some Chemical Agencies         of Electricity.
 Arrangement was made in such a way, that the level of both
  the portions of purified water was higher than the level of
  the saline solution.
       In this  case the    saline matter was distant from each of
  the wires at least two-thirds of an inch          ;   yet alkaline matter
  soon appeared in one tube, and acid matter in the other:
  and in     16 hours moderately strong solutions of potash and
  of muriatic acid had been formed.                   •
       In this  case   of electrical transfer or attraction          the acid
  and    alkaline matter seemed to be pcrfectlv pure, and I am
  inclined to believe that this is uniformly the case in all ex
 periments carefully made.          One of the instances in which I
 conceived acid most likely       to   be present, was in the transfer
 of magnesia from sulphate of magnesia in the positive tube
 to distilled water in the negative tube. I examined the case,
 taking care that the distilled water was never upon a lower
 level than the saline solution      :   the process     was continued for
 some hours,      till a considerable quantity of magnesia            had ap
peared.       The connecting amianthus was removed,                 and mu
riatic acid     poured into the tube : the saturated            solution did
 not precipitate solution of muriate of barytes.
      I endeavoured to ascertain the progress of the transfer, and
the course of the acid or alkaline matter in these decompo
sitions, by using solutions of litmus and turmeric, and papers
coloured      by these substances       ; and   these     trials led to the
knowledge of some singular and unexpected circumstances.
     Two tubes, one containing distilled water, the other So
lution of sulphate of potash, were each connected by ami
anthus with a small ounce measure fillid with distilled water
tinged by litmus : the saline solution was negatively elec
trified   ; and as it was natural to suppose that the sulphuric
acid in passing through the water to the positive side would
redden the litmus iu its course, some slips of moistened
paper tinged with litmus were placed above                   and below the
pieces of amianthus, directly in the circuit.                 The   progress
of    the experiment was      minutely observed       :   the first effect  of
reddening took place immediately above the positive sur
face, where J had least expected it ; the. red tint slowly dif
fused itself from the positive side to the middle              of the  vessel,
                                                                          but

bait no redness          appeared   above the amianthus,       or about it,
on the negative side         and though it had been constantly
                               ;
transmitting       sulphuric acid, it remained unaffected to the
last.
  The order of the experiment             was changed,       and the saline
solution  placed         on              solution and papers
                              the positive side
                                     ;              a
tinged with turmeric being substituted for those tinged with
litmus. The effect was precisely analogous ; the turmeric
became brown first near the negative wire, and no change
took place in the intermediate vessel near the positive wire.
   In another process the two glass tubes were filled with
solution of muriate of soda, and the intermediate vessel with
solution        of sulphate of silver;     paper tinged with         turmeric
was placed on the positive side, and paper tinged              with litmus
on the negative side : as soon as the electrical               circuit was
complete, soda began to appear in the negative tube, and
oxymuriatic acid in the positive tube; and the alternate pro
ducts were exhibited passing into the solution of sulphate of
silver, the muriatic acid occasioning a dense heavy precipi
tate, and the soda a more diffused and a lighter one; but
neither      the turmeric transmitting        the alkali,    nor the litmus
transmitting       the acid, had their tints in the slightest degree
altered.
V.  On the Passage of Acids, Alkalies, and other Substances,
  through various attracting chemical Menstrua,        means         bij
     of   Llectricity.
   As acid and alkaline substances, during the time of their
electrical transfer, passed through water containing vegetable
colours without affecting them, or apparently combining with
them,      immediately became an object of inquiry, whether
           it
they would not likewise pass through chemical menstrua
having stronger attractions for them and      ;seemed reason
                                                        it
able to suppose       that the same power which destroyed             elective
affinity in the vicinity of the metallic points, would likewise
destroy     it,
             or suspend its operation, throughout the whole
of the circuit.                               *
     An arrangement           was made   of the
                                             same vessels and appa
ratus employed        in   the experiment on the solution of muriate
                                                                            of

 of   soda and sulphate    of silver, page 107.   Solution of -sul
 phate of potash wa»       placed in contact with the negatively
 electrified point, pure water was placed in contact with the
 positively electrified point, and a weak solution of ammonia
 was made the middle link of the conducting chain ; so that
no sulphuric acid could pass to the positive point in the di
 stilled water without passing through the solution of am
monia.
    The power of ISO was used : in less than five minutes it
was found, by means of litmus paper, that acid was collect-'
 ing round the positive point ; in half an hour the result was
sufficiently distinct for accurate examination.
    The water was sour to the taste, and precipitated solution
of nitrate of barytes.        x
    Similar experiments were made with solution of lime, and
weak solutions of potash and soda, and the results were ana
logous.      With strong solutions of potash and soda a much
longer time was required for the exhibition of the acid ; but
even with the most saturated alkaline lixivium it always ap
peared in a certain period.
    Muriatic acid from muriate of soda, and nitric acid from
nitrate of potash, were transmitted through concentrated al
kaline menstrua under similar circumstances.
    When distilled water was placed in the negative part of
the circuit, and a solution of sulphuric, muriatic, or nitric
acid in the middle, and any neutral salt with a base of lime,
soda, potash, ammonia, or magnesia, in the positive part,
the alkaline matter was transmitted through the acid matter
to the negative surface, with similar circumstances to those
occurring during the passage of the acid through the alkaline
menstrua     ; and the less concentrated the solution, the greater
seemed to be the facility    of transmission.
    I  tried in this way muriate of lime with sulphuric acid,
nitrate of potash with muriatic acid, sulphate of soda with
muriatic acid, and muriate of magnesia with sulphuric acid;
I employed the power of 150; and in less than 48 hour* I
gained in all these cases decided results ; and magnesia came
over like the rest.
    Strontites and barytes passed,    like the other alkaline sub

stances, readily through muriatic and nitric acids ; dnd, vice
versa, these acids passed with facility through aqueous solu
tions of barytes and strontites : but in experiments in which
it was attempted        to pass sulphuric acid through the same
menstrua,      or to pass harytes or strontites through this acid,
the results were very different.
     When solution of sulphate of potash was in the negative
part of the circuit, distilled water in the positive part, and
saturated    solution  of barytes in   the middle, no sensible quan
tity of sulphuric acid existed in the distilled water after thirty
hours, the power of 150 being used : after four days, sul
phuric acid appeared, but the quantity was extremely mi
nute: much sulphate of          barytes   had   formed in the inter
mediate vessel; the solution of barytes was so weak as barely
to tinge litmus ; and a thick film of carbonate of barytes had
formed on the surface       of the fluid.    With solution of stron
 tites the result was very analogous, but the sulphuric acid
was sensible in three days.
     When solution of muriate of barytes was made positive
by the power of 150, concentrated sulphuric acid intermef
 diate, and distilled water negative, no barytes appeared in
 the distilled water when the experiment had been carried on'
 for 'four days; but much oxymuriatic acid had formed in the
 positive vessel, and much sulphate           of barytes   had been de
 posited in the sulphuric acid.
     Such  of   the metallic oxides as were made         subjects of ex
 periment passed through        acid  solutions   from   the positive to
 the negative side, but the effect was much longer in taking
 place than in the instances of the transition of alkaline mat
 ter.    When solution of green sulphate of iron was made
 positive, solution of muriatic acid intermediate, and water
 negative, in the usual arrangement, green oxide of iron be
 gan to appear in about ten hours upon the negative con
 necting amianthus, and in three days a considerable portion
  had   been   deposited   in the tube.      Analogous      results wew
  obtained with sulphate     of copper, nitrate of lead, and       nitro1--
 muriate of tin.
     I made several    experiments on the transition          of alkaline

  and acid nut trr through different neutrosalinc solutions, anJ
  the results were such as might well have been anticipated.
      When solution of muriate of barytes was negative, solu
 tion of sulphate of potash intermediate,           and pure water po
  sitive, the power being from 150, sulphuric acrd appeared
 in about five minutes in the distilled water ; and in two
 hours the muriatic        acid was likewise very evident.       When
  solution of sulphate of potash was positive, solution of mu
  riate of barytes intermediate, and distilled water negative,
  the barytes   appeared    in the water in   a  few minutes; the pot
  ash from the more remote part of the chain was nearly an
  hour iu accumulating, so as to be sensible.
     When     the solution of muriate of barytes was positive, the
 solution    of sulphate of potash intermediate, and distilled
 water negative, the potash, soon appeared in the distilled
 water ; a copious precipitation of sulphate of barytes formed
 in the middle vessel ; but after ten hours no barytes had
 passed into the water.
     When solution of sulphate of silver was interposed be
 tween solution of muriate of barytes on the negative side
 and pure water on the positive side, sulphuric acid alone
 passed into the distilled water ; and there was a copious pre
 cipitation in the solution of sulphate of silver. This process          •
was carried on for ten hours.
     J tried several   of these experiments     of transition upon    ve
getable and animal substances with perfect success.
     The saline matter exposed in contact with the metal, and
that existing in the vegetable or animal substances, both
underwent decomposition and transfer ; and the time of the
appearance      of  the different products at the extremities    of the
circuit    was governed by tfte degree      of their vicinity.
     Thus when     a fresh  leaf-stalk of the polyanthus, about two
inches long,       was   made    to connect    a  positively electrified
tube containing solution of nitrate of stromitcs, and a ne
gatively electrified tube containing pure water, the water
noon became green,, and gave indications of alkaline pro
perties, and free nitric acid was rapidly separated in the po
sitive tube.     After ten minutes the alkaline qiatter was exa
                                                                mined ;

mined    ;  it consisted of potash and lime, and as yet no stron-
tites had been carried into it      : for the precipitate it gave with
sulphuric acid readily dissolved in muriatic acid.                Tn half
an hour strontites, however, appeared ; and in four hours it
formed     a very   abundant ingredient of the solution.
    A  piece   of  muscular flesh of beef, of about three inches
in length     and  half an inch   in thickness,    was   treated   in the
same way as the medium          of communication between muriate
of barytes     and distilled water.     The first products were soda,
ammonia,        and  lime;  and after an hour      and a quarter, the
barytes    was vety evident.       There   was   much free oxymuri-
atic- acid in     the positively    electrified tube, but no particle
of muriatic acid        had   passed into the negative tube, either
from the muriatic solution or from the muscular fibre.
VL     Some     general   Observations on tliese Phenomena,           and
          on the Mode     of Decomposition and Transition.
    Tt will   be a general   expression of the facts that have been
detailed, relating to the changes and transitions by electri
city, in common philosophical language, to say that hydro
gen, the alkaline substances, the metals, and certain me
tallic oxides, are attracted by negatively electrified metallic
surfaces, and repelled by positively electrified metallic sur
faces ; and contrariwise, that oxygen and acid substances are
attracted by positively electrified metallic surfaces, and re
pelled by negatively electrified metallic surfaces ; and these
attractive and repulsive forces are sufficiently energetic to
destroy or suspend the usual operation of elective affinity.
    It is very natural to suppose that the repellent and attrac
 tive energies are communicated from one particle to another
 particle of the same kind, so as to establish a conduct
ing chain in the fluid      ; and that the locomotion         takes place
in consequence ; and        that this is really the case seems to be
shown by many facts. Thus, in all the instances in which
I examined       alkaline solutions through which acids had been
transmitted, I always found acid in them whenever any acid
toatter remaiiied at the original source.              In time, by the
attractive power of the positive surface, the decomposition
and    transfer undoubtedly        become complete       ;  but this does
not affect the conclusion.
                                                                       Jn

   112        On some Clamical Agencies       of Electricity.
      In  the cases  of the separation of the constituents of water,
  and of solutions     of neutral salts forming the whole of the
  chain, there may possibly be a succession of decompositions
  and recompositions throughout the fluid.          And this idea is
  strengthened by the experiments on the attempt to pass ha-
  rytes through sulphuric acid, and Muriatic acid through so
  lution of sulphate of silver, in which, as insoluble compounds
  are formed and carried out of. the sphere of the electrical
  action, the power of transfer is destroyed.         A similar con
  clusion might likewise be drawn from many other instances;
 Magnesia and the metallic oxides, as I have already men
 tioned, will pass along moist amianthus from the positive
 to the negative surface; but if a vessel of pure water be in
 terposed, they do not reach the negative vessel, but sink to
 the bottom.        These experiments I have very often made,
 and the results are perfectly conclusive ; and in the case,
 page 109, in which sulphuric acid seemed to pass in small
 quantities through very weak solutions of strontites and ba-
 rytes, I hive no doubt but that it was carried through by
 means of a thin stratum of pure water, where the solution
 had been decomposed at the surface by carbonic acid ; for
 in  an experiment      similar  to these in which the film   of car
 bonate of barytes was often removed and the fluid agitated,
 no particle of sulphuric acid appeared in the positive part of
 the chain.
     It is easy to explain,   from the general phenomena of de
 composition     and   transfer,  the mode in which oxygen and
hydrogen nre separately evolved from water. The oxygen
                                        •
of   a portion   of water  is attracted   by the positive surface, at
the same time that the other constituent part, the hydrogen,
is repelled by it ; and the opposite process takes place at the
negative surface ; and in the middle or neutral point of the
circuit,    whether there he a series     of decompositions and re-
compositions, or whether the particles from the extreme
points only are active, there must be a new combination of
the repelled matter : and the case is analogous to that of
two portions of muriate of soda separated by distilled water ;
muriatic acid is repelled from the negative side, and soda
from the positive side, and muriate of soda is composed in
         •in         i
the middle vesscl.

     These      facts    seem    fully to invalidate the conjectures of
 M.    Ritter,     and some other philosophers,            with regard to the
 elementary nature            of water,    and   perfectly to confirm         the
 great discovery         of Mr* Cavendish.
     M. Ritter conceived that             he had procured oxygen            from
 water without hydrogen, by making sulphuric acid the me
 dium of communication at the negative surface ; but in this
 case sulphur is deposited,            and the oxygen from the acid and
 the hydrogen from            the water are respectively repelled, and
 a  new combination produced.
     I have attempted some of the experiments of decomposi
 tion and transfer by means of common electricity, making
 use   of   a powerful       electrical machine of        Mr. Nairne's con
 struction,       belonging to       the Royal Institution, of which the
 cylinder is 15 inches in diameter, and two feet long.
     With the same apparatus as that employed for decompo
 sitions by the Voltaic batten,', no perceptible effect was pro
 duced by passing a strong current of electricity silently for
 four hours through solution of sulphate of potash.
    But by employing            tine platina points    of   1 -70th of an inch
 in diameter, cemented in glass                tubes in the manner con
 trived by Dr. Wollaston *, and bringing them near each
other, in vessels containing from three to four grains of the
solution,       and connected by moist asbestus,              potash appeared
in   less than two hours round the negatively electrified point,
and sulphuric          acid round the positive point.
    In    a similar       experiment sulphuric acid was transferred
through        moist asbestus into water; so that there can be no
doubt that the principle              of action  is the same       in common
and the       Voltaic electricity      f.
                                                                       VII.   On

Dr. Wollaston's important researches. By carefully avoiding sparks, I have
been able to obtain the two constituents in a separate state.    In an experiment
in which a fine platina point cemented in glass, and connected by a single wire
with the positive conductor of this machine, was plunged in distilled water in
an insulated state, and ihe electricity dissipated into the atmosphere by meant

                        produced by Electricity.
   The experiments of Mr. Bennet had shown that many
bodies brought into contact and afterwards separated, exhi
bited opposite states of electricity; but it is to the investi
gations of Volta that     clear development of the fact is ow
                               a
ing ; he has distinctly shown it in the case of .copper and
Zinc, and other metallic combinations ; and has supposed
that it also takes place with regard to metajs and fluids.
.   In   a series    of experiments          made     in   1801    * on the con
struction of electrical combinations by means                       of alternations
of single metallic plates, and different strata of fluids,                         I   ob
served that when acid and alkaline solutions were employed
as elements      of   these instruments,          the alkaline solutions al
ways received the electricity from the metal, and the acid
always transmitted it to the metal : thus, in an arrangement
of which the elements were tin, water, and solution of pot
ash, the circulation of the electricity was from the water to
the tin, and from the tin to the solution of potash ; but
in an arrangement composed of weak nitric acid, water, and
tin, the order was from the acid to the tin, and from the
tin to the water.
    These principles       seem to bear          an immediate              relation to
the general phenomena of decomposition and transference,
which have been the subject of the preceding details.
   In the simplest case of electrical action, the alkali which
receives electricity from the metal would necessarily, on
being separated from               it,
                           appear positive, whilst the acid
finder similar circumstances would be negative and these               ;
bodies having respectively, with regard to the metals, that
which      may      be called      a     positive and      a    negative     electrical
nitrogen gases: but neither of the foreign products, the nitrogen gas     the          iu
one cu:.e, and the nitrogen and oxygen gases in the othrer, formed us much as
l-30th part of the votun'.e of the gases; and there every reason to suppose
                                                           is
that they were derived from the extrication of common air, which had been

    I have  made     a  number      of experiments with the view of
 elucidating this idea, and        of extending its application ; and
 in all cases they have tended to confirm the analogy in              a re
                                                                           •
 markable manner.
    Well burned charcoal water          and nitric acid, the same sub
stance   water and       solution    of  soda,   made   respectively ele
ments of different electrical combinations, became distinctly
active when twenty alternations were put together; the po
sitive energy being exhibited on the side of the alkali, and
the negative on that of the acid.               Arrangements of plates
of zinc,     pieces    of moistened pasteboard, and moistened
quicklime,     to the    number of forty series, likewise formed
a weak electrical pile, the effect of the lime being similar to
that of an alkali, but the power was soon lost.
    I endeavoured, by means of very delicate instruments, to
ascertain the electrical states of single insulated acid and al
kaline   solutions,     after   their contact     with metals;    and for
this purpose     I employed at different times the condensing
electrometer     of Mr. Cuthbertson's construction, Mr. Ca-
vallo's multiplier, and a very sensible electrical balance, on
the principle of torsion, adopted by M. Coulomb : but the
effects were unsatisfactory ; the circumstances of evapora
tion and of chemical action,          and the adherence      of the solu
tions to the surfaces of the metals employed, in most cases
prevented any distinct result, or rendered the source of the
electricity doubtful.         I shall not enter into any details of
these processes, or attempt to draw conclusions from capri
cious and uncertain appearances,           which, as we shall imme
diately see, may be fully deduced             from   clear and    distinct
ones.

  ceedingly sensible electricities, which require for their exhi
  bition the gold leaf electrometer only with the small con
  densing plate.
     When oxalic,        succinic,    benzoic or boracic      acid,   per
 fectly dry, either in powder or crystals, were touched upon
 an extended surface with a plate of copper insulated by a
 glass handle,     the copper was found positive,         the acid nega
 tive.    In favourable weather,       and when the electrometer was
 in perfect condition,       one contact of the metal was sufficient
 to produce a- sensible charge; but seldom more than five
 or six were required.          Other metals, zinc and tin for in
 stance, were tried with the same effect.            And   the metal re
 ceived    the   positive charge, apparently to the same extent,
 whether the acid was insulated upon glass, or connected
 with the ground.
     The solid acid of phosphorus,            which had been strongly
 ignited, and most carefully excluded from the contact             of air,
rendered     the insulated plate of zinc positive by four con
 tacts  ; but   after exposure to the atmosphere for a few mi
nutes it wholly lost this power.
     When metallic      plates were made to touch dry lime, stron-
tites, or magnesia, the metal became negative; the effect
was exceedingly distinct, a single contact upon a large sur
face being sufficient to communicate a considerable charge.
For    these experiments       the  earths   were   carefully prepared ;
they were in powder, and had been kept for several days in
glass bottles before they were used : it is essential to the suc
cess of the process that they be of the temperature of the at
mosphere.        Ip some experiments which I made upon them
when cooling, after having been ignited, they appeared
strongly electrical, and rendered the conductors brought in
contact with them positive.
    I  made   several   experiments,      in a similar manner, on the
effects   of  the contact    of   potash    ami soda with the metals.
Potash in no instance afforded          a satisfactory result ; its pow
erful attraction for water presents an obstacle probably un-
surmountable to the success of any trials made in the free
atmosphere.        Soda, in the only case in which electricity
was exhibited, affected the metal in the same way as lime,

been prepared   with creat care, exposed in a platina crucible
for nearly an hour in a red heat, and suffered to cool in the
crucible inverted over mercury; when cool it v"»s immedi
ately removed, and the contact made with a plate of zinc :
the experiment was performed in the open air; the weather
was peculiarly dry,                 the   thermometer stood             at 28° Fahren
heit, and the barometer at 30'2 inches;                          six contacts gave a
charge         to the condensing electrometer in the first trial ;                       in
the      second ttn wererequired to produce a similar effect ;
and after this,  though two minutes only had elapsed, no
further result could be obtained.
        In   the dccom position             of sulphuric     acid by Voltaic elec-'
fricity       the sulphur separates on the negative                     side.      The ex
periments of various electricians prove,                        that" by the        friction
of sulphur         and metals         the sulphur becomes positive and the
meiSls negative ; the same thing I find happens from the
contact of an unexcited cake of sulphur and insulated me
tallic plates. Mr. VVilke has stated an exception to lead,
as rendering sulphur negative  by its friction. The results
that I have obtained u ith lead,                      in trials very carefully macJe,
are      the    same        as    those   with other metals*.              Sulphur,      by
being rubbed           or struck against newly-polishsd                    lead,    always
became positive.                   Mr. Wilke, perhaps, was misled by using
tarnished lead          :       sulphur, I find, rubbed against litharge, or
lead the surface                 of which    has been long exposed to air, be
comes negative              ;    and this exception        being removed, all the
facts on the subject are confirmations                        of    the general       prin-

   * As sulphur is a nonconductor, and easily excited by slight friction, or
small changes in its temperature, some caution is required in dra-ving con
clusions from the experiments in which it is employed. Sulphur, examined
immediately after having been heated, gives a positive charge to conductors,
agreeing in this respect with the alkaline substances; and a slight contact
with the dry hand is sufficient to render it negative. In general, likewise,
in experiments of contact care should be taken that the metallic plate is free
from electricity : well polished plates of copper and zinc will, \fir.d, receive
a negative charge from being laid on a table   of common mahogany.

   On              principle oxygen and hydrogen ought lo
          the general
possess, with regard to the metals respectively, the negative
and positive energy. This I have not been able to prove by
direct experiments of contact; but the idea is confirmed by
the agency of their compounds : thus I have found that so
lution of sulphuretted hydrogen in water acts in the elec
trical apparatus, composed of single plates and different
strata    of fluids, in      the same     manner    as   alkaline solutions      ;
and      that solution       of oxymuriatic
                                       is more powerful in
                                               acid
similar arrangements than solutions of muriatic acid of a
higher degree of concentration ; and in both these cases
it is impossible to conceive the combined hydrogen and
oxygen inactive.  The inference, likewise, is fully warranted
by the case of the solutions of alkaline hydrogurctted sul-
phurets, which consisting principally of alkali and sulphur
together in union            with water, exhibit the positive energy
with      regard        to the metals in a very high degree.  Iirthe
series    of experiments on Voltaic arrangements, constructed
with single                            I found the solutions of
                   plates above mentioned,
hydroguretted .sulphurets in  general  much   more active than
alkaline solutions, and particularly active with copper, silver,
and lead. And in an experiment that I made on a combina
tion of copper, iron, and hydroguretted sulphurets of pot
ash, in 1802, I found that the positive energy of the hydro
guretted sulphurets with regard to the copper was sufficient
to overpower that of the iron ; so that the electricity did not
circulate from the copper to the iron, and from the iron to
the fluid, as in common cases, but from the copper to the
hydroguretted sulphuret,              and from the       hydroguretted     sul-
phuret to the iron.
   All    these details      afford   the strongest confirmation      of       the
principle.         It   may be considered almost as a mere arrange-
metal, and forms a phosphurct; at least this happened in the two cases that I
tried with platina and copper.   From all analogy it may be inferred that tlie
electrical energy of this inflammable substance with regard to metals is the
tame as that of sulphur.    I tried some experiments of contact upon     it,
                                                                          but
without success.  Its slow combustion in the atmosphere,      it

ment of facts; and, with some extensions, it           seems capable
of being generally applied.
   Bodies possessing opposite electrical energies with regard
to one and the same body, we might fairly conclude, would
likewise possess them with regard to each other. This I
have found, by experiment, is the case with lime and oxalic
acid.    A dry piece of lime, made from a very pure compact
secondary limestone, and of such a form as to present a large
smooth surface, became positively electrical by repeated con
tacts with crystals  of oxalic acid ; and these crystals placed
upon the top of a condensing electrometer, and repeatedly
touched by the lime, which after each contact was freed from
its charge, rendered the gold leaves negatively electrical. The
tendency of the mere contacts of the acid and alkali with
the metal would be     to  produce opposite effects to those ex
hibited,   so that their mutual agency must have been very
energetic.
   It will not certainly be a remote analogy to consider tha
other acid and alkaline substances generally, and oxygen and
hydrogen     as possessing similar     electrical relations;   and in
the decompositions     and  changes     presented    by the effects  of
electricity, the different bodies naturally possessed of che
mical affinities appear incapable of combining, or of remain
ing in combination, when placed in a state of electricity
different from their natural order.       Thus,    as  we have seen,
the acids   in the positive part of the circuit separate them
selves from alkalies, oxygen from hydrogen, and so on ; and
metals on the negative side do not unite to oxygen, and
acids do not remain in union with their oxides; and in this
way the attractive and repellent agencies seem to be com
municated from the metallic surfaces throughout the whole
of  the menstruum.

     wo passages      in my letter to you of the 21st of May 180fi
 (vol. xxv. p. 45 and 46), having occasioned inquiries from
 different friends, as to what I therein meant, by the opera
 tions of gravity upon the strata, " in circumstances which
have never       yet been     contemplated among the physical in
quiries   of    mathematicians,"       f beg the indulgence of your
 readers   (if  you  shall  be pleased to favour me by the insertion
of this)   to state,   that some few months after       I  had become
acquainted with Mr. fFilliam Smith's discoveries respecting
the strata, principally from considering the worn state of
the edges of the strata in the fissures, " I was led to con
sider an extension of the principles of gravity, which now
operate in producing the tides of the ocean, to the case
of    a large satellitic body once probably revolving near to
the surface of the earth, and whose attraction heaved up
the land, at the short intervals of return in its orbit,              for
 restoring the equilibrium, quicker than the waters could
run to form a tide capable of so doing, as at present.
By these supposed tides, and the ultimate fall of the sa
tellite  occasioning them, into the mass of the earth,
it should seem that I shall be able to account for all the
changes, observable or probable, between the state of a
sphere whose surface was uniformly covered with water,
nearly quiescent, and under which its stratification had pro
ceeded with the most perfect regularity (something similar
to crystallization)       to the ruptured, abraded, and dislocated
form, in which the dry land now appears, projecting above
the nearly spheroidal figure assumed by the ocean."
    The articles Coal, Collieries, and others expected to suc
ceed them in       Dr.   Rees's New Cyclopaedia,     will, it is hoped,
tend to   a  further elucidation of this subject. I am, sir,

    The eclipse of the sun on the 6th of June was the most
remarkable phaenomenon of the year 1806, because it was
total in the United Sutes.         It was observed in three places
in America, and served          me   for calculating the solar and
lunar diameters by comparing it with the observations of
the annular eclipses, as may be seen in the Memoirs of the
Institute.    I am surprised it was not observed at Boston,
where there is an academy ; but Mr. Deferrer, an Englishman
settled at New York, went to Albany on purpose to see it.
    M. Richard, a missionary on the banks of Lake Erie,
also observed    it ;  and I conclude the difference    of meridians
to be  5h  36' ; which confirms the position given in the chart
of the United States by Abraham Bradley.
    This eclipse was observed at fifteen places in Europe ;
whence I determined the time of the conjunction at 4h 30' 6"
                                                                  (rue

an eclipse for all the countries on the globe.
    They have inserted in the Counoissance dea Terns the chart
of the eclipse of the sun on the 29th of November 1807 ;
but they have omitted the general disposition calculated for
all latitudes by M. Goudin, and that of the principal cities
by   M. Duvancel        ;  they will be placed      in the volume for
 1809,    which will be published previous to that eclipse.
    M.  Delaplacu has given in the Journal de Physique some
memoirs in which he shows that the adhesion                  of bodies,
placed upon        the    surface of  a fluid, corresponds with the
capillary attraction of which he has given the mathematical
theory, and he shows the method of calculating this adhe
sion according        to the experiments of Messrs. Haiiy and
Achard.       The principle of attraction between the molecules
of bodies decreasing with          an extreme rapidity,      which   ex
presses    the capillary phenomena,          is also the cause of the
chemical affinities ; it produces an influence of masses, the
effects of which M. Berthollet has developed in a new and
happy manner.
    M. Arrago,      seeing that the light reflected by the satellites
 gives   the   same     velocity with the aberration of the stars,'
concludes from this that the velocity does not change.
M. Arrago       found the same thing with terrestrial objects :
he made experiments with a prism applied to the mural qua
 drant, upon the light of the sun, the stars, and terrestrial
 objects ; and he found that the velocity of the light is the
 same in every circumstance.
    M. Halina,       bookseller   to the empress,      has undertaken a

        The city of Eiiang,      seven  leagues   north    from Nurem
    berg, and which belonged to the kingdom              of Prussia, has
    been   treated with the greatest possible mildness:             for this
    protection it has been indebted to its distinguished urr.ver-
    sity, which enjoys the spcci.il protection of the French ge
    nerals.
        The medal which the Instilu'e decrees every year, towards
   the equinox, for the best work upon astronomy according
   to my foundation, has been adjudged to M. Svanlierg, a
   Swedish astronomer, who has published the measure of the
   degree in Lapland, by means of which we have ascertained
   the error the causes of which are pointed out in the History
   of Astronomy for      1805.     The  medal represents     the observa
   tory, and     upon the reverse — Prcemium astrononiicum Insti-
   tuti Gallid.
       John Svanherg was born upon the           7th   of April   1771   in
  the parish of Calixe, thirteen leagues from Tornea.                   He
  had an uncle who took charge ot his education, and who
  designed him for the church ; but the first opportunity he
  had of seeing a book of mathematics, being a Life of Mac-
  laurin,    decided  his taste.    As soon   as he  left the university
 he gave himself up to the         study of astronomy, with        the as
 sistance of     M. Nordmark,       a geometrician    of great merit.
      In  1796    he was made' v;ce-secretary to the Stockholm
 Academy,       and in 1603 director of the observatory.
      The Academy of Copenhagen proposes as a prize question,
 to ascertain if there be a maximum and minimum in the
 changes, produced by the perturbations upon the orbits of
 the planets, which depends upon the nature of the orbits.
The prize is 400 francs ; the pieces will be received until
the end of 1807.
      The' Academy of Berlin has extended the time for deter
mining the prize upon the variations of obliquity for two
years longer.
      M. Delambrc has finis-hed the editing of all the observa

added at the degree between Perpigrian and Rodez, which
departs from  the progression. It is not the attraction of
mountains, bat thi- base which is the cause of it ; even the
angles upon that base were bad.
   M. Bouvard has finished the printing of his new tables
of Jupiter and Saturn. I have completed those of Mercury
and Venus,        which       are ready   for printing.   M. Delambre
has finished those        of   the first satellite with the new pertur

  M.     Firmirv Didot has furnished,                as a specimen of French
industry,      a table   of    sines        calculated to seconds, which are
carried one place further than ihose of Tavlor.                          M.   de   Prony
will publish      the prospectus,            and   M. Diilot      has added to it a
page in folio for the natural                 sines   to 22 places for the ten
thousandths.
  M. Barry,        at Manheim, announces a collection of ob

glass.
  At     the    end    of July     a    report was          circulated    that     M.   de
Zach     had quitled     the observatory of Gotha, which he had
rendered       so celebrated ; but as it was he who obtained its
construction,  astronomy will always have the advantage of
his zeal, his influence, and his labours.  His journal has
been continued : we have seen in                      it,

     Physique Mecanique, by E. G. Fischer, honorary member
  of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and professor of mathe
 matics and physics in the same city : translated from the
  German, with notes by M. Biot, member of the Imperial
  Institute  of France.
     Madame Biot, to whom we owe this translation, has ren
 dered a service to physics.         We here find the properties
 of   the movements     of solids, fluids, electricity, magnetism,
 the phaenomena       of light, the theory of achromatic glasses.
 M. Biot, who has made            some   learned   notes,  complains
 that the German       language is not sufficiently      cultivated in
 France,    and that Gelilen's dictionary has not been trans
 lated.    The excellent inquiries of Volta upon the Galvanic
 effects of electricity, the work of M. Chladny upon the vi
 brations of surfaces, was not known until eight years after
 it was published ; and the work of the same author upon
 stones which fall from the skies was not known among us
 until the meteoric stone at Aigle attracted the public atten
 tion to aerolites.      Nevertheless, the reality of the fall of
 these masses had been long before established from pre
ceding facts, and the force of the reasoning in the work            of
M. Chladny.        I  have already complained several times my
self that the German         language was not sufficiently culti
vated    in France   ; and were    it not for the Ephemerides of
Berlin    bv  M.   Bode, and     the  journal of   M.   de Zach, we
should know nothing at all of the astronomy of Germany.
Messrs. Burckhardt and Delambre make us acquainted in
the same manner as the Bibliotheque Britanniqus of Geneva
acquaints us with what is passing in England.

   Noe Andr6 was born in 1728;                  he became            a capuchin in
1   745.   In   1770 he proposed         to undertake        a   chart of Franche-
Comt6  ; but, having come to Pans by chance in 1 773,    he
was kindly received by M. Le Monnier, who lodged in the
court of the Capuchins: he made some celestial planispheres
in    1778 and 1780.            In   1781 he set out on his travels,        which
he prosecuted for six years, at the rate                 of six months        each
year.      These      travels    have    produced a most valuable col
lection of observations from the pen of M. Andre.
   M. de Lezenne, professor at Lisle, has printed an ele
mentary Gnomonique in 26 pages, which will be very useful
to bind up with          those astronomical works                in which this    ap

                                                gave in 1784        I
a more extensive and complete Gnomoniquc in the Encyclo

      The necessity of our procuring good instruments without
  the assistance    of the English, has determined government
  to place pupils with our own most intelligent        artists.
      The exhibition of our national industry, which took place
  this year under the auspices of M. Champagny, minister of
  the interior, has made known a multitude of important sub
 jects which were hitherto unknown.             M. Le Noir, one of
  our best engineers, exhibited an azimuth circle, an equa
 torial,   a repeating circle, a circle of reflection for the navy,
  a variation compass, an inclination compass : all these in
  struments made with his own hands.             He also exhibited
 an    instrument,     by  M. Rochon, for reducing distances        at
 sea;    a level of  a  new construction;    two circles for finding
 the horizontal and the vertical angles ; a micrometer for mea
 suring the distances of far removed objects; a smaller and
 more convenient graphometer than any yet used ; an armil-
 lary sphere, which gives the true time and the mean time;
 an astronomical       ring;  a new compensation pendulum made
 with glass and copper.
     M. Lerebours in optics,       and  M. Jekcr  in naval instru
 ments, also contributed to this exhibition.
     We    have   distinguished some fine pieces in clock- and
 watch-work by Messrs. Breguet, Lepaute, Jauvicr, Pons,
 Eec.: of these a detail has been given in the catalogue of the
exhibition,     and in the Moniteurs    of the CGth  of October and
 12th   of December       1806.
     I sent to Rome a circle made by      M. Bclet,   and   a  pendu
lum by M. Pons, the precision          of which was much admired
by the Italian astronomers.
     M. Zeichenbach at Munich, and Baumann at Stutgardt,
make very fine instruments.         With the repeating circles of
ihe latter one may take observations by himself alone, by
means of a lead wire placed in the inside of a hollow cylin

      The emperor having granted s.ime instruments to the                      ,
  Turin observatory, M. Charles Dominique Marie du Chayla
  has been attached to it.          He set out for Turin in September
'
   180ft,     after having for some time attended            the observatory
  of   Paris.
      The     22 foot telescope    of the observatory has been refilied
  by    M. Caroche,      but the stand       of it   is  too embarrassing,
  and      they propose making another, after having expended
  50,000 francs for the first : M. Caroche has discovered that                  ,
  it  is very difficult to place a     mirror weighing 400 pounds in
  such      a way as  not to change iis form or position when the
  telescope is pointed at different altitudes.
      The 40-foot telescope of Mr. Herschel has not yet fur
  nished the extraordinary results we expected from it.                      I
  wrote to him that        I was desirous     of coming       to England to
  visit this prodigious instrument, as soon as he wrote me
  that he had no objections : I have not yet received his an
  swer.        As Mr. Herschel is now        69 years    of age, I am afraid
  he     will not   be able  to satisfy himself,        and that he will not
  find    a  successor capable    of terminating completely         so diffi
  cult an enterprise.

    Let Z (fig. 16.) be the zenith of the observer at the station S, then the arc
 ZD will be the complement of the angle CSA of the object AC, and ZF the
complement of the angle of elevation ESB of the object EB taken at the
 point S ; but by what is shown, p. S3, the angle DZF = the angle ASB. Now
in the triangle DZF we have given by observation the three sides to find the
angle DZF, which may be had by either of the following formula:. (Cagnoli,

        By    a   little attention to the solutions                               of     these problems we

convenient   line is considered as the radius, and then the
relation subsisting between it and the rest of the lints of the
figure in terms       of this radius          is found out by means         of plane
trigonometry; after which, if the radius be made equal to
unity, all the others become merely the trigonometric lines
of our common tables. This has been the method of pro
ceeding in solving the foregoing problems; and hence the
reason why no linear dimensions are retained in the results.
Thus in solving             Problem           VIII,    the side       CD   has    been
made the radius, and all the other lines of the figure have
been found in terms of it ; but as the equation was through
out equally affected by CD, we put it equal to unity, and
the whole is immediately referred to a sphere, having its
radius equal to l.
     It will     be   found          that the next problem                    viz.
                                                                       to this,
the   IXth, contains            all the fundamental          principles of spheric
trigonometry.
    It' the earth be considered     sphere, the three angles of
                                              as a
a triangle on its surface, being reduced 10 the same distance
from the centre, will represent those of a spheric triangle,
the planes of whose three sides pass through the centre ot the
earth; therefore when the proper reductions have been ap
plied to the observed angles for this purpose by mians of
the foregoing problems, the rc-,lution of the triangle be
comes extremely easy by spheric triiionomeiry.
   As radii drawn from the centre of a sphere to the circuni-
ference, or beyond, continually, diverire or recede from each
other, therefore when a chain of triangle* are obsei ved near
 the earth's surface, it is clear they must be reduced so as to
 have all their angular points at the same distance from the
'earth's centre, when considered as a sphere ; but if the
earth's figure be taken as spheroid of revolution, these
                                          a
triangles are commonly reduced to the level of ihe sea in
the same latitude.
     The                        of
                       each triangle arc then added together;
             three anglrs
and  since this triangle is in fact spherical, therefore the
sum of the angles must necessarily surpass ISO". This ex
cess, which is also affected by (he c.rorof observation, is
to    b,e   divided   by   3,   and one-third         part   it,   to be taken from
                                                                                  each

each angle, which makes their sum, thus corrected, equal to
 180°   exactly: with       these   the   distances are computed, con
sidering the triangle merely as a plane one.
     When the sides of a spheric triangle are very small in
comparison of the radius, which is the case in most geodesic
operations, there are some convenient formulae in Legen-
 dre's Trigonometry, p. 463, for its solution.                Another way
is to take the chords of the arcs and find the angles formed
 by those chords at each of the stations, and the triangle
 then to be computed is actually a plane one.                On this sub
ject   see the   xviiith   chapter   of  Cagnoli's Trigonometry *.
     As all substances expand by heat and contract by cold,
 if the measurement of the base has been conducted under
 different temperatures, it will require reducing to that length
 which it would have been found had the temperature re
 mained uniform during the whole time of measuring.
     The most advantageous shape of a triangle for determining
 the angles is, when the triangle is equilateral. (Cagnoli,332.)
 We must therefore in practice approach as near to that as
  circumstances will admit.
     Persons unaccustomed            to   the practice would        naturally
  suppose that the small errors in a chain           of triangles    f would
  accumulate to such a degree as to render the work very un
  certain after passing through the first six or eight triangles :
  however, the contrary is known to be the fact. The small
  errors compensate each other, and the work may be depended
  upon with as much certainty after twenty triangles as after
  two. Colonel Mudge, the present able conductor of the tri
  gonometrical survey in England, from the base measured on
  Hounslow Heath, carried on a series of 24 triangles over a
  distance of 60 miles; and then, having measured a base of
  verification, and compared it with the computed triangles,
  had the satisfaction to find a difference of no more than 4-f
  inches between         them.      This remarkably near agreement,
  whilst it     proves     that  the   errors compensate        each    other,

 shows also the great care that he took in measuring the
angles, and in conducting the whole of the operations.
  It cannot be too strongly recommended to observers to
measure             all three of the angles, several times, on different
parts        or'   the arc of the instrument, and then to take a mean
of    them all.           If
                  time will permit, this should be repeated
for several successive days, at all hours of the day ; for it
has been strongly suspected that there exists a lateral as svel 1
as a        horizontal      refraction.
      It,
     sometimes happens that the sun illuminates only one-
half of an object; and the observer,     he    not on his          if         is
guard, will bisect the dark part of  the object instead of
taking its centre.               This may be avoided     waiting till the
                                                                        by
sun     is   obscured,         or causes an equal illumination on both
sides       of it; or      by  possible, such objects as are
                                choosing,        if
projected on the sky    rays drawn    by
                                    from the observer's eve;
then the object appearing dark, anJ the sky behind     being                             it
light, he cannot fail of bisecting     properly with    hide it                          a
attention.
  The height of signal       of more consequence than its
                               a             is
width in geodesic operations; for     evident, the wider it   is                                it
is,the more uncertainty there will be in bisecting it. De-
lambre took            -5-0 J-g-y    of    the    greatest    distance for the height
of his sig lals, whence its height                           appeared under an angle
of 31". Or D = the greatest distance Of signal, H= its
                      if                                                a
required height then he made H = D
                          ;          3l" = 00015 D,                ?,              0
and the base he made one-third                        of the height.
  Care sh iu'd b3 taken that the                      siJes of the triangles             are   not
chosen too long or too short in comparison of the length of
the base.    side should never subtend
                    A                    less angle than 25°       a
on any account.      When the chain of triangles        long be                    is
tween the first bass  and the base of verification, the   sides of
the triangles may bs so chosen as to increase      length gra                in
dually  till about the middle, and  then  to  decrease  in the
game manner from                     the   middle to the base                of verification.
By this means one or two triangles may be saved without
sensibly diminishing the accuracy  and the advantage will;                                           •

     Legendre has proved, in a work lately published by hirnf
entitled " Nouuelle Mcthode pour la Determination des Or-
 bites des Cnmetes," that in order to diminish              as  much    as pos
sible the influence of errors committed in measuring arcs,
or in any series of observations whatever, we*must render
the sum of the squares of these errors a minimum.                       He has
 also proved, in another work,             that   the   difference    between
 •pheric and spheroidic angles does not amount to So much
 as the ,'yth part of a second in the greatest of the French
 triangles.      The consideration of        the spheroid may therefore
 with   safety be neglected, and          the   earth    may be taken as a
 perfect sphere     ii. all such geodesic operations           as are usually
 carried on.
     The   real places   of the stations cannot be assigned by             only
 knowing their distances         ; it  it necessary,       besides,   that we
 should know the latitude and             long'tude     of one place, and
 the angle made by one of the sides of the triangle with the
 meridian of this place : we may then refer the other two
 places to the meridian and equator, or determine- their lati
  tudes and longitudes.
     In taking     a series   of triangles for any purpose, such as
 determining an arc        of the meridian, it is necessary to mea
 sure either one or two bases of verification,               in order to      as
 certain whether the results obtained from the calculation are
 correct at the end of the operations.

     AVING     undertaken     to elucidate         the Stanhope      scale   of
 musical intervals by every means in my power, I betr here
 to resume the tables, pages 195 to 19* of your la*t volume,
 for the purpose of stating          the     Stanhope interval, &c. in

and the most Minute m          f — ^,-     ), I   wish to remark, that the
interval 2    I have been long acquainted wiih, as the lesser
Diesis of Mr. Maxwell, and it it the flat temperament of the
fifths  in my equal -temperament, mentioned in your last
number, p. G5 : the interval in, is the wolf or difference
between 12 fifths tempered as there directed and 7 octaves:
the other interval     f I obtained, from a valuable set           of manu
scripts by the late Mr. Marmaduke Ouerend, organist of
Isleworth, in Middlesex, now in the possession of Dr. Call-
cott, who obligingly lent them to me for perusal, since I
had completed my equal temperament.                        The intervals m
and fare the two smallest intervals which Mr. Ovetend was
able to deduce, from an almost endless subtraction of the
ratios expressing musical intervals from each other, in all
their  forms     of combination;             their smallncss,     compared
even with    £,  seemed     to me       to render them fit to be used
therewith    in expressing musical intervals; and so I have
found    them,    in an extensive reduction of Mr. Overend's
scales  of intervals into this notation, and also in Lord Stan
hope's  intervals, shown in columns fi ami 7 of Table I, and
columns 4 and       A of Table    II.   following.

haps .towards fixing the nomenclature of this science.                             I

   [In compliance with a particular request from Dr. Callcotl and Mr. Farnl
I give a place to the following correspondence, which has already appeared
hi print.   It will be read with interest by those who are veraant in the theory
of music, which seems now very much to engross the attention of the public.

and takes so great an interest in the new Temperament of
the Piano Forte, which is now so much the subject of con
versation in the Musical World, I hope that the present
liberty will be excused.
    Earl STANHOPE has just sent me                  a Letter on his System,
which      will throw        great light     on   the mathematical, part         of
the subject,       in answer to that contained in             Mr. TIL LOCH'S
Philosophical         Magazine of April last, by Mr. JOHN FA REV.

letter press, I shall cause  it to be engraven, and given with the next or a suc
ceeding number.—      A. T.

    You     ask me my opinion       of Mr. JOHN FAREY'S           observa
tions"     OH the Stanhnpe Temperament         of the Musical Scale."
The mistakes which         he makes are so extremely obvious, that
they are scarcely worth your attention.
    In the first place, he begins by objecting to my having
divided the Scale of my Monochord, into one hundred and
twenty parts ; and he wishes to substitute a division               of one
Hundred parts.
    I  chose that number, 120, on purpose; because it is di
visible exactly into two thirds, by the number 80 ; into
three quarters, by the number go ; into four Jifths, by the
number 96 ; into eight fifteenths, by the number 64 ; and
into halves, by the number 60. So that, if the length of
the C wire be made equal to 120 equal divisions on the
Scale, the length of the E wire will be exactly 96 of those
divisions, according to my Temperament ; that of the F
wire will be exactly 90 ; that of the G wire, will be exactly
80 ; that of the B wire, will be exactly 64 ; and that of the
C wire next above, will be exactly 60.
    Whereas, Mr. FARET, by injudiciously dividing his scale
into    100 equal parts, instead     of the proper number,          which
is 120, cannot express those important lengths in round
numbers', but he is obliged to express the length of the G
tvire, by the number 60 on his Scale, followed by the de
cimal fraction 66f 66 ad infinllum.         In like manner he ex-
,preues the length        of  the B wire by   the number 53 on his
                                                                    ScaJe,

                           On the Stanhope Temperament.                                        14,5
Scale, followed 'by the decimal fraction 33333 ad Infinitum.
And this alteration he considers as an improvement !
  He misconceives (for I do not impute to him an inten
tion wilfully to misrepresent) what f have said respecting
" the value" of the C Wolf, and " the value" of the Ouint
Wolf, in my Treatise. Any person, however, who reads
my work with common attention, will clearly perceive that
those deviations from perfect intervals are concisely, as
well as accurately and conveniently, expressed by me by
hieans of the difference between                      the lengths           of certain wires
respectively.  And he will not,                      as a   man of science, venture
to assert, that those respective   lengths are not accurately
calculated, or that the difference between them is not accu
rately stated.  And it is by means of the relative and accu
rate lengths     wires, which are of the same quality and
                       of'
thickness, and which have precisely the same degree of
tension,        that  I      have,   throughout         my whole                 work,   endea
voured to explain, to an enlightened and intelligent public,
those interesting truths, which   wished to make them clearly
                                                I
understand, upon      subject which the ablest men belonging
                                 a
to the musical profession justly consider " as the very bash
and foundation     musical scL-nce." Fur, when
                            of                     man talks                      a
of   a.   Quint, or of any other musical interval, in any key
whatsoever, he must have in view some given mode of tem
perament   or else he does not conceive with clearness, nor
                ;
express himself              with precision.
     Mr. FAREY,             in noticing what     I     have said            in   my pamphlet
respecting           the     Wolves,      expresses         himself thus           :      "  His
Lordship            speaks    of Jour Wolves                 in    the      Major        Thirds,
whereas"            (says    Mr. FAUEY) '' there                  is   but one such            in
terval, which              for distinction   I       have called the Tierce               JVoIf,

be evident that               this interval,        VIII     —    3    III,      owing    to the
equality of all the octaves, whether taken above C, G, D,

146                 On the Stanhope Temperament.
   This expression of            five   columns,      does alone prove td »
demonstration,         that   Mr. Farev         does   not understand even
the first principles of my new mode of tuning instruments
with fixed tones. For, in my Treatise on that subject (in
pages 7,. 8, and 9), I express myself as follows :
   "   There are     four other wolves                in the major thirds.
But, in order to explain this part of the subject, it will be
necessary first to show that there are four series of major
thirds which are unalterably distinct from each other. Those
four series are shown, in four columns, in the following
table of successive major thirds, where the four keys
C, G, D, A,        are placed, in the lowest            line, in  the order      of
occurrence as successive quints.                The other keys are then
to be placed, as major thirds, in the regular order shown
in the TABLE.

   "    By inspecting the above simple tahle, it will clearly
appear that the following series of major thirds, viz. C, E; —
E, G sharp, which          is the same key as      A   fiat ; — and   A   flat,  C,
forms a column, in which those three successive major
thirds return in constant and regular succession, without
ever including in that series any of the nine major thirds.
So that, Nature has, as it were (if I may be allowed the
expression), imprisoned that series of three major thirds in
a column by itself.
                                                                          "    The

      "    The     series    of    the   three        major thirds,            G, B ; — B, D
Sharp, which is the same                        key       as   E   flat   ; — and E flat, G,

      "
     And, in like manner, the series of the remaining three
major thirds, A, C sharp, which is the same key as D flat ;
-— D flat, F; — and F, A, forms a fourth column.
  " In order to distinguish these four columns from each
Mher, I shall name them from the lowest key in each co
lumn respectively            ;    thus we shall have,
    "      ist, The C column,                   which          consists of        C, E, and
A     flat.

and       F.
    "Now it is a very curious fact, that each of these four
columns of major thirds has ITS OWN DISTINCT WOLF,
exclusively of the QUINT WOLF, which, as we have already
seen,      aflvcts all the twelve keys without exception.
    "     If, inC column, for example, the three successive
                    the
major thirds, C, E ; — E, G sharp, which is the same key as
A flat ; — and A fiat, C, be all made quite perfect; then CC,
which is thus produced by means of those three perfect
thirds, will not be a perfect octave, but it will be flatter
than the perfect octave                  CC      would be.

And it     was from my having observed                            these           five distinct
wolves, that I             was       led to find out *hat superior mode                                of

  Where does Mr. Farev find,                                rn what           I   have said, the
five    columns which                he has        thus inaccurately mentioned                           ?
I speak    distinctly of            four      series     of major             third's      which      are
•Unalterabby distinct               from each other.                 I    represent            them    in
four      columns.              I    expressly         mention           the          three      major
thirds which each of those                     four         columns           contains respec
tively.     I   specify         four     wolves (not' five wolves) in the
major thirds, namely,                  one in each of those four natural
and unalterable columns ; and                           I   stateexpressly and most
distinctly, that   those   "              four,          together with the quint
wolf,     make the five                   wolves            which         I    have mentioned
above."         For,      as   for the column., which has for its title, at
the top of      it,   these words,            viz.      " higher octaves of                           the
keys in the     first column;''               it   is   obvious, from bare inspec
tion, that      it   is   neither more nor less than the                              first    column
repeated   ;    and that        it   contains   all the same notes precisely,
and none other   namely,
                      ;                    the three notes, C, E, and A
flat
   ; which are the very notes which compose the                                            C   column,
or the first of the four series of major thirds.
   How can this mathematician divide                                 the twelve series                 of
major     thirds into           five      equal         series?      Or,          by    what means
will   he divide the number twelve, into                      five equal or aliquot
parts? Or how can he contrive                        to place     five distinct co
                                                                     in
lumns, the four natural and                          unalterable series of three
major thirds each; without repeating,                               in'   the         fifth column,
some one of those four series                   )

found an exactly similar wolf in each     the other three                of
columns."         That         is   to say,    in the       G   column,               in   the   D co
                                                                                                 lumn,

                   On the Stanhope Temperament.                   149
 iiimn,    and in the A  column    respectively.   This is accurate
 language.      But, because    the FOUR wolves in the major
 thirds, are SIMILAR to each other;         Mr. FAREV    seems dis
 pleased that I do not consider them as ONE.
    A   half-guinea, a halt-crown, a six-pence, and a half
 penny, bear, as moieties, the same proportion and relation,
 to the guinea, the crown, the shilling, and the penny-piece,
respectively.     Yet,  those   FOUR first mentioned coins,       al
 though similar    as halves, are not at all equal; though, ac
cording to Mr.      FAREY'S mode of reasoning, they ought all
 FOUR to be considered     as  exactly ONE and THE SAME.
    In  like manner, so little are those FOUR wolves the same,
 that they cannot exist even in the same column.                They
 never can interchange places.        Nature has (as it were) for
 bid them to meet, in the same series        ; and  they cannot be
 substituted for each other.       For, the  G wolf, for example,
 in monochord lengths, is as much smaller than the C wolf,
 as the G itself is smaller than the C.
     In my new Temperament, I moreover divide those FOUR
 wolves differently.     For, in the C and G columns, I distri
 bute them in one way ; as appears by my musical memoran
 dum table, in page 22. But in the D column I distribute
 them in a second way ; and in the A column I distribute
 them in a third way, which is different from either of the
 former.      And I should like to ask Mr. FAREY what a,
 strange sort of tuning it would be, if I were to consider
 those FOUR distinct wolves as ONE only, and therefore to
 distribute them alike!! I
     ' A  very radical defect,' (says  Mr. FAREV,)    in  the appli
 cation   of the Stanhope   Temperament    to practice,  as directed,
 by his Lordship, now presents itself in the mistake made ia
 supposing that equal temperaments of two successive thirds^
 or of three successive JiJ'ths, effected by means of geometric
 mean proportionals interposed between the extremes in each

                         does      here
tions agree exactly with his, so far as I use my method of
geometrical mean proportionals, to determine correctly the
bi-eyual thirds, and likewise the tri-er3ual quints. But he
imagines that he has found out                            a very    radical defect                (as he
calls     in my other mode of obtaining those same major

beatings,"   between such thirds, when compared   to such
equal       thirds;      and also between             the equal quints, respectively.
Mr. FAREV'S               radical      mistake            seems         to     consist       in    this;

which   have been obliged to use; and that he does noj

even know the clear and wide difference which there  be                                           is
tween      BEATS" and " BEATINGS."
            "
   BEATS, as applicable to this subject, are nearly synony
mous to vibrations.    For each vibration produces ONE BEAT
against the air.  So that, when, for example,      proper mu                          a
sical string   shortened,
                    is     the vibrations increase in number
inversely as the length of the string; and the BEATS in
crease,   of course, in the very same proportion.       If the
longer       string be, for instance, the note C, that shv>rter
string,      which will yield the precise sound of the perfect
octave      C   next above, will produce,   any given time, ex     in
actly twice the number of BKATS that were produced     the                                        by
longer string.   So that,  this case, we   in
                                         have two distinct
•ets    of BEATS,              but there        are       NO    BEATINGS                  whatsoever.
For     there are never       any BEATINGS      any case, when either
                                                               in

 a major third,     be made a very little imperfect,        then we in
 stantly perceive a slow BEATING, which is a third sound
 completely distinct from either of the two sets of BEATS
 above    mentioned.        The BEATING (as every one, except
 Mr.    FAREV,   well knows), increases in quickness, as the im
 perfection increases.        And it is only by means of the com
 parative quickness or slowness of the BEATINGS, that the
 exact degree   of   the imperfection     of any musical interval can
 be ascertained    by the human ear.
     The HEATINGS which denote " equal deviations from per
fection," in those intervals which are exactly similar, pos
 sess a distinguishing      equality in their effect upon the ear. by
 means    of  which, and by means of which alone, we are ca
 pable   of ascertaining, with       the requisite precision, the equa
 lity of the imperfections         in such corresponding intervals,
 when carefully compared with each other merely by the ear,
 unassisted by any monochordical or other mechanical con
 trivance.
     This phenomenon         I explain as follows.      Let us suppose,
 as an example, that I wish to compare the tri-equal quint
 DA in the first bass septave, with the tri-equal quint D A
 in the middle     septavc, of a piano forte.        If those quints be
 exactly what they ought to be, if the octaves be tuned per
 fect, and if the lower D A be struck alone, there will be
 heard three sounds       ; viz. the BEAT    of  the first bass  D, and
 the BEAT of the first bass       A,   and also   a third sound which,
 is the BKATING of the tri-equal quint            DA    in the first bass
 septavc.    In like manner, if the upper        DA   mentioned above
 be struck alone, there       will also be heard three sounds; viz,
 the BEAT of the middle D, and ihc HEAT of the middle A ;
 and likewise a third saund, which is the BKATING of the
 tri-equal quint DA in the middle scptave.              Now, let those
 two    DAs    be   struck    together, we shall then have four
 BEiTS, and also those two BKATINGS above specified, which
 two BEATINGS will have NO HEATING whatsoever between
 them.     But,   let either    of  the   two  DAs     be made either a
 little more or  a  little less perfect than a true    tri-equal quint ;
 then, the two BEATINGS above specified will produce a very
 Striking third sound, which might be denominated
                                                                  " THB
                                    K  4                       BEATING

beating     between       the two        beatings."    And, by means of
this inequality between the               two original beAtings, the in
equality of the unaltered tri-equal quint,                    and of the altered
one, will immediately appear.
   A  good ear will perceive the inequality between the two
original beatings, in the case of those two unequal quints
being struck even in succession. And, in like manner, any
two imperfect quints, or any two imperfect major thirds,
may be respectively compared by striking them in succes
sion, and by carefully observing the difference between those
beatings which    they respectively produce.
   These are facts, with which Mr. Farev appears to be
.wholly unacquainted         ;   for, in his Observations on the Stan
hope Temperament,            he, throughout,            considers beats and
beatings         as synonymous          terms ;   although it is most obvious
that they are completely and distinctly different.
   I think, however, that what I have said above will be
quite sufficient to heat him out of his error, and also to beat
into him     those       important        musical truths which         both you,
Sir, and    I,    are equally        desirous     to be able    generally to in

    In Rome, the centre from which the arts have emanated
for centuries      past    to the       surrounding countries,         about 150
years since, the         taste   of Bernini,        the Neapolitan      sculptor,
                                 *     From Tht Artist.
                                                                        infected.

                Cursory Strictures on Modern     Aft.           153
infected     and  prevailed   over   the  Florentine  and   Roman
schools.      He  had studied painting,    and seems to have beeu
enamoured with the works of Correggio, who, to avoid the
dryness of his master, Andrea Mantegna, gave prodigious
flow to the lines    of his figures and redundance to his dra
peries;    of which Bernini's statues are only caricatures, to
tally devoid of the painter's ecstatic grace and sentiment.
Before he was twenty years old he completed a marhle group,
the size of nature, of Apollo and Daphne, at the moment
the nymph is changing into a laurel tree : the delicate cha
racter of the figures, the sprightly expression, the smooth
finish of the material, and the light execution of the foliage,
so captivated the public taste, that      Michel Angelo    was for
gotten, the antique statues disregarded, and nothing looked
on with delight that was not produced by the new favourite.
It   is true, Bernini showed respectable talents in the group
above mentioned ; and had he continued to select and study
nature with diligence, he might have been a most valuable
 artist  : but sudden    success   prevented  him — he never im
 proved; the immense works crowded on him made him
 spurn all example, and consider only how he might send
 out his models and designs most speedily.          The attitudes of
 his figures are much twisted, the heads turned with a me
 retricious   grace, the countenances simper affectedly or are
 deformed by low passion;, the poor and vulgar limbs and
 bodies are loaded with draperies of such protruding or flying
 folds, as equally expose the unskil fulness of the artist and
 the solidity of the material on which he worked; his groups
 have an unmeaning connection,          and his basso relievos   are
 filled np with buildings in perspective, clouds, water, dimi
 nished figures, and attempts to represent such aerial effects
 as break down the boundaries of painting and sculpture, and
 confourid the two arts.       Pope Urban the Eighth was patron
 of this artist, and  so passionately did he admire and promote
 his works,      that, not contented with spending immense
 sums upon them, he took the antient bronze ornaments
 from the roof in the portico of the Pantheon, to the amount
 of 186,000 pounds, for Bernini to cast his bizarre and
 childish baldequin for St. Peter's, and then published their
                                                             mutual

 1 54           Cursory Strictures on Modern           Art.
 mutual shame in      a  boasting Latin inscription        affixed to the
building   he had robbed so shamefully.            Thus the     pope and
the sculptor carried all before them in their time, and sent
out a baleful influence which corrupted public taste upwards
of one hundred     years afterwards.
    Rusconi, Mocho,         Bolgio, Quesnoy (commonly called
Fiamino.o), and the       inferior,  sculptors of the time, adopted
the popular    taste,   which     their  scholars continued, and its
last puny and insipid effects are to be seen in the statues at
the Fountain of Trevi, and monument of Benedict the Four
teenth, executed by Bracci and Sybilla, in St. Peter's church,
about fifty years since.
    Nearly the same taste in the arts of design which prevailed
in Italy prevailed    also in France,      as the   latter  country was
supplied with art, or artists,        from the former: thus, when
Lewis the Fourteenth invited Bernini to come into France,
Bernini answered, '.' that he had no need of him, whilst he
had such a sculptor as Puget." Puget's works were some
what more dry and detailed than Bernini's ; Girardon's (his.
totemporary) were more heavy ; but they were all of the
same school.      The opinion of Bernini confirmed the mo
narch,   and the same bad taste was cultivated in France with
as much zeal as it was fostered in Italy ; as we see by the
works of Bouchardon, Boucher, &c., who continued it to
the same    time which        extinguished    its last feeble efforts in
both countries.
   Spain, Germany,         and   the other nations of Europe, re
ceiving their supplies of         fine art from the two countries
above mentioned,        were consequently influenced by the same
motives and trammelled in the same taste, which was at this
                                                     the point of utter
period become so degraded as to be at
dissolution, had    not    some   contrdlling   circumstances     arisen,
which assisted in its revival.
   The kiug of Naples had, in part,              cleared   the ruins   of
Herculaneum      and Pompeii,        which exposed to view streets,
dwelling-houses, temples, theatres, baths, and public places,
nearly in the same state as when they were inhabited 1 700
                                                  back to the light of
years before: these discoveries brought
day, as it were by        miracle,     700 antient   paintings, and a
                                                              prodigious

 prodigious number of bronze statues and busts of the finest
 Greek sculpture.
      The success of these discoveries, and the interest they
excited, stimulated          the popes, Roman nobility, and anti
quarians,        to make excavations wherever there was a proba
bility their labours would             be rewarded.   These researches
 fortunately recovered         fro.n oblivion    innumerable   piece*  of
 exquisite sculpture;           many of the most precious formed
 the Clementine          museum     ; many enriched the       Borghese,
 Albani, and other collections ; several passed into Germany,
 Holland, Sweden, Russia, France, and Spain : England was
 not insensible to the opportunity,             and several intelligent
•and spirited individuals         profited by this  profusion of antient
 treasure. Such acquisitions roused attention from all quar
 ters; they were eagerly visited, greedily examined, disser
 tations and memoirs were written concerning them, and
 systematic inquiries into their principles published.           During
 all this research        and analysts, frequent comparisons were
 made with the modern works, the remains of the bad taste
 above mentioned, and which were found so deficient in every
 excellence that they were universally abandoned to contempt.
 The      interested antiquarian, with sordid cruelty, and to raise
  the }irice of his own commodity, whispered that modern
  talents were unequal to the meanest of these productions,
  and sometimes he found a senseless purchaser, whose only
  measure      of intelligence     was the abundance     of his wealth    ;
  who would         pay dearly enough for any thing that was called
  antient, to be received        into the number of the cognoscenti,
  and join in the outcry against modern ability.
       All this, however, brought in a new and" severer mode of
  study among the artists, with a more diligent attention to
  nature and the antique, and has enabled some of them to
  exhibit performances much more on a level with the merit
  of    those works than the insensible can feel, or the interested
  choose to own.
       Having marked these phenomena in the hemisphere of
   art, we should now turn our thoughts more particularly to
   England, and see in what manner our own country was
   jiffected    by   their influence.     Previous to the Reformation,
                                                                although

  although Italian artists were employed in ornamenting our
  churches and tombs, yet in the old histories, records, and
 contracts of public       buildings,    there are abundant names    of
 English painters       and   sculptors, who appear to have been
 considered able masters          in their time, perhaps not inferior
 to their    Italian   fellow-workmen.          But after Henry the
 Eighth's separation from the church of Rome, Elizabeth,
 proceeding in the reformation, destroyed the pictures and
 images in the churches ; strictly forbidding any thing of the
 kind to be admitted in future, under the severest penalties,
as being catholic and idolatrous.             This entirely prevented
the exercise of historical painting, or sculpture, in this
country; at the very time that RarTaelle and Michel Angelo_
had brought those arts into the highest estimation on the
 continent. — The rebellion, \n 1648, completed what the
reformation had begun ; the fanatics defaced whatever they
could,   that the former inquisition had spared ; they broke
painted windows and tombs, carried away the monumental
brass, and church-plate, crying, " Cursed he be, that doth
the work of the Lord deceitfully !"-?-Thus the artist, terrified
by the threats of the sovereign, the denunciation of death or
perpetual imprisonment from the laws, and scared by fana
tical anathemas, found that his only hope of safety rested
upon quitting for ever a profession, which enclosed him on
all sides with the prospect of misery and destruction. From
this time, and from these causes, we scarcely hear of any
attempt at historical art by an Englishman, until it was
again called forth by the benign influence of the present
reign.
    When     the   liberal spirit    of Charles the First desired    to
adorn the architecture of Whitehall with the graces of paint
ing, he was obliged to seek the artist in a foreign land ; he
had no subject equal to the task : Rubens and Vandyck were
employed    :  and when the king's bust was to be done,      Vandyck
painted three views of his face, a front, a side, and a three-
quarter, which were sent to Bernini in Rome, by whom it
was executed in marble.          If our kings and nobility had con
tinued   to inhabit     castles,   as  in the feudal times, painting
and sculpture would have          been but little wanted ; for, if the
                                                                 walls

or shot,    and   contained   retreats   to secure   the   inhabitants
from    the enemy, the      end    of that kind of dwelling        was
answered    : but in the times succeeding Charles the First,
the improved state of society and knowledge had induced
the great to build commodious villas and palaces, in which
the architectural distribution made the sister-arts absolutely
necessary     to  uniformity   and   completion.      Still ingenious
foreigners were employed for this purpose, whilst the native
was treated with contempt, both at home and abroad, for
his inability in those arts which law and religion had for
bidden him to practise.
    As this suppression of ability     was extremely    impolitic and
dishonourable       to the country,    let us inquire for a moment
on what scriptural authority the prohibition        which occasioned
it  was   supported.     Painting and sculpture were banished
from the churches, that they might not be idolatrously
worshipped : and this is just ; the divine law orders they
shall not he worshipped, but utters no prohibition against
the arts themselves: on the contrary, divine precept directed
images of cherubim to be made, whose wings should extend
over the ark of ihe covenant, and cherubim tobe embroidered
on the curtains which surrounded it.            This decision in fa
 vour of the arts being employed for proper purposes in sa
 cred buildings, is so clear and strong, that it could only be
 overlooked,     or opposed, by infatuated bigotry.
    A succession of foreign artists, as has been observed,
 were employed in almost every work of importance, from
 the time of Charles the First, until within forty years of the
 present day.      The painters, Vandyck, Lely, Vcrrio, Kneller
 and Casali, succeeded to each other; as did also the sculp
 tors, Gibber, Gibbons, Scheemakers,            Rysbraek,    Bertocini,
 and Roubiliac.       This variety of   artists  (sculptors are more
 particularly meant) from different countries, French, Fle
 mings, and Italians, sometimes brought the taste of John
 Goujon or Puget, sometimes a debased imitation of John of
  Bologna and the Florentine school, and sometimes the taste
 of Bernini; but never a pure style and sound principles.
 After the Reformation, the chief employment of sculpture

 158                 Cursory Strictures on Modern                Art.
 was in sepulchral monuments, which, during the reigns of
 James the First and his son Charles, were chiefly executed,
 by Frenchmen or Flemings, scholars of John Goujon, still
 regulated        hy the principles     iheir   master           acquired from
                                                               had
 Primaticcioj      pupil of Raffaelle.
                        the                               Some of these work*
 have great merit, particularly the tombs of sir John Norris,
 and sir Francis Vere, in the same chapel with Roubiliac's
 monument of lady E. Nightingale in Westminster abbey.
   The rebuilding of London, in                     the       reign of Charles the
 Second,      gave       some
                     employment                     to       sculpture.  Gibber's
works           most conspicuous of that period : his mad
            are the
figures on the Bethlehem gates have a natural sentiment,
but are    drawn; his bas-relief on the pedestal of London
            ill
monument           is   not  conceived, but stiff and clumsy
                              ill                              the                 in
execution     ;    his clothed figures in the Royal Exchange strut
like dancing-masters, and have the importance of coxcombs.
But with all his faults, what he left     far preferable to the
                                                     is
succeeding works.     The figures in St. Paul's church, and
the conversion  of the saint in the pediment, partake strongly
of Bernini's affectation;           and Iron) that time to the establish
ment of the Royal Academy we must expect to see every
piece of sculpture more or less tinctured with the same bad
taste, especially the sepulchral monuments, to which, after
the statues   and basso-relievos last noticed, we must chiefly
look for  the  progress of sculpture amongst us.
   It will be proper here to remark that all the Grecian sculp
ture was arranged in three classes    the group of figures
                                                :           the                    ;
single statue; and alto or basso relievo.                            The   first    two
classes were suited to all insulated situations,                     and the latter"
to fill pannels in walls.    These classes not                       only serve all
architectural purposes,  but adorn, harmonise,                       and finish iu
forms   :   every attempt to make other combinations                       between
sculpture and architecture will be found unreasonable, and
degrading to one as well as the other but Bernini, whose ;
character and works we have already noticed, seems to have
thought that he had the privilege of equally subverting art
and nature in his works.      shall mention the following in
                                    I

                          I     their extreme absurdities will

not seen the things themselves.            In the area before the
church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva he raised a bronze
elephant on    a pedestal,   and  on the elephant's back placed
an Egyptian obelisk     :  the architecture  of the east window in
Si. Peter's church     he has loaded     with many tons weight of
stucco clouds, out of which         issue huge rays, intended for
light or glory, of the same materials, but long and thick
enough for the beams of a house.              Extravagances of this
kind,    and  many others that he has committed, have fortu
nately bad little effect upon us, because some have been ne
cessarily connected with catholic churches, and others in
troduced in fountains, which are only frequent in hot coun
tries : we werci however, the dupes of his school, until na
tive genius gained sufficient judgment and strength to cor
rect its errors, and supply a better style of art.        Before the
time of Bernini,     two kinds of sepulchral monuments pre
 vailed  ; one  from  the highest antiquity, which was a sarco
 phagus, either plain, or covered with basso-relievos, with or
 without the statue of the deceased on its top. The other
 kind was introduced by Michel Angelo, in the mausoleum
 of Julius the Second ; and those of the Medici family, in
 the chapel of St. Lorenzo, at Florence.           In these the sar
 cophagus, as in the former       kind,   was suited to the niche or
 architecture against which it was placed, and surmounted
 or surrounded by statues of the deceased and his moral attri
 butes.     Both these practices were rational and proper; the
 one for plainer, the other for more magnificent tombs. This
 branch of sculpture was of too much importance to be neg
 lected by Bernini    ; he stripped it of its antient simple gran
 deur, leaving it neither group, statuR, basso-relievo, sarco
  phagus, or trophy, but an absurd mixture of all, placed
 against    a dark-coloured     marble pyramid, and thus sacri
  ficing all that is valuable in sculpture to what he conceived
  a picturesque effect.      The pyramid is, from its immense
  size, solid base, diminishing upwards, a building intended
  to last thousands of years : how ridiculous, then, to raise a
  little pyramid of slab marble, an inch thick, on a neat pe
  destal, to be the back ground of sculpture, belonging to
  none of the antient classes, foisted into architecture, with
                                                               which

 which it has neither connection or harmony, and in vhictt
 it appears equally disgusting and deformed ! The first mo
 numents he raised of this kind were two in the Chigi chape!
 in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, in Rome : this
 novelty soon found its way into every country in Europe ;
 our Westminster        abbey   is an unfortunate       instance  of  its
 prevalence.       Rysbrack and Roubiliac spread the popularity
 of this  taste in England    ; but as the first of these sculptors
 was   a mere   workman,     too insipid to give pleasure, and too
 dull to offend greatly,     we  shall 'dismiss him without further
notice.      The other deserves more attention.          Roubiliac was
 an enthusiast in his art, possessed of considerable talents;
he copied vulgar nature with zeal, and some of his figures
 seem alive ; but their characters are mean, their expressions
 grimace, and their forms frequently bad ; his draperies are
 worked with great diligence and labour, from the most dis
 agreeable examples in nature, the folds being either heavy
or meagre, frequently without a determined general form,
and hung on his figures with           littleNineaning.    He grouped
two figures together (for he never attempted more) better
than most of his contemporaries ; but his thoughts are con
ceits, and his compositions epigrams.              This artist went to
Italy, in company with Mr. Pond,           an English painter:   he was
absent from home three months, going and returning, stayed
three days in Rome, and laughed at the sublime remains of
antient sculpture ! The other sculptors of this time were or
dinary men ; their faults were common, and their works
have P0 beauty to rescue them from oblivion.
    Thus    sve   have seen   the  nobler efforts    of painting    and
sculpture driven out of the country by reforming violence
and puritanical fury ; sculpture reduced to the narrow limits
of monument-making,           and  by these means degraded to a
sort of trade   ;  and this department supplied from the corrupt
source of Bernini's school,         and     not unfrequently through
the worst mediums.          In this state the art continued until
the establishment      of  the Royal Academy settled a course        of
study, both at home and abroad, which developed the powers
of English genius, till then unknown to the natives, and
denied by foreigners.

 which we are most habitually acquainted, was discovered
 by Newton. Since that period nothing important has been
 added to the discoveries of that great philosopher;                  and the
 objections made by some            to this part of his experiments,
 proceed either from want           of examination, or from new ex
 periments ill understood.             They establish irresistibly the^
 various refrangibility     of  the   particles of white light; the dif
 ferent colours of these particles ; and lastly, that the colours
 of bodies    are alone     owing to      the   property they possess of
 throwing out, reflecting, or transmitting              some    of these par
 ticles or rays more than others.
    Hence it follows, that, independently                  of the refractive
 power, which is proper, in fact, for analysing light, every
 coloured body presents by its action another method of
making this analysis more or less completely.
    Before discussing' this last method, which is my present
object in particular, it may be useful to examine the first
method, with the view of thereby clearing up or confirm
ing sever*! peculiarities.
    Although the question            has  been     often agitated, it has
never yet been satisfactorily resolved,             viz.  if there are rcaliy
Seven    distinct   classes   of colours in        the solar spectrum, or
rather   a single series     of    shades    from the commencement
to the end, blended        in an insensible manner.             Some philo
sophers arc even uncertain if Newton has distinctly affirmed
one or other of the propositions.
    On the first view, the opinion of this father of optics does
not    appear  doubtful   ;  for lie relates that         a person, whose
sight was better than his own,           was requested by himself to
draw across the spectrum lines on the confines of each co
lour ; and that the results of this operation, several time*
repeated,    agreeing tolerably well, he then fixed definitively

the spaces of each colour, and found that they had a certain
relation with the tones of a musical gamut *. This same
division, expressed in cyphers, serves Newton afterwards for
establishing different calculations, and particularly the me
thod by which he determined the course of the shades of
coloured rings : he returns, besides, in several places of his
work,      to speak  of the confines     of this   and that colour,    and
directs his experiments accordingly.               We cannot suppose,
therefore, that he was not persuaded himself of this funda
mental proposition,       or that he hesitated        to announce   it po
sitively.
   'With     respect to the    truth of the proposition itself,       it is
«asy to ascertain     it in several ways.-
    1st,    By repeating Newton's experiment, which is the se
venth of the second book of the first part of his Optics, it
is merely sufficient, without searching for the utmost ex
actitude, to procure in a dark chamber a solar spectrum not
too confined in its breadth. We there see distinctly enough,
if  not all the sections of the colours,         at least some   of them,
particularly in the region of the most refrangible rays.                 If
we also arrange an apparatus for giving a very long and very
narrow spectrum by means of a small lens placed before the
prism    ;  then, by receiving the image upon a card rather
nearer     the lens than its focus, we shall there find the blue
in particular, terminated at each end by a straight line, very
clearly defined.
    2d, The disk of the moon,             when full, and far from the
horizon,      observed   with    a simple prism, displays upon her
lengthened image several circles which               indicate separations
of colours perfectly unblended.
    3d, Examine also with the prism the coloured fringes of
a white rectangular body, a little large, and well illuminated,
you will remark on one side a red stripe falling into the
yellow abruptly, which, in its turn, loses itself in the white;
and, on the other hand, some               blue, distinctly enough be
tween the white and        a  violet stripe : from this it woukl fol
low that there, are only four kinds of colours.

    4th, Lastly, if we look at       a  white and narrow body placed
upon     a black ground, such         as   a  strip of paper,    a thread     of
silk, or    a metallic    needle,    there     will only appear, for one
of    these objects,   if  we arc     properly placed, three         colours,
 red, green, and violet;      and scarcely        can   we   perceive     either
in   the one or the other any softening            of  the shades.
    These various phjenomena are incompatible with the sup
position of an uniform gradation of colours throughout the
whole length of the spectrum, that is to say, incompatible
with a variation of strength, owing to one sole and uniform
law ; but they do not contradict the results of the experi
ment which gave to Newton seven classes of particular co
lours.     If, in some cases, as we shall soon see, refrangi-
bility reduces the apparent colours to four principal kinds,
or to three, or at other times shows them in a state more or
less confused, it is au irresistible consequence of the relation
existing between the breadth of the body observed, the angle
of dispersion of the rays, and the distance at which the
ima^c is received.
    We may, by means          of  a  figure, account for these effects          :
it  results from this, that, in order to obtain by refraction the
most colours when the rays are primitively parallel, there
must be a very small luminous object, a considerable angle
of dispersion,    and a very great removal           of  the image    :   hence
the difficulty of repeating with success the experiment of
New ton, where he proposes to disengage as much as pos
sible the heterogeneous rays from each other *.
    This   we may also infer       from      the very interesting       experi
ments of      M. Roehon upon           the    light of the fixed stars f.
This philosopher       undertook these examinations on accomu
of   the advantage     of  the smallness of the apparent diameter
of    these stars ; and    in order to attain his object, he inge
niously arranged before an excellent telescope an achromatic
prism, of his own invention, with a variable angle : with
this apparatus, and the refracting angle of his prism being
14° only, he saw among others the star Sinus, the spec
trum of which        was    almost entirely composed of three co-

lours  ;  viz.  reel, green, and violet ; the two former yielding
between them        a feeble shade of yellow, and the two last also
a  slight gradation.         It is evident from what precedes, that
here there must have been wanting some condition requisite
for the greater simplification of the light; this condition is
correspondent with a greater removal of the image, or a more
considerable angle of dispersion.                The author soon after
wards increased the refracting angle to 50°, upon which de
pends    that   of dispersion ; but another cause then comes to
alter the   results. In proportion to the increase of the thick
ness   of  the prism,       several particles     of   the light became too
feeble to be transmitted ;          the colours      disappeared       gradually
in  a certain order, and at last nothing               remained       except one
of a straw-coloured yellow. The comparison of the spectra
of stars of different magnitudes affords the moans of observ
ing the same gradation in the penetrating power of the va
rious luminous rays ; a power which is nothing else than
their illuminating faculty pointed out by Newton in this
same order.
   These experiments, therefore, do not alter in any respect
the data admitted as to the species of the component parti
cles  of light ; on the contrary, they confirm them.
   But some discoveries posterior to those of Newton,                       made
by effecting      the   refraction by different bodies, have taught
us that the particular distribution of rays upon the spectrum
was not invariable.          According      to the nature     of  these bodies,
and independently         of their density      and   of  the aperture     of the
refracting angle, we sometimes see                 the angle      of mean re
fraction changed, as well as that of the dispersion of the
extreme rays, and sometimes also the relative separation of
the intermediate colours,            but without        their order being in
verted ;   at least, there is no simultaneous action of several
refracting substances         properly combined. Thence is derived,
as  we know, the principle of the achromatic glasses so admi
rably constructed,        first by.Dollond, and since perfected (as
be thought) by Dr. Blair*.               To this last author we are in-

this subject.
  In    some   of   these he determines,             with   a great deal        of   care,
the dispersive power of various substances.   He finds some
of them  which  possess it in a degree considerably stronger
than that of common or crown glass ; such as, for example,
sal-ammoniac,        the muriatic           acid in particular,        and, above
all, the smoking          muriate of antimony.                  But what is not
less remarkable,         is,   the displacing        of   the   limits of the co
lours in the dispersions caused                 by
                                     these different substances;
for the less dispersive substances, in general, cause the mean
direction to pass     the junction of the green and the blue;
                       by
while other substances, such    as Jlint glass, essential oils,
and metallic solutions, throw the limit of these same colours
much  nearer the red    and   is, on the contrary, carried
                                 ;         it
again towards  the violet upon the spectrum produced                                    by
the muriatic acid.   These varieties induced Dr. Blair to
prepare object glasses  more truly achromatic than the com
mon ones.        He made them of several forms, one, among
the rest,   by   means    of        an assemblage    of curved glasses, be-
twetn which he enclosed               a   solution of muriate of antimony,
mixed with muriatic acid, to the precise quantity necessary
for compensating     its action, for the displacing of the
                               by
green rays, which the other substance would have occa
sioned.
   In short, we may form an idea of the comparative ex
actitude of the methods of Dollond and Blair,    means of              by
two very simple figures, on which we trace the course of
the rays, with reference to the axis of each object glass.

 I    have dwelt some time upon                  these details, because              they

 now give a recapitulation of all that precedes,                  which      I shall
 endeavour to do with precision.
    White light is decomposed by refraction into an infinite
number of parts or rays. They have a different colour at
every point in the length               of  the spectrum ; and this colour
 cannot be varied by a new refraction, if the simplification of
the spectrum         be at the degree to which Newton carried it.
Though in this simplified spectrum                 the lines   of demarcation
between      the    colours arc by no means very perceptible,                   it is
impossible, however, to ascribe the                gradations of their tints
to one and the same law. Various observations establish the
existence of several distinct species of colours ; and their di
vision     into seven classes,          as given by Newton,          agrees    with
a great number         of phenomena.             Yet  some bodies, by their
peculiar refractive power, derange the spaces of the colours
in the spectrum ; for example, the green rays are, in some
instances, brought nearer the red, in others nearer the vio
let; which proves that the dispersion of the rays does not
depend      absolutely on their own nature. Such arc the prin
cipal    observations       it appeared to me necessary to make, in
order to show the present state of our knowledge ; and \
shall now proceed to examine the action                    of coloured bodies
upon light.
    I  have   shown* that           all  kinds   of transparent bodies, of
different colours, which            1 have observed, transmit ultimately
only the red, or green,             or  violet rays. The progressive ab
sorption never finishes by any other colours, and I long
sought in vain for a substance in which the final absorption
should be       of   the yellow or blue rays.             Such a result could
not fail     to excite my attention.              I remarked, that, under
certain circumstances, the colours exhibited by refraction
were almost wholly these three, red, green, and violet; that
sometimes yellow appeared to arise from a mixture of red
and green, and blue from a mixture of green and violet;

glasses on each other, indicated as possible.    I perceived
too, that the tints of the seven orders of colours might be
imitated by the three primitive colours alone which I have
mentioned*.             This     was sufficient to suggest to me the idea,
that perhaps        these   kinds of rays were all that really
                                three
existed ; a proposition  that required to be examined with
care proportioned to its importance. Accordingly I inquired
into the probabilities that might be brought to support                                              it,
and compared          it   with all the phenomena                    of colour            that oc
curred to me        ;     and lastly    I    proved        it   by   direct experiments.
The details of         shall reserve for the last place, begin
                      these     I
ning with an account of the others.
 I  have already stated that the supposition of three colours
was not inconsistent with the formation                                  of all     the tints        of
the spectrum.           Nor      does contradict the unchangeableness

lar to that which               really occurs, nothing more                         is   necessary
than to conceive           it   composed of        three spectrums partly over

erected     an ordinatc,       and   afterward drawn the arbitrary in
clined line ad, then b g cutting the former in c, and lastly
e h cutting the preceding iny.                  I suppose that the modi
fications of the red rays, on which their different refrangi-
bility depends,        are represented      by the ordinates correspond
ing to 'he line      ad: these quantic.es express nothing relative
either to the velocity of the rays, or the magnitude of their
particles ; perhaps they may have a relation to their density,
or to any other quality whatever that constitutes their dif
ference.       In Newton's       system     of   seven classes   of primitive
colours,     there    are likewise      red rays differently refrangible ;
this therefore is not       a  difficulty peculiar to the state of things
I  aai examining.          In   like manner the ordinates of the line
g  b will   be the modifications         of  the green     ; and those  of  the
line h   e the     modifications     of  the violet.      This being under
stood,     it becomes       evident that the first division of colours
from a to       b  will be red alone ; that it will be followed by a
mixture       or combination         of  green     and   red from b to c,    in
which     the quantity      of  the latter     will predominate     more and
more, and consequently give orange; after which another
mixture of red and green will proceed from c to d, in which
the green will predominate more and more, forming yel
low   ;  then from d      toe will     be green alone ; from e
                                                                      \.of the
mixture      of   green and violet that produces blue ; from^'to g
the mixture producing             indigo; and lastly fromg to h pure
violet.
    But another very striking property of the spectrum,
which has,not hitherto been explained, is the greater bright
ness    of the.yellow compared with all              the others.    This pro
ceeds evidently in my figure from being the sum                    of the red
and   of   the green     in  the same space.          In  the blue too there
                                                                              is

is an augmentation of light by the                  union of
                                                the green and
violet ; but the effect is much less than in the preceding in
stance, both from the nature of those colours, and their ex
tent, though there is some trace of it in the spectrum when
properly displayed.   In short, 1 have not by this figure pre
tended to exhibit any thing more than what may possibly
happen. For this reason I have limited the ordinates of each
colour by a right line merely; for, as ths law of their pro
gression is not known, so that it is impossible to give the pre
cise curve, I have adopted the simplest line as sufficient for
my purpose.
 The striking         agreement    of my hypothesis with                the pecu
liaritiesof the spectrum excited me the more to apply it
to the dial of colours. This coloured figure has such sin
gular properties, that the mind cannot easily bend itself to
them.       How   indeed can it conceive the existence               of   an infi
nite number of luminous rays, all different yet equally sim
ple? How is      that taken in pairs from the extremities of
                  it,

            American Potash ; Process                    for   obtaining   it.
 JL HE name of American potash is given to an alkaline sub
stance, in compact masses which have visibly undergone
fusion.   This alkali seems to be the produce of a ley of
ashes and lime,            with the addition of sea-salt.        The result
is a very deliquescent and                 caustic substance, susceptible of
entering into fusion long before becoming red-hot.      If the
proportions of sea-salt and lime have been sufficient, all the
potash is combined with the acid of the former, and has sepa
rated the soda, at the same time that the Irme is precipitated
hi carbonate:           thus fills kind of alkali must be considered as
a mixture          of caustic        soda    and        muriate of potash. That
which       is    red   owes    its colour to            sulphur and charcoal : it
also partly owes this colour to a little iron. There are first,
second     and third sorts of American potash. The laundresses
of    Paris frequently pay much more for them than they are
worth       in point of alkaline
                              properties. The same effects
might be produced if they added to common potash or to
wood ashes a small quanty of quick-lime, with this difference,
however,  that their expense would be considerably dimi
nished. To conclude, all the American potashes I examined
also       contain carbonic acid.               In      the departments      of France
where salt is made, the mixture of sea-salt and lime with
ashes,       before their           lixiviation, might           be   turned to great
 profit. It is a very simple operation, and I only speak of
 it from  some experiments made upon a very large scale,

 doubles the price of the American           potash.
 Advantages      resulting from tite Substitution       of Sail of Soda
                        in Place of native Soda.
     Among   the hest processes      known for obtaining the salt or
carbonate of soda, some         of them are susceptible of improve
ments, which have not yet been published. A chemist, who
 is unaccustomed to operations on a large scale, will be able
to judge which      of   these processes    deserves the preference in
point   of facility or ceconomy.
     M. Pelletan jnn. has presented to the academy of Rouen
some salt of soda of his own manufacture.                   The experi
ments of the committee of which I was a member, and
those of some dyers of scarlet cotton, prove that this salt
of soda of M. Pelletan has given results which, in point of
beauty, may be compared with those of the best Spanish
soda, and that the employment of this salt was much more
(Economical.
    As to its ceconomy, we find that this last point depends
upon the relative prices of soda and of salt of soda.              In all
cases, it will depend upon the manufacturers of this salt to
preserve   to it the particular advantage       of a constant degree of
alkalinity, while      the sodas    of commerce often vary among
themselves    as 1 to 2 : the    employment of salt of soda, there
fore, requires much less workmanship             and time.
Prospect    of  a speedy Manufacture          of this Salt   of  Soda in
                  France upon a very Large Scale.
    Several other manufacturing         chemists    have   proposed    the
manufacture of       salt   of soda,   the demand for      which,    if  it
could supply the     place of the     soda  of Spain in all its   appli
cations, might become            so extensive,     that foreign    sodas
would fall into disrepute.
    I advised M. Arnaud to send into France the salt of the
Spanish sodas deprived of water by desiccation, which
would    in some measure         diminish    the  expense    of carriage
                                                                      and

and custom-house             duties.       I gave this advice to      M.   Pelletan
also.      This salt docs not always crystallize                     with facility,
particularly in warm seasons :                   by this method the manu
facture will go on much faster*.

                                        Alkalies.
     Among       the various alkalies          of commerce, none of them
offer either soda or potash                  in their state of purity.          The
least impure are those which contain merely carbonic acid
and water : afterwards come those which contain earths,
carbonate of lime, sulphur, charcoal, and particularly the
alkaline muriates, and sulphates, of which it is but too
true that for some years             a fraudulent mixture has been made,
extremely prejudicial               to   manufactures        in which     alkali    is
used.
     For    a long      time it has been           a great   desideratum to dis
cover a prompt and easy process for trying potash, soda,
natron, and the other alkalies, which might boboth within
the reach of buyers, and certain in its results.                        The areo
meter, so convenient in the spirit-trade, and even in that of
the sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, is insufficient in
this respect.          It  has been        successively suggested to employ
    • Since
              writing the above memoir, I learnt that M. Carny, to whom
France     is indebted    for a remarkably expeditious process of manufacturing
gunpowder,      has formed an establishment        at  Dieuzc, where he has already,
within one vear, manufactured twelve hundred quintals of an excellent salt
of soda, which he sells under three different forms. The 6rst is in a very
dry powder. The second is in irregular masses, and still contains eome
water of crystallization,      The third is in well formed and colourless crystals.

 M.   Carnv sells it at 'JOO livrci for 100 kilogrammes delivered at Rouen, while
the fine Russian potash it sold at the same price, although 10 per cent,
weaker. 1 rejoice in having an opportunity of publishing this new obligation
of our country towards one of          its most respectable citizens, who  has not as
yet received a recompense proportioned              to his merit.    The experiments
 bei;un at Rouen, under the direction of          M. Vital!s, upon dyeing cotton red
 after the Adrianople      method, promise the most happy results ; they already
 produce a saving of 70 per cent, from the employment of this salt, compared
 with the best Spanish soda. The manufacture ot M. Carny might be raised
 to 2,500 metrical quintals annually ; it is founded upon theccconomisation of
 the sulphate of soda, of which           the salt springs in France present us with
 large quantities.

  various acids, and some         of their combinations with prcci-
  pitable bases.     The sulphuric acid pure        and  uncombined,
  in my opinion, deserves the preference, as it is found every
  where at a low price, and can be brought to the same state
  of concentration.
     The process which I found to be the most expeditious
  for judging comparatively of the value of various speci
  mens '0f alkali, consists in ascertaining how many centiemes
  of their weight they require of sulphuric acid for their sa
  turation.    If this process is not as yet within the reach of
  all buyers, we shall easily lind at least persons intelligent
  enough to jxecute it well ; for, independently of other che
  mists, there are apothecaries everywhere who can easily make
  such trials.
                  Description    of the Alkali-meter.
     The instrument which I have called the Alkali -meter,          is a
  glass tube eight or nine inches long, and seven or eight lines
 in diameter. It is closed at one end,          the other terminated
 in a kind of small funnel, with a beak         a (fig. 3, Plate IV.)
 adhering to the tube by a neck with an aperture of two
 lines and a half.       Upon the shoulder which supports this
 neck is a hole b, for letting the air out and in.         Fig. 3. is a
 vertical section of this instrument mounted upon a stand
c, d, in which      it is  solidly   fixed  with mastic, by means
of    a  kind of hook       (shown      at c, d) left for this pur
 pose at the lower extremity       of   the tube.    In order  to faci
 litate the carriage of this instrument, it is furnished with a
kind of tin      case, without a bottom, having a lid e: the
other party, being, like the former, indicated by punctured
lines, is   a  tube  open at both ends, and upon which, in.
order to fasten the lid, there must be a swelling g, g.
    The alkali-meter ought to contain easily 38 grammes, or
76 demi-grammes, because each division, or degree, which
we trace afterwards upon the instrument,          represents a demi-
granuue of this liquor,        which it is extremely important to
proportion accurately     as  follows :

merce, at 66 degrees of Baume's areometer; afterwards
put in equilibrium, in a good balance, a vessel of porcelain
or glass, and pour into it     a given weight of the above acid,
say a hectogramme ;       add carefully, on account of the caloric
which is liberated, nine hectogrammes of pure water, then
stir it well with a glass rod ; and then put it into a bottle,
which you must cork up, that no alteration, either by
dust or by evaporation,      may take place.
                  Graduation   of  the  Alkali-meter.
    The alkali-meter      is then graduated by given weights of
this liquor in the following manner : Place the instrument
in perfect equilibrium in a balance, and introduce into it
very exactly two grammes or four demi.grammes             of the test
liquor;     place  the  tube  afterwards    in a vertical position,
and mark the level by a small scratch with a diamond ; pour
in once more, and all at one time, 36 grammes or 62 demi-
grammes of the liquor, and mark this level also by a scratch :
after this, empty the instrument, and draw a mark on the
other four vertical parallel lines; and forming three spaces
of about one line       between    each, mark on the two extre
mities two small transverse lines, making right angles with
the other four; then write 0 in the upper part, and 72 in
the lower; pour liquor into the tube afterwards, up to the
point marked 72 ; put the instrument once more in equili
brium, and introduce one after the other 71 demi-grammes.
of   the test liquor,  taking care to mark, each time, one point
in the middle scale : this being accomplished, trace regularly,
by four and four points, lines across the three scales ; then
trace in the same manner, upon all the other points, lines
through the middle scale only : engrave, after this, on one side,
and opposite to each fourth division, the cyphers 4. 8. 12.

description more intelligible.
    I shall, by and by, inform my readers how and wherefore
I  arranged this instrument so as, if necessary, to supply the
 place of the Bertholli-meter.         The marlcs are made with
 Tery Uufc trouble by employing a glazier's diamond.

    Besides the alkali-meter and the test liquor the following
 articles must be procured         :
     1. Syrup of violets.
    2.   A    small balance     : those    for weighing gold coins will
 answer ; we may employ smaller, however.
    3. Weights of 2 drachms 44 grains and two-thirds of a
 grain.
    4. A measure         of   a demi-decilitre,     or rather, according
 to the old system, the small measure answering to the six
 teenth of a Paris pint (those which have no lids are pre
 ferable)   ;  this  small     vessel   is  intended    to   give   any two
 measures of water, and its capacity is not of very great conse
 quence : any other vessel of nearly the same capacity will
 answer.
    5. Common drinking-glasses : those whose edges are
 turned outwards should be preferred : if common glasses
 only   are used,    before decanting a portion        of    the liquor into
 them    as   I  have described,      we must give     a  slight coating of
 oil, fat or    grease,    to part  of their orifice, which will      present
 an irregular     flowing down the outer sides.
    6. Small chips of wood or matches from                       which     the
 sulphured ends have been taken off.
    7. A bottle of water and an earthen nlate.
    8. Lastly, for soda, hard American potash, and natron,
-there must be a metal pestle and mortar of about six inches
 in  its greatest   diameter.
    The whole being arranged, you may easily                     proceed    to
 the trial yi     any given alkali       ; we shall   take    potash   as an

   water ; pour it back again into the glass, in which you must
   still pour a measure full of pure water : stir this new mix
   ture also three or four times within half an hour, in order
   to facilitate the precipitation of a slight sediment, which
   soon falls down.          This sediment being completely formed,
   slope the glass with caution, in order to fill with clear
   liquor    the small measure;       then empty this last into another
  large     glass ; after this     place round the edges of a plate
  drops of syrup of violets ; pour also into the alkali-meter
  test liquor until the line marks 0: take it afterwards with
  the left hand, inclining it upon the glass which contains the
  moiety of the clean alkaline solution : the acid liquor will fall
  into it by hasty drops, or in a very small thread, which you
  may moderate at pleasure by retarding the entrance of the air
  at the lateral hole or vent, upon which must be placed the end
 of    the finger  ;  at the same time, with a small stick or match
 assist the mixture, and facilitate the development          of the car
 bonic acid, which is manifested by effervescence.           When you
 have emptied the alkali-meter to about the line marked 40, try
 if    the   saturation   approaches, by drawing your small stick
 from the mixture and resting it upon one of the drops of
 syrup of violets, which should become green if the potash
 is not of a very inferior quality.            If, on the contrary, the
 violet colour is not altered, or, what would be worse, if it
 be changed into red, there would be in the first case an indi
 cation     of saturation,     and in the    second  a proof of super-
 saturation.       But this    is not the case with     good potashes   :
at that line, the liquor tried can alter the syrup of violets
into green only ; or cause to return to the violet, and even to
the green, the drops which had been changed into red at
the time of a former trial : we must, therefore, in general
add more acid, which occasions a new effervescence ; this
addition must be always made with caution, and we must
touch every time a drop of syrup of violets in order to stop.
When at last the latter assumes a red hue, then, after having
restored the alkali-meter         to a perpendicular position, in order
to see     at what   line  the  testing liquor stops, you must reckon

tion. The mean term of potashes is 55: this implies that
they require for their saturation fifty-five hundredths of their
weight of sulphuric acid.

The Code      of Herdth and Longevity ; or, A           concise  View
    of   the  Principles   calcubated    for   the   Preservation   of
    Health, and the Attainment of long Life. Being an
    Attempt to prove the Practicability of condensing; within
    a narrow Compass, the most material Information hitherto
    accumulated, regarding the different Arts and Sciences,
   xor any particular Branch thereof.            By Sir JOHN SIN-
    cr.Aiit, Bart.— 4. Vols. Svo.
OIR JOHN SINCLAIR          observes,    that the multitude   of books
published on the subject of health are so exceedingly nu
merous, that it almost requires a life to read through the
whole,     and that the only satisfaction thut can arise is from
this aggregated knowledge, collected from certain parts con
tained in each work. With astonishing industry the inde
 fatigable baronet has waded through the stores of antient
 arid modern lore, and       culled from each what appeared to
him adapted to the purpose. His Code of Health and
 Longevity is therefore not an original production, founded
 upon his own experience ; but extracts from all the learned
writers on that subject in every age and country of the
 world.     This plan first suggested itself to Dr. Thornton,
 which    he brought to some degree       of perfection in  the Philo
 sophy of Medicine, or, as he has ingenuously confessed in
 the title-page, Medical Extracts on the Nature of Health
 and Disease; and sir    John Sinclair     has made the greatest use
 of  this able performance,      everywhere quoting it as a work
 of  the first authority ; and indeed the Code of Health is an

                                                                    up

up in detail what that learned and ingenious physician has
in several places only slightly touched upon, tearful perhaps
of making his work too voluminous,                and reserving himself
more particularly to what related to disease, where doctor
Thornton is sufficiently in detail and -full, and which seemed
most to demand the attention of            a  physician.     The Code of
Health opens with preliminary                 observations     "  On the
advantages    to   be derived   from   arranging     and  condensing     the
knowledge already accumulated."                The author here judi
ciously observes,      "  That,    in  the   present state of IHerature,
knowledge may be compared to a small portion of gold,
dispersed   throughout a great quantity of ore.                In its rude
condition, the strongest man cannot bear its weight, or
convey it to a distance ; but when the pure metal is sepa
rated from the dross, even a child               may carry it without
difficulty."
    The baronet then         states   what particularly led him to
form on this plan       a work on Health.            The following apo
 logy is given   : —
    "  Though naturally possessed of a sound constitution, un
 tainted by any hereditary disease, yet, about six or seven
years ago, the author had fallen into a weak and enervated
 state, and found himself unequal to the task of managing his
 own private concerns, of prosecuting useful inquiries, or of
 applying his mind to political pursuits, with his former
 energy and 2eal.
    "  As  age advanced, he found many             of his contemporaries
 either   getting    into  a   declined    state,   or sinking into the
 grave, much sooner than he had -expected.                  The causes of
 these events he naturally wished to ascertain, am' to deter
 mine whether so premature a decay might not have been
 prevented.
    "  In carrying on his Statistical Inquiries, (a branch of
 which, namely, the effects of climate, was necessarily con
 nected with the points in question,) it was a matter of as
 tonishment to him to find, how few of the human species,
 in proportion to the numbers born, attained any considerable
  extent of years, even in the healthiest countries.
    " Above all, it was a matter of regret (and the longer one
                                  M,i                                  lives

Jives the more striking it becomes), that even while men do
live, their existence is too often embittered by disease, and
 their life a burden both to themselves and to others.
    " These   circumstances united, naturally directed his atten
 tion to the subjects of Health and Longevity.
    "   He began by endeavouring to procure the re-establish
 ment of his own health, in which, with the assistance of
•some eminent physicians, he has happily succeeded ; in so
much that he is now enabled to take as much mental and
 bodily labour,    as  any person,     it may be presumed, could
 undergo at    Ihis time, who     was born in the year 1754, who
 had fallen into a weak and delicate state, and who had, for
 above thirty    years  past,  been engaged in laborious    and ex
 hausting pursuits.      Indeed, nothing but a complete restora
 tion of health could have induced him to engage in a work
 like  the one which he has now undertaken,         and which must
 necessarily be attended      with no common      degree of fatigue
 and exertion.
    " He    next ventured to give hints to others, whether ad
 vanced in life, or in     a sickly state, how they might secure
 the same advantages which be had derived from his exten
 sive inquiries ; and he has had the satisfaction of receiving
 the most grateful acknowledgments            from various persons,
 in all ranks of life, for the benefits they have received, by
 the adoption of the rules which he recommended.
    " Thus, confirmed in the opinion he had formed of the ad-
 tantages to be obtained from such inquiries, he was at last
 induced to think of a greater and bolder attempt, ' That of
 instructing his fellow-creatures        in general, how they could
 best preserve their health, and attain a comfortable old age.'
    " If   an ahtient maxim be true, Experientia docet, the
 author has some pretensions to a knowledge of these subjects,
 from his own observation and experience ; and, in the pro
 gress   of the intended publication, he will necessarily detail
 the means by which his own health was restored.             It will
 thence appear, that the preservation and the restoration of
 health depend much on minute and unremitting attentions
 to  clothing, diet, air, exercise, habits, &c. which, taken
 singly, appear even trifling, but when combined, and regu
                                                               larly

larby observed, are                of infinite importance.            Rules, with re
spect       to    these      particulars, he was at considerable pains to
collect from            a   number of intelligent individuals now living,
or lately deceased, as well as from personal observation. He
considers them to be a valuable part of the intended publica
tion,    as several          of    thern are not to be met         with in any work
hitherto printed. Had they been known to him thirty years
ago, his own health would not have suffered as it did, and
many irksome hours would have been avoided.       By the ob
servance of these rules, he is persuaded that men, instead of
living recluse, or weighing their food, measuring their drink,
and the like niceties, may, with moderation and prudence
for their guides, mingle in the usual train of civilized or ar
tificial society, without suffering in their health, or shorten
ing the period of their existence."

   It        justice to Dr. Thornton to state, that in his Phi
        is but
losophy   of  Medicine the very same titles appear; and our
first obligations are therefore to that physician.    The plan
also of this kind of performance was derived from him, and
the merit of such a work rests entirely on the judgment of
the selection,              and    combination        of   the knowledge,              so as to
form  satisfactory performance.

  The public are much indebted to                          Dr. Thornton, who first
chalked out this perfection of literature, which has been imi
tated by two such men as sir John Sinclair in his Code of
Health,      and        Dr. Darwin in his Phytologia.                 It       is but justice
to say, that each                 have    their respective      merits     ;    and,    as   Dr.
Thornton's Extracts                  are designed chiefly for students, that
he has been              less     elaborate     in detail   ;   and what renders his

     of the most eminent writers on the preservaiion of health
     and the prolongation of life, with the correspondences on
     this subject of several of the first medical characters in Eu

     of persons.   The physician already conversant on the sub
     ject from his own library, will not regret to see similar pub
     lications in a similar dress, and assembled.    In the present
     work he will also find much new information for his medi

  they are called ; and when the movement given to them
  does not allow them time enough to separate from each
  other, they show themselves in the state of mixture ; they
 produce the phaenomena of ordinary or mixed electricity.
      "  When they      are caught by the Galvanic apparatus they
 arc    separated   from each other; each is projected towards
 one of the two extremities of the           apparatus. They then
 produce     all the   phenomena     of galvanism.     They produce,
 among other phaenomena,            their own reduction into per
 ceptible gases when we receive them in a vessel full of
 water, where, by the effect of the pressure of the liquid,
 they are constrained to condense :' the oxygenated fluid re
 sumes     the state of oxygen gas; the hydrogenated fluid re
 sumes that of hydrogen gas.            As in friction machines the
 two fluids are always confounded, the condensation of these
 two fluids by the pressure of water produces a mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen gases.
     " All living beings are electrical apparatuses, in the inte
rior of which sometimes the phaenomena of mixed electricity
take place, sometimes the phenomena of doubled electri
city, or galvanism.
     *' When the two electrical fluids, abandoned to their na
tural course, meet with bodies which, have an equal affinity
for one and the other, they give to these bodies, by pene
trating incessantly into them, the magnetical constitution. It
is in this manner they produce, by the help of these bodies,
all the phaenomena        of magnetism.
     "  The oxygenated fluid      is the principle of acid composi

compositions.         These two fluids, by penetrating and press

hand muriatic acid, and on the other hand soda. These
two compositions are also combined by the eficct of the

source of the muriate of soda, with which                the water of the

clairtment d'un, seultt menu principe evidemment demontrS."
    The three first tracts, (No. 1. 2. 3.) beside the common
 fault of wanting new experiments, a complete and instruc
 tive series of which was required by the academical notice,
 contained hypotheses and propositions, either well known,
 erroneous, or ill expressed, and advanced without demonstra
 tion   :  for these reasons, the academy did not think these
 tracts could aspire to the prize.
     The tract No. 4.          is not without   merit  : the author enters
 upon several interesting questions concerning the nature of
 light, in a manner that readily convinces us he is not a
 stranger to the subject            ; but the deficiency of connexion
 and systematic arrangement, which is perceived in the tract,
  and above all the absolute want of new experiments, which
  might lead to new results, or serve as a support to a number
  of hypotheses           advanced    by (he author, and destitute of
  every gpecits of demonstration, would not permit the aca
  demy to adjudge the prize to the memoir, even had there
  been none        of   greater merit.
     As to the last pieces, (No. 5. and No. 6.) the academy has
  found them worthy of particular attention, from the report
  of  the committee appointed to declare the besi qualified per
                                                                 formance.

    formance.      These essays (No. 5 and No. 6.) are agreeable to
    the principal condition   stated in the notice, inasmuch as they
    contain   a  great number    of new experiments on the effects
    and properties   of light, and a judicious application of those
    which, though already known, were repeated whenever they
   appeared    to the author    doubtful.   Both pieces are executed
   upon    a plan wisely conceived, expressed with clearness, and
   arranged in a sufficiently systematic order. On the other hand,
   in each were found some incoherent and contradictory con
    clusions, as also propositions hazarded without sufficient
   proof,    besides  some errors and obscure passages : but as
   these imperfections were overbalanced by researches of great
   merit, the academy, without acceding to every assertion
   of   the authors, have nevertheless thought it their duty to di
   vide the prize between        the authors of No. 5. and No. 6.
   thinking them worthy         of encouragement and honourable
   reward.
       On opening two of       the sealed notes, doctor  Henry Fre
   derick Link, professor of physic at the university of Ros
   tock, was found to be the author of No. 5. and Mr. Plaei-
   dus Heinrick, professor of physic and mathematics to the
   Abbey de St. Emeran, at Ratisbon, the author of No. 6.
  The notes of the remaining tracts were burtit without being
   opened.

       When     the  academy made public        the notice  in which
   the marine department proposed a prize on the question
  concerning the resistance of fluids, they engaged to pub
  lish also the judgment which that department, in conjunc
  tion with the academy, should make on the memoir present
  ed conformably       with this   engagement.     The academy an
  nounce by the present, the receipt of these memoirs : viz.
       No. I . with motto, " Sit modus lasso marls et vlarum
  militiceque."
       No. 2. " Prcestat naturce voce do~eri, quam ingenio suo

       (The last of which came after the term) . None were found
  to satisfy all the conditions of the problem ; but as the tract
 No. 2. exhibits a new theory, which, though not established
                                                                upon

upon grounds sufficiently solid, nor applied to naval archi
tecture in the manner the notice required, yet is preferable,
in some measure, to the theories of Rome, and of don George
Juan    ; agrees  better with experiments than the common
theory, and deserves therefore to be noticed advantageously :
the marine department, to recompense the author for his
trouble and laudable efforts, have decreed to him the prize of
 100 Dutch ducats, and the academy have given their sanc
tion to this decision.       The opening of     the sealed note dis
 covered   the author in the person of Mr. Zacarie Nordmark,
 professor of mathematics in the university of Upsala.               In
 publishing these judgments, and distribution of prizes for
 the year 1806, the academy proposes the following question
 for the present year i 807 '•
     Chemistry teaches us the means of discovering the noxi
 ous qualities of mineral bodies, whereas it is only by em
 piricism that we have learned to distinguish noxious plants
  from those that are not so    ; even the  characteristics by which
  we think ourselves enabled      to determine on the presence or
 absence    of poison in   vegetables    are not always sufficiently
  certain and incontestable.
     The livid colour,   for example, which has rendered many
  plants suspected, is a deceiving sign.           The bur (Arctium
  Lappa) looks dull, and is of a pale colour, yet it is a whole
  some plant ; on the contrary, the laurel (Daphne]        is remark
  able for the beauty   of its flowers    and leaves, yet this is poi
   sonous.    The families of Ranunculus        and   Anemone are     as
  beautiful   as they are    numerous,     they are however for the
   greater part noxious.
      The  same may be said    of  the disagreeable  smell  of plants,
   •which is taken for a diagnostic    of the poisonous quality, and
   which sign is equally uncertain with the preceding.
      The colour of the laurel -is very agreeable, while             the
   orache (Chenopodium vtiluaria), an innocent and even salu
   tary plant, is of a very disagreeable smell. The odour of the
   coriander is disagreeable  to many persons, yet     of a  very salu
   tary nature.
      The umbelliferous plants which grow in damp           and   inun
   dated situations,   have the   reputation   of being poisonous       ;
                                                                    not

  notwithstanding this, the Suine (la Berle) and all its species ;
  the Sison inundatum and salsum; the Phellandrium                  aqua-
  ticum ; the Angelica sylvestris ; the &gopodium podagra-
  riu, plants which thrive in marshes, contain no poison.
      It is plain therefore, that neither the pale colour, disagree
  able smell, or growth in marshy places, can furnish us with
 certain and indisputable signs of the presence of poisonous
  qualities in plants.
     The    pretended    repugnance of animals to pernicious plants
 is evidently as     little infallible.    The division of plants made
 by botanists into classes,        orders, and families, according to
 their nature,     is not more efficient in recognising those that
 are venomous.          To  be convinced      of this, we have only to
 observe, that among the        principal genus of the nightshade, so
 suspected, is found the potatoe (Solanum tuberosum), and also
 capsicum (le Piment des jardins) , which possesses the virtue
of exciting and destroying the pernicious principle in
 narcotic plants.
     In consequence of this want of an exterior and natural
 certain sign, by which noxious plants might be immediatel)-
detected, it would be desirable to find out some easy me
 thod of examining them; such for instance as an Eudiometre,
or any thing that might produce changes in them which
 (like the black colour assumed by mushrooms when they are
boiling) might indicate their noxious qualities, though the
criterion     of poisonous mushrooms is not              yet sufficiently
established.
     "An    easy method is tlierefore required, by winch any in
dividual, not having the least knowledge of botany, may de~                .
tect venomous plants, in a short time, at a small expense ;
and in a manner perfectly decisive."
    The prize is one hundred Dutch ducats ; and the precise
time, after which no memoir can be admitted to the com
petition, is the 1st of July 1808.
    The    academy    invite the learned    of all nations, without   ex
cluding its honorary members and correspondents, to inves

      Some experiments have bten made at Hudson's Bay with
frozen quicksilver; it has been reduced to sheets as thin as
paper, by beating it upon an anvil, wtth a hammer, both at
the same temperature         as  quicksilver.
     On plunging       a mass   of frozen quicksilver into     a glass of
warm       water, the latter was immediately frozen, the glass
was shivered into a thousand pieces, and the quicksilver be
came fluid again.

 XXVITI. Essay upon                the   Art of the Foundry among the An-

  -L HE art of working metals must have had its rise in
 countries where the heat of the sun produces them in abun
 dance.        If the    account given by Philostratusf of a table or
 bas-relief of bronze, which Apollonius found in a temple
 nearTaxilla,         is not exaggerated,         the Indians must have car
 ried this art to the highest possible degree of perfection. We
 there see represented             the combats which Alexander fought
•with    the army         of Porus.        Tho different     metals     were  there
 employed and mixed, so as to form the effect of colours J,
 and this bas-relief might be compared with the finest pic
 tures of Euphranor and Polycletes.                       This kind of mosaic,
work in       metals      cannot be referred          to a more antient date
 than    the days of Alexander ; but the finished manner in
 which     the works of that period are executed, must have been
the result of several centuries               of experience §;     and the abun
dance of metallic substances                 which under      a  burning soil we
often find pure and without mixture,                        must have induced
 the most antient nations to practise the art                    of   the foundry
at an early period.            The     table   of Isis,    the blackish    ground

art of melting metals is very an:ient in India ; but I do not think the monu

of Alexander, but, in addition to this, it was certainly executed by a Grecian

I 94                  Essay    upon the      Art of ihe Foundry
of which            is a mixture     of several metals, and of which all
the designs are pieces              of silver hardened, gives us an idea,
although very imperfect, of a similar work.
   The Assyrians and the Babylonians were                      very dextrous
in casting metals. Seroiramis* ornamented her gardens
with bronze animals of every description ; and in the temple
of Belus were seen statues in gold of Jupiter, Juno, and
Rheafj of an enormous size, and wrought with the ham
mer.   An attempt has been made to throw some doubt upon
the recital of Diodorus J, who relates all these wonders upon
the faith of Ctesias,         whose authority is much questioned :
but       if   we reflect, that in these antient times the gold of all
Asia  was collected in the single city of Babylon; if we be
lieve the Bible §, which says, that from the time of Solo
mon gold became so common in Jerusalem that silver lost
Us value ; that Nebuchadnezzar,    in short, erected a statut
of gold sixty cubits high and six broad in the plain of Dura,
near Babylon     we shall find the report of Diodorus
                       ||,                                no             by
means exaggerated.        may be asked,

                                                        if
rectness reigned in these works   This may be doubted with
                                                 ?
so much the more propriety,                   that the ruins of Persepolis do
not give        a   favourable opinion of the        taste or precision of tht
Asiatics in the arts of design ^.

                                        is
name has been handed down to us in history.    Solomon
brought him from Tyre **, in order to make the works in
bronze which were to decorate the temple of Jerusalem. He
made two columns in bronze, each of them 18 cubits high
(31 feet, taking the
                     cubit at  foot nine inches); with two

  Capitals     of   9 feet      in height,        which   were  surmounted       by
  pomegranates           7  feet  high;     so that each column       was 47 feet
  high in all *.
     But the performance which surpasses all that Herodotus,
  Diodorus and Pausanias relate of the antient workmen,
  was the brazen sea, executed by the above artist.                       Twelve
  oxen, of the natural size, supported an enormous bason 18
  feet in diameter by nine in depth ; it rested upon ten brass
  sockets furnished with wheels, by means of which the whole
 machine could be put in motion.                      Between the oxen there
 were cherubims which supported the edges of the bason.
 The description, given in               the third book of Kings, of all the
 ornaments which adorned this work, proves that this Phoeni
 cian artist had some taste, and that a similar work could
 hardly be executed at present with more elegance f.
     In order to mould and cast this sea of brass, columns, and
 several other works, the king assigned                  to Hiram a plain near
 the Jordan where there was                     plenty of clay: this was the
 only    substance         which was necessary for him           ; in those days
 wax was not used.
     From      the    time    of Homer        J  the scarcity  of iron  was    the
 reason why warlike              nations     refined   upon the improvement
 of  the other metals.            The   wheels     of the chariots upon which
 they fought were cast in bronze; the blades of their swords
 and the points of their spears were of copper, to which they
 knew how to give, bv tempering, such a degree of hardness
that it was equal in every respect to iron.                    But the artificial
casting of statues was only known in Asia Minor ; and
    * The   shafts of  ihese columns were 1.3 cubits in circumference,  and conse
quently 4 cubits, or 7 feet, in diameter ; they are therefore, a: the utmost, not
more than 4 diameters and a half in height. This enormous size does not
answer to any Grecian order; but the columns which have been found in the
Thebaid prove distinctly that Hiram conformed himself to the proportions         of
the Egyptian architecture.
   +. It is astonishing ihat the author of this interesting memoir does not take
notice of the most antient works of the Hebrews: such as the making of the
breastplate of the high priest, the melting of the golden calf; which prove
that the Hebrews had acquired this art while among the Egyptians, where it
was known at a very remote period ; and yet Jvl. Seitz decs not speak of the
Egyptians at all. — Note hi M. Millin.

                  JEjiay    upon tht    Art of the Foundry
Greece, properly so called, was not as yet sufficiently civi
lized to pay any attention to the arts which flow from
luxury.       Homer, who wrote in Asia Minor, could not know
any thing of the buckler of Achilles, except from some mo
dels which must have resembled                   it.    When he describes
 the palace of Alcinous *, he speaks -of two dotrs, one of gold
 and the other of silver, which Vulcan had presented to this
prince.       He places in the same edifice statues of gold repre
 senting young boys holding lighted torches ; hut it is in Asia
he places all this ; and when he describes the palaces of the
 Greek princes, we see plenty of riches, but no imitative
work f.
     It was     From     the Lydians        and   the   Phrygians    that the
 Greeks of Asia        Minor     received    the art  of melting   and work
 ing    in bronze,      as well    as   the   musical instruments       of the
Lydian fashion, and their manufactures.                     The works still
 shown of the time of Herodotus J, at Delphos, are proofs
 of this. According to him, Midas, king of Phrygia, sent
to the Delphic Apollo a throne, probably of bronze, or some
 other precious metal, which was remarkable for workman
 ship   ;  and Gyges, king of Lydia, consecrated to the same
 god     six  goblets of gold weighing thirty talents, and pro
 bably made in the country.               From Asia Minor this art pe
 netrated     into   the islands      of the Ionian       Sea ; and the    first
 founders in metal known by the Greeks were inhabitants of
 the islands of Samos and Chio.
     While Greece        was torn with        factions and intestine wars,
the Etruscans         made    great    progress     in  the  melting   of the
metals.       The most antient         statues   of  these people have their
arms resting on their sides,               like those of the Egyptians §;
which inclines        us to   think    they received their first arts and
their theology from the Egyptians and the Phoenicians, with
whom they traded.               They lived, moreover, in a state of
calmness and tranquillity, which lasted to the time of the

 vered with Etruscan                   images         before the Greeks had produced
 any thing remarkable in the art of the foundry *. In the
 eighth Olympiad, Romulus placed his statue, crowned by
 Victory, upon a chariot, to which were yoked four bronze
 horses     which had been carried off from the city of Cameriaf.
 It      was an Etruscan performance; and the seven statues of
 the kings of Home, which                             were      still seen in the time                   of
 Pliny      J   upon the      Capitol,          were also cast in bronze by artists
 of this nation.
   -Between the 30th and 40th Olympiad, Rhoecus and Theo-
 dorus practised the art of casting metals with much suc
 cess at Samos § ; but they                       wrought for Asia                 Minor only                ;

brought the arts into Italy, and that the works said to be Etruscan belong to
the autient Grecian style. But the inhabitants of several countries of Italy,
and particularly the Etruscans, preserved and practised the arts lung tune              a
before the Romans paid any attention to them. — A'ote ly M. MMin.

and it is not probable that their works penetrated                                        into Greece
properly so called, because Pausanias assures                                         us, that, al
though no work in bronze had escaped his attention, he had
not found any thing belonging to Theodoras, and that he had
only seen a single statue of Khoecus in the temple of Diana
it   Ephesus, in Asia Minor.
     The European Greeks were                     as yet so             little     advanced        in the
arts, that the conquerors at the Olympic games had not sta
tues assigned them until the 6 1st Olympiad, and they were
then of wood only ; but twenty years afterwards one Cle-
ostenes, an obscure individual,            who had vanquished in the
6Gih Olympiad,               caused himself to be represented in a cha
riot with four bronze horses                         ;   and, not content with en
graving upon it his own name and that of his squire, he
inscribed the names of his horses also.
     It was from this period                that the sacred grove                     of Altis, near
Olympia, was filled with                      a   number                of bronze statues, in
order to do honour to the memory of the conquerors,                                                while

pf this dissertation,
                    I think, however, that some of his assertions are not well
founded.   At first the antients did not                 endeavour, as he says, to bring the
greatest number of figures possible into             a   small space. On the contrary, they
took care not to multiply the figures, that              they might not divide the attention
too much. This      demonstrated by the
                   is                     great number of monuments which
have been handed down to us one of the proofs which may incline us to re

Pindar immortalized           them by his poems *.              In order to di
stinguish themselves, kin»;s, cities, and some rich indivi
duals, who had gained prizes at the Olympic games, caused
themselves to be represented in a car of bronze drawn by
 two or four horses of the same metal.
     This new branch of luxury               exercised      and   favoured the
rising talents      of  the statuaries     : by degrees the art of found
ing     rose to the      highest pefection, and the renown of the
artists far surpassed that of the candidates in the race, or
ihe athletae whom           they   represented.         It will not be extra
neous to enumerate here those who distinguished themselves
in   the art   of making      horses and chariots          of bronze.
Account      of the   celebrated    Sculptors uiho have founded Bronze
                           Horses and Quadrigce.
    The most antient we know                 is Glaucias,      of ^Eginus; h»
flourished in the 72d Olympiad \, and made a car with four
horses, with which Gelon, king of Syracuse, ornamented
the wood of Altis, near Olympia, for having carried off the
prize in the race.
    Onatas of ^Eginus,            and     Calamides,        cotemporaries of
Glaucias, both laboured at a chariot with four horses, which
king Gelon, brother and successor of Hieron, erected at
Olympia for having obtained a similar victory.                       These two
chariots were still in their place at the time of Pausanias,
who wrote in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.
    Polyclctcs I perfected the art invented by Phidias.                     Hil
human statues were almost all placed in such a manner,
that one of the. two feet always supported the whole weight
of   the body,      and the other foot seemed at ease            :  by this im
provement         his works     had     less regularity     and    more grace.
   • Pindar sold his poems at a very high price. One Pjrtlieas having carried
off   the prize of Pancrace at the Nemcan games, his fellow citizens, who
shared his glory, were divided upon the question whether to erect a statue to
the juvenile victor, or to employ the same expense in order to celebrate his
victory by a poem oj Pinr-nr's. The latter alternative was adopted; and
Pindar, highly gratified vu:h this preference, begins his fifth Neaican ode
with expressing his sense of the honour thus conferred upon him.

Nevertheless             all his figures     were robust (quadratae),                      and

   Myron had more invention than Polycletes, and his per
formances had more diversity.     His imagination, however,
was rather displayed in the different attitudes of the body
than in the movements of the mind; he did not express the
passions, and did not know how to make horses any more
than his predecessors:                 We                    of his Diosco-

race      in the Olympic yames, was              the subject of several epi
grams which we find in the                 Greek Anthology §.
  Aristides, a statuary of the 89th Olympiad,                               made some
quadrigae.              Euphranor,     of Corinth,           was   also celebrated            in
this branch of workmanship                   ||.
   Hypatodorus and Aristogiton were statuaries of the Athe
nian        school,       and     contemporaries           with Praxiteles.           They
made the chariot              of Amphiaraus,           in which       we     see     Laton,
his charioteer.              This monument          was in existence         at Delphos
in   the time  of Pausanias.
     Calamis If, contemporary                     with     Praxiteles,      excelled in
moulding            horses   ;    and no person disputed this talent with
him**.              Praxiteles,     on one occasion, made               for this artist
a   leader for one                          Thus Poussin frequently

great fidelity,           and      he observed          it in the minutest detail      *.

cedon on the subject of one of his horses f-     He gave more
roundness   to the forms, and less acuteness to the muscles;
and represented the limbs as more at ease. On comparing his
works with the clumsy and fleshy statues of his predecessors,
we might sav that he has invented new proportions lor the
human body J.     In fact, he made the heads smaller, and the
limbs  more graceful.  By this means his statues appeared
larger; and it was generally said of him, that if the others
had represented men such as they really were, Lysippus
would have raised nature above herself. We may easily
imagine he introduced the same changes in the designs of
his horses, and       his labours of this, description must
                              that
have been superior to any thing seen before his time.

  ornaments       of   the Temple     of Peace, and of the other nume
  rous edifices of that emperor at Rome *. Notwithstanding
  all this,    Greece was not          yet exhausted   ;  at the time      of
  Pliny 3000        statues   were  counted    in the island of Rhodes
  alone, and an equal number in the three cities of Athens,
  Dclphos, and Olympia.
     The instant a stranger arrived at Delphos, the antiquaries
 of   the city presented       themselves    to him   in great numbers,
 for the double purpose of showing him all the wonders of
 art, and of explaining to him the number of inscriptions
 with which they were loaded.
     Plutarch     f  relates, that, being there with some strangers,
 the demonstrator expatiated with so much verbiage upon all
 the inscriptions, that, the day beginning to decline, they re
 quested him to be less prolix, and to dwell upon the most
 important monuments only.
     One of       the   strangers, who seemed to be a connoisseur,
 and    had    a very accurate       eye, was quite astonished at the
 art which         reigned in most of these statues : he was par
 ticularly surprised at the colour and the lustre of the most
 antient monuments, which represented heroes who were vic
 torious by sea. Neither rust nor verdigrise was to be seen
upon them ; but the colour of the bronze was blueish, and
resembled the element which was the theatre of their ex
ploits.     Of what mixture of metals did the antients make
use, says he, to produce so fine a colour, joined with so
much brilliance ? The dialogue afterwards turned upon
the bronze of Corinth.             It  was agreed that it was nothing
else    than a fortuitous        mixture    occasioned by the burning
of that city at the time of its capture by Mummius; that
the bronze, silver, and gold, melted together, had produced
that composition, which, because the bronze was most abun
dant, retained the name of Cor'ththian bronze; that the gold
and silver mixed produced a paleness which was not very
agreeable to the eye; and, in short, that this blueish colour
of   the bronze       of Dclphos    was the effect of the air which pe-

Naturalists     will soon see if this reasoning, which seems sa
tisfactory to Plutarch aud his contemporaries, can be ad
mitted at present.
     The time of Alexander was the'epoch at which the art of
founding flourished most in Greece.                 The Athenians      erected
to Demetrius Phaleruus, who governed Athens for ten years,
36 i bronze statues, several of which were equestrian, of
accompanied with chariots and horses; and, what appears
 almost incredible, all these works were commenced and
 finished     in the space of 300 days*.                 Lysippus    seems   to
 have exhausted this art, for it fell with him.

         .  CHESELDEN'S observations on this subject, recorded
  in the Phil. Trans. for the year 1728, pointed out iwo ma
  terial facts ; that vision alone gives no idea of the figure of
  objects, or their distance from the eye, since a very intelli
  gent boy, 13 years of age, upon recovering his sight was
  unable to distinguish the outline of any thins; placed before
  him,     and thought that every object touched his eye.
      Mr. Ware's       cases,   which     liave also     a place  in the Phil.
  Trans. for 180i,        and arc compared with 'hat of Mr. Chesel-
   den, appear to lead to a different conclusion.                 The follow
   ing observations are laid b-.-tore the society with a view to ex
   plain this circumstance.

 204       .              Account      of two Children
 account       of his mother,        existed at the time   of birth.     From
earliest infancy he never stretched out his hand to catch at
any thing, nor were his eyes directed to objects placed before
him, but rolled about in a very unusual manner, although
in other respects he was a lively child. The eyes were not
examined till he was six months old, and at that time the
cataracts       were   as distinct     as when he was received into the
hospital .
   Previous to an. operation being performed, the following
circumstances were ascertained respecting his vision.    He
could distinguish light from darkness, and the light of the
sun from that of fire or candles : he said it was redder, and
more pleasant to look at, but lightning made a still stronger
impression on his eyes.   All these different lights he called
red. The sun appeared to him the size of his hat. The
candle flame was larger than his finger, and smaller than his
arm.  When he looked at the sun he said it appeared to
touch his eye.  When a lighted candle was placed before
him both nis eyes were directed towards and moved to   it,
gether.         When    it  was at any nearer distance than 12 inch
es, he said      it    touched his eyes.    When moved further off
he said    it   did not touch them      ;   and at 22 inches   it   became   in-
Visible.
   On the 21st of July the operation of extracting the cry
stalline lens was performed on the left eye. The capsule of
the lens was so very strong as to require some force to pe
netrate it. When wounded, the contents, which were fluid,
rushed out with great violence. Light became very distress
ing to hrs eye, and gave him pain.- After allowing the
eye-lids to remain closed for  few minutes, and then open
                                        a
ing them, the pupil appeared clear, but he could not bear
exposure to light. On myasking him what he had seen, he
said, "Your head, which seemed to touch my eye:" but he
could not tell its shape.            He went    to bed, and took an opi
ate draught      :   the pain   in   his eye lasted abqpt an hour,       after
which      he fell asleep.      The whole of that        day the light was
distressing to his eye, so that he could not bear the least ex
posure to it.
  On the 22d the eye-lids were opened to examine the eye.
                                                                         The

               born with. Cataracts in their Eyes.                205
The light   was less offensive.    He   said he saw my head,   which
touched his eye.       There was so much inflammation on the
eye-hall,   that  a  leech   was applied to the temple, and the
common means for removing inflammation were used.
   On the 23d the eye was less inflamed, and he could bear
a weak light.     The pupil    was  of  an irregular figure, and the
wounded cornea had not united          with  a smooth surface.     He
said   he could    see several gentlemen round        him, but could
not describe their figure.       My face, while     I was looking at
his eye, he said was round and red.
    On the 25th the inflammation had subsided, but on the
27th returned, and continued, notwithstanding                different
means were employed for its removal, till the 1st of August,
when'it was almost entirely gone. On the 4th the e>e was
apparently so well that an attempt was made in the presence
of Mr. Gavendish and Dr. Wollaston to ascertain its pow
ers of vision ; but it was so weak that it became necessary
to shade the glare of light by hanging a white cloth before
the window.         The least exertion fatigued the eye, and
the cicatrix    on the cornea,       to which    the iris had become
 attached, drew it down so         as considerably to diminish the
 pupil.    From   these   circumstances      nothing could be satis
 factorily made out respecting the boy's vision. On the 1 1th
 a second   attempt was made in the presence of Mr. Caven
 dish,   but the pupil continued so contracted and irregular,
 and the eye so imperfect     in its powers, that it became neces
 sary  a second time to postpone any ."xperiments.
    On the 16th of September the right eye was couched.
This operation was preferred after what had happened to the
 other eye, in the hope that there would not be the same de
 gree of inflammation,      and as the former cataract was fluid,
 there was every, reason to believe that couching would in this
 instance be most efficacious.
    The operation gave pain, and the light was so distressing
 to his eye that the lids were closed as soon as it was over,
 and he was put to bed.        The consequent inflammation was
 not severe; but    as soon  as the  fluid cataract, which had been
 diffused through the aqueous humour was absorbed, the cap
                                                                   sule

 206                  Account        of two Children
sule   of   the lens was found to be opaque, and the sight con
sequently imperfect.     The eyes were not examined with re
spect to their vision till the 1 3th' of October, during which
period the boy remained quiet in the hospital.    ,On that day
the upper part of the pupil of the left eye had in some mea
sure recovered its natural state, and had become transpa
rent, but the cicatrix in the cornea was more extensively
opaque than before. The light now was not distressing to
either eye, and when strong, he could readily discern a
white,   red, or yellow colour, particularly when bright and
ebining.    The sun and other objects did not now seem to
touch his eyes as before, they appeared to be at a short di
stance from him. The eye which had been couched had
the most distinct vision of the two, but in both it was im
perfect.     The distance      at   which      he saw best was five inches.
  When       the object was     of    a bright colour,       and illuminated
by a strong light, he could make out that it was flat and
broad ; and when one corner of a square substance was
pointed out to him, he saw             it,
                             and could find out the other,
which was      at the end      of     the    game side, but could not do
this under less favourable circumstances.                    When   the four
corners of   white card were pointed out, and he had exa
              a
mined them, he seemed to know them       but when the op :
posite surface of the  same  card, which  was yellow, was
placed before him, he could not tell whether    had corners   it
or not, so that  he had not acquired any correct knowledge
of them, since he corld not apply     to the next coloured

outline of which the eye had just been taught to trace.
                                    Case     II.
  John Salter,      seven     years    of    age,    was admitted   into St;
George's Hospital on the 1st of October, 1806, under my
care, with cataracts in both eyes, which according to the-
accounts of his relations had existed from his birth.
  After                  into the hospital, the following cir-
            he was received
                                                                               •
cumstances were ascertained respecting his vision.    The pu
pils contracted considerably    when     lighted  candle

                                                                     placed

placed before him, and dilated as soon as it was withdrawn.
He was capable of distinguishing colours with tolerable ac
curacy, particularly the more bright and vivid ones.
  On the 6th of October the left eye was couched. This
operation was preferred to extraction, from a belief that the
cataracts were not solid, and as the injury done to the cap
sule by the operation would be less, there was not the same
chance of inflammation,            the disposition for         which         had been
so strong in the former case.             As   not irritable,
                                               the eye was
and was likely to be but little disturbed by this operation,
every thing was previously got ready for ascertaining his
knowledge of objects, as soon as the operation was over,
should the circumstances prove favourable.    The operation
was attended with success, and gave very little pain.  The
eye was allowed ten minutes to recover itself            round piece
                                                               :    a
of card of  a yellow colour,          one inch in diameter, was then
placed about  six inches from it. He said immediately that
it was yellow, and on being asked its shape, said,   Let me                  "
          it, it,
touch     and    will
                    I tell you." Being told that he must not
touch    after looking for some time, he said   was round.         it
A square blue card, nearly the same size, being put before
him, he said      was blue and round.
                      it                 A triangular piece
he also called round.            The different colours of                the objects
placed before him he instantly decided on with great correct
ness,   but had no idea of their form.                   He   moved          his eye to
different distances, and seemed to             see   best at       6    or   7  inches.
His focal distance          has been since ascertained             to be     7   inches.
He   was asked whether the          object seemed to touch his eye,
he said     ." No    ;"    but when desired to say at what distance                    it
was, he could not tell.             These experiments were made in
the theatre of the hospital, in which the operation was per
formed, before the surgeons and all the students.      He was
highly delighted with the pleasure of seeing, and t'uid   was                     it
" so    pretty,"      even when no object was before him, only the
light upon his   eye.  The eye was covered, and he was put
to bed, and told to keep himself quiet  but upon the house-

surgeon going to him half an hour afterwards, his eye was
found uncovered, and he was               looking         at his bed curtains,
which. were close drawn.            The   bandage        was replaced, but so
                                                                             delighted

208                        Account        of two Children
delighted was the boy with seeing, that he again immedi
ately removed it. This circumstance distressed the house-
surgeon, who had been directed to prevent him From look
ing at any thing till the next day, when the experiment was
to be repeated.  Finding that he could not enforce his in
structions, he thought it most adviseable to repeat the ex
periment about two hours after the operation.    At first the
boy called the different cards round ; but upon being shown
a square,      and asked       if   he could find any corners to     it,   he was
very desirous of touching it. This being refused, he exa
mined     for some time, and said at last that he had found
          it                                                                    a
corner,       and then readily counted the four corners of the
square    ;   and afterwards when   triangle was shown him, he
                                            a
counted the corners in the same way; but in doing so his eye
went along the edge from corner to corner, naming them as
he went along.
  Next day, when          I     saw   him,   he told me he had seen        "   the
soldiers with their fifes and pretty things." The guards in
the morning had marched past the hospital with their band;
on hearing the music he had got out of bed, and gone to
the window   to look at them.   Seeing the bright barrels of
the musqutts, he must in his mind have connected them
with the sounds which he heard, and mistaken them for mu
sical instruments.             On examining         the eye 24 hours after the
operation, the pupil was found to be clear. A pair of scis
sors was shown him, and he said     was    knife.
                                                itOn being a
told he was wrong, he could not make them out; but the
moment he touched them he said they were scissors, and
seemed delighted with the discovery. On being shown                             a
guinea at the distance of 15 inches from his eye, he said                      it
was seven shilling piece, but placing
      a                                 about   inches from
                                                      it       5
his eye, he knew    to be guinea and made the same mis
                         it           a         ;
take,   as     lien   as the   experiment was repeated.
   From this time he was consequently improving himself                         by
looking at, and examining with his hands, every thing with
in his reach, but he frequently forgot what he had learnt.
On the 10th saw him again, and
                 I                  told him his eye was so
                                                I
well that he might go about as he pleased without leaving
the room.   He immediately went to the window, and called
                                                                            out,

 out, '«  What is that moving?" I asked him what he thought
 it was  ?  He said, " A dog drawing a wheelbarrow.              There
 is ont", two, thre,- dogs drawing another.           How very pret
 ty  !" These proved to be     carts and  horses  on  the  road, which
 he saw from a two pair of stairs window.
    On the I9th, the different coloured pieces of card were
 separately  placed before his eye,      aod so little had he gained
 in thirteen days, that he could not without counting their
 corners one by one tell their shape.         This he did with great
 facility, running his   eye   quickly along the outline, so that it
was evident he was         still learning, just as a child learns to
read.      He had got so far as to know the angles, when they
were placed before him, and to count the number belonging
 to any one object.
    The reason of his making so slow a progress was, that
 these figures had never been subjected to examination by
touch, and were unlike any thing he was accustomed to see.
    He had got so much the habit of assisting his eyes with his
hands, that nothing but holding them could keep them from
                                                         *
 the object.
    On the 26th the experiments were again repeated on the
couched eye, to ascertain the degree of improvement which
had been made. It was now found that the boy, on looking
at any one    of the cards   in  a  good light,  could tell the form
nearly as readily as the colour.
    From these two cases the following conclusions may be
drawn :
    That, where     the eye before     the cataract is removed, has
only been capable of discerning light, without being able to
distinguish colours, objects after its removal will seem to
touch     the eye, and there will be no knowledge of their
outline; which confirms the observations made by Mr. Che-
selden   :
    That where the eye has previously distinguished colours,
there must also be an imperfect knowledge ot distances, but
not of outline, which however will afterwards be very soon
acquired, as happened in Mr. Ware's cases.             This is proved
by the history of the first boy in the present paper, who be
fore the operation, had no knowledge of colours or distances,

     Inpractical view, these cases confirm every thing, that

                                 by

          I
the red, green, and violet rays, which      suppose to be the      I

Icould likewise conceive them transformed into coloured
matters of such intensity, or condensation, that the mix
ture of an equal                quantity of each should produce exactly
white.

    Tn the second place     I drew Fig.     2.    This consists of three
curves nearly circular and       alike, described round the dial in
the following manner.          I first described three equal circles,
having their centres in the radii drawn through the divisions
of 60, ISO,      aud   300 degrees; and the circumferences of
which were      targents to the dial at the divisions of 2^0, 3QO
and 120 degrees respectively. I then modified each circum
ference by this law, that, on prolongine the diameters of
the dial in every possible direction, the sum of the prolon
gations of every diameter to the new curve should be a con
stant quantity.       It is easy to understand this second con
struction,     by which it will appear, that the resulting curve
differs in fact little from the circular circumference.
    Thirdly, I conceived, that all the prolongations of the
radii    of  the dial to the red      curve represented      each a pro
portional quantity of my        red matter mentioned        in the para
 graph before the precedine; ;       so that this dial is surrounded
 by a red crescent to a certain point, whence it decreases ac
 cording to a given law.        We must likewise admit a greea
 envelop, analogous to the preceding, and limited by the
 curve of that colour; and lastly a violet envelop, within tlie
 third curve.
     This supposed, if for each point of the dial we make a
 mixture of colours corresponding to that point, we shall
 have a series of tints in imperceptible gradation from one to
 the other; which       in tone, place, and every other respect,
 will   be extremely analogous to the colours           of the dial, that
 I  had previously traced conformably           to the ideas of Newton,
 and are such, that the union            of two diametrically opposite
 to each other, will every where form             a white identically the
  same.
     This is    a result which I offer as a further probability
  greatly   in favour  of my hypothesis of three colours.
     It is true, the dial constructed by the first method differs
  a. little  from that by the last, as in this the purest red is
  somewhat nearer       the place    of the orange,       and   the  violet
  nearer that of the indigo.         But, beside that this difference
  is little in itself, it is supported by experience ; for the re
  lation of colours in general, and the progress of their ab-

sorption,       appear    to   give some preference to         the   latter
method.
    Still I must repeat, that the observations I have here
made are only to show the possibility of the thing ; the
question can he decided only by the direct examination of
the rays of light on the spectrum in its simplest state, and
this remains for me to give.
   As few have the means of procuring this very simple
spectrum, and there is some difficulty in applying them,                    I'
shall enter into this subject somewhat at large. This I con
ceive     to be the     more necessary, as few. appear to have re
peated experiments of this kind since Newton, at least with
due precision.         Treatises on optics indeed do not mention
this repetition formally, many philosophers having attempted
it without success, and others having persuaded themselves
a little to.j hasty, that they had completely succeeded ; as
Abbe Nollet, for instance, whose name                 has been quoted as
an authority.
    I   should not myself have had the means I long wished,
but from the politeness and enlightened assistance of Mr.
Tremery. Fortunately his study was provided with every
thing     necessary   ;  but   I shall first briefly describe the nature
of    the    experiment,      and the conditions indispensably re
quisite.
    The business was to repeat the experiment, in which
Newton obtained a well defined solar spectrum, the breadth
of which, by concentrating the pencil of light, was reduced
to tjL, or 7%. of its length ; and which consequently exhi
bited the hoinogeneal rays incomparably more distinct from
each other than in the common spectrum.                      Opt. Book I.

 a considerable dispersion of the coloured rays ; and 3dly.
in receiving their          dissected   image on a plane very      C.    "f
from the point of the angle of dispersion.
    But these three conditions are not of               themselves    suffi
 cient.     It is almost impracticable to attain the desired object

by the'r concurrence, when the rays arrive at first it) parallel
directions ; still more if they arrive diverging, as they do
when a pencil of light is admitted through a simple hole in
the window-shutter of         a dark room    ;  in whicrrcase   the sen
sible diameter      of  the sun's disk must occasion a divergence
of    the" pencil.    There is only one circumstance favourable
therefore, that in which the rays may be rendered conver
gent, without infringing the preceding conditions.
     The only method of doing this did not escape the sagacity
of Newton. Fie effected it by placing at a considerable
distance from the shutter, and but           a little before the prism,
a   lens  of  a long focus,     which by its position regulated the
distance of the plane on which the spectrum was to be re
ceived.      In this way, and by the assistance of some other
precautions,      he resolved   this grand probletn in optics.
     The following     is the manner    in which we proceeded, and
its results.
     It is not easy to procure a single lens, that shall be ca
pable of giving a focus of ten or eleven feet in the position
in which Newton employed it; for several glasses of little
curvature,      that were lent me      as  fit for the purpose,, were
altogether incapable of effecting it.          I then imagined, that
I might succeed by placing near the shutter an object glass
of short focus, to make the pencil very divergent bovond
it;    and   placing at the same time at a sufficient distance,
an excellent lens of Mr. Trcmery's of five feet focus.
     The effect answered our wishes, and in consequence we
 arranged our apparatus as follows : 1, on the outside of the
 windows, a plane metallic speculum, to reflect the solar
 image: 2, an object glass of 87 centimetres (33 inches)
 focus,     distant from the speculum about 24 centimetres
  (9, 36 inches) : 3, a diaphragm, pierced with a hole six
 millimetres in diameter (2'36 lines,) and at the distance of
  II   centimetres (4- 3 inches) from the object glass, to in
 troduce the pencil of light into the room : 4, a lens of 162
  centimetres (5 feet, 3 inches focus), placed 32 centimetres
  (1 foot)v from the object glass     :   5, at    11 centimetres    (4.3
 inches) from the lens a prism          of very clear flint glass,   wiili
 angles    of 60°, covered with black paper on            each side,   ex-

prism being continued so as to be movcable in different
directions, as occasion might require : 6, a board covered
with white cloth, at the distance of 422 centimetres (13
feet, 8 inches) from the lens.  All these were placed, kept,
or brought into the proper directions, suited to their several
purposes, and to the course of the sun. The place loo wag

Having taken every possible care in arranging our appa
ratus, we were able to obtain every day, when it was fine
weather,          simple spectrum for several hours ; which
                 a very
was quite sufficient for our various experiments, at some of
which Messrs. Berthollet,             the father and son,       Mr. Laplace,
and other gentlemen were present.                >
      The spectrum         was          bounded by two rec
                                  very distinctly
tilinear, and perfectly parallel sides.  Its length was a little
more than 24 centimetres (o. 36 inches)        Its breadth was
•fa   of its length, when           the aperture     in the diaphragm          was
6 millimetres (2. 34 lines). Sometimes this was reduced one
half,                      of the spectrum was proportional,
           and the contraction
the breadth then not being more than -J7; and lastly, by
diminishing the aperture, it was reduced to -J7 of the length.
      As   to    the strength of the colours,        they were vivid and
bright    might be expected.
            as                                 The impression on the eye
was such, on account of the narrowness of the image,, that
at a few metres (two thirds of a foot) from the cloth the
spectrum               two straight lines, forming a small'
                 appeared    as
angle, the apex of which was at the red extremity, and the
base at the violet.  On going nearer it appeared a single
line. It was the same, if the spectrum were examined
from a distance through a glass. This doubling or radiating
of the image depends on the conformation of the eye, and
is connected with some other phenomena, of which I may
hereafter give an account.
  The distinction of the colours,       and their separation into
seven      classes,   was likewise one of the objects of our in-
quiry.  Though the existence of this distinction was per
ceived, it must be confessed, that it was not easy to trace
al) their divisions.         I    made some attempts to         cifcct   it,   the
                                                                     narrative

  narrative of which         I shall pass over for the present ; merely
 observing, that Newton did not make his division on a
 spectrum thus narrowed, but on one much larger, obtained
 in the usual way without a lens. Opt. I, part 2, prob. I.
    Lastly I shall observe, that the green colour in our spec
 trum did not extend quite to the middle of its length, whence
 it   followed, that the shades between the green and red
 were     a   little shortened, and those         of  the   blue and violet
 proportionally         elongated.      These effects were owing no
 doubt to the nature of the flint trlass, of which our prism
 was made.           We had no opportunity of procuring common
 glass     free    from    streaks.    Having tried       a  hollow  prism,
 formed of glasses joined together, and filled with water ;
 the faces of the glasses occasioned duplications of the spec
 trum, which rendered it confused ; so that we returned to
 our English flint glass, which, while perfectly void of
 colour,      combined homogeneity of substance, and accuracy
 of   structure, with the finest polish ; in short it was to all
 appearance        free from defect.
    It now remains for            me    to speak    of  the particular ex
 periments        on the analysis of colours,          which I had long
 planned.
    The     reader     may recollect,     that I had suspected the blue
to be merelv the result          of  a combination of green and violet
rays;     and     that   in like manner the yellow proceeded only
 from    a   mixture of green and red.           1 reasoned    then in this
manner:         on the supposition that in reality there existed no
simple rays of blue, if we prevent the arrival of rays to
that part of the spectrum, either by a substance that suffers
only the green rays to pass, or by one that allows a passage
to the violet only, we shall find beyond these substances
only green or violet; otherwise, supposing the blue rays to
be simple,         they will traverse neither of the substances I
have mentioned,           as we shall (hid beyond them nothing but
black.        We may reason in a .similar way with respect to
the yellow, which must he subjected to the tiial of a red
substance and a green.
    Thus we must be furnished with three substances coloured
in   the    requisite manner.          For the violet I employed         an
                                    0   4                       ammoniacal

ammoniacal       solution    of copper, in      a   phial    with    plane
parallel surfaces : for the green a solution of                muriat of
copper, in a similar phial : and for the red, either wine of
a good colour, or a tincture of cochineal.              All these must
be   sufficiently   concentrated,     or they will transmit other
rays, besides those we have in view.               This concentration
has the inconvenience of rendering          the  colour    obscure, it is
true, and this is some obstacle to their use             ;  but it is the
only way in which           nature   permits us      to  obtain    simple
colours,    and we must be content with it.
   .Coloured    glasses  might be substituted for the red and
green   liquors;   but  with   respect to the violet I could not
procure any, on which I could depend.
   Every thing being thus prepared, I made my experiments
in concert with Mr. Tremery and Mr. Drappier.
    We   had a screen ,     which we could p.at-e        at   will before
the cloth opposite the place of the spectrum.              In this  screen
was a small circular hole        3 or 4 millimetres     (I.   17  or I. 56
line) in diameter, by means of which we could allow a
small coloured pencil to fall on the cloth, while. all the rest
was dark.       We could easily ascertain,      that this little pencil,
taken successively from the different colours, was simplified
as   much as possible by refraction; for the circular spot,
examined some distance with a prism,                was    not at all ir
regular.
   We    then passed through the small         hole a' pencil of very
decided blue ; and in this respect our latitude of choice was
great, since in our spectrum the blue had an extent of more
than   M   millimetres    (2 inches).     The blue spot being well
formed on the cloth,       the green phial was placed before the.
hole ; when the light of the spot was immediately much
weakened, and its colour changed to green. On substituting
the violet phial in the place       of the greeny-the spot became
violet.    This experiment       was  repeated    several    times, that
we might      convince     ourselves   of  the   fact, and     succeeded
uniformly.
   The trial with      the   yellow succeeded      in like manner      ; it
was changed successively to red and green, according to the
substance opposed to the rays.
                                                                 Another

                    On the Decomposition      of Light.              217
     Another    day    these  experiments were repeated with some
 little alterations.      When the small round image fell upon
 the cloth, we went behind to look at it; and found that it
 passed through,       appearing on the back of the cloth, which
 was muslin well stiffened       .vitli starch. In this way we could
 make our experiments more conveniently, as we had only to
 cover our eye with a coloured substance, and look at the
 little spot through it.        When the spot was formed by blue
 light, it appeared green, or violet, according to the sub
 stance interposed.         Through a red substance no light was
 seen   : a proof, that the preceding effect did not arise from
 white light mixed with blue.           If it were viewed through an
 orange glass, the property of which is to absorb only the
 blue and the violet rays, the spot appeared green ; a proof
 that it was formed in reality by green and violet rays.
     Finally,   the   yellow spot exhibited similar appearances;
 altogether invisible through a violet substance, it showed
 itself green or red through substances of these colours.
     Such    are the    results, that confirm      my opinion of the
 elementary parts of light.         Now let these be comb ned with
 the effects   of absorption, which ultimately leaves only red,
'green, or violet rays; with the simple and natural explana
 tion of the principal appearances of the spectrum, by
 means of three kinds of rays ; with the happy manner in
 which these three kinds are applicable to the properties of
 the dial of colours, and remove its complication ; and                 I
 think the whole will support my proposition.              If it do not
 hence appear to the natural philosopher as a fact established
 beyond all question, at least he cannot refuse to consider it
 as already grounded on strong probabilities,           and sufficiently
 interesting     to  merit a thorough investigation, which my
 occupations have prevented me from pursuing any further.
                              Recapitulation.
     Thus our      system    of colours    appears  to  me   reduced   to
 these    few data: three sorts of luminous rays, of a parti
 cular and unknown nature ; red, green, and violet.               Com
 bined by twos, the red and green produce yellow; the
                                                                   green

green and violet, blue; the violet and red, purple: the
three together produce white; and lastly, the intermediate
shades are according to the proportional quantities of their
elements.
      Bodies exercise         a general          action on all the rays of light,
and        a particular       (\ne relative        to their peculiar nature.          If
the white   pencil fall obliquely on the surface of a trans
parent body, the rays, as they penetrate        deviate from        it,
their original direction, some more, others less, according
to their         nature.      Here
                             have      true analysis of white
                                        we             a
light, in which            simple elements may be found
                             its three
separate, as well as combined,      in different proportions.
It    thus that refraction exhibits
      is                                series of tints, which
                                                       a
differ, in different bodies, both with respect to their general
deflection,  measured              by
                           its mean quantity, in the relative
dispersion of the rays, and in the particular position of
each colour.
      If the
          affinity of the body for the rays of light, be such
as to absorb some into its own substance,    will be coloured  it                     ;
and will exert           a    preferable  or stronger action on certain
sorts of rays.           In    a   small mass, the body will first absorb
these rays,          to which
                         has preferable affinity
                                   it        a    and,     its         ;         if

ponderance  to one of them,  will  be   mixedit combination,
                                                           a
that will first disappear. The mass of the body being
gradually increased, the destruction of the rays will go
by new mixtures, still progressively the kind least acted

upon will remain the last, and      will necessarily be one of

these three, red, green, or violet; after which no more light
will be transmitted.    Such are the phaenomena of absorp
tion, and its different gradations.
 I   shall give here one of the last results of my experiments,
which might           have created some confusion              had   it   been mixed
with the preceding considerations, yet tends to confirm their
principles.
 I     had an inclination                        light from given
                                    to try whether the                       a
part      of   the   single spectrum, combined with that of another
part chosen for the purpose, would produce white.
                                                                                  To

                  On the Decomposition       of Light.             219
    To carry this into execution, I      placed before the image     of
the spectrum,      received'on the cloth, a screen, by which one
portion was concealed, and another left open. This screen,
however, was perforated by a small hole, through which
passed a ray     of coloured light belonging to that part of the
spectrum     which    was concealed.      Lasily, this little coloured
ray was received on a metallic speculum placed between the
screen and the cloth, and inclined so as to throw it on a
given point of that part of the spectrum which arrived freely
on the cloth.       Thus the colour arising from the mixture of
two rays of light was observed.
     I varied the trial of this apparatus     on different points, the
corresponding      tints of  which  were   diametrically   opposite on
the dial of colours.        In several instances 1 did not obtain a
•white free from all tint    of colour,    because   a certain propor
 tion in the quantity as well as quality of the elements is ne
 cessary; but having carried the little image almost to the
 limit of the green and blue, ii gave a decided and bright
 white when throsvn on the extremity of the red.
     This very remarkable fact adds fresh support to my pro
 position respecting the compound state of the colour in cer
 tain parts of the spectrum, simplified to the utmost.           For, if
 the combination of the three colours I have mentioned be
 necessary    to produce white, as every thing tends to persuade
  us, we must admit the existence of violet in the greenish blue
  with which the experiment was made.
     N. B. It may be necessary to      add, in explanation of fig. 2.
  Plate IV., that the colours of        the three circles are distin
  guished by dotted lines; the red by round and long points
  alternately ; the green by one long point and two round ;
  the violet by one long and three round.

VIII.       On the Relations between the electrical Energies                                 of
                Bodies, and tlicir Chemical Affinities.
jfxs      the chemical attraction between two bodies seems to be
destroyed     by giving one of them an electrical state different
                                                                                  it by
from that which it naturally possesses ; that           bringing            is,
it artificially into   state similar
                             a       to the other, so   may be
increased         by
            exalting its natural energy. Thus, whilst zinc,
one       of
        the most oxidable of the metals,       incapable of            is
combining with oxygen when negatively electrified in the
circuit,       even     by
                         a   feeble power        ;    silver, one of the least oxi
dable, easily unites to when positively electrified
                                   it               and the                        ;
same thing might be said of other metals.
  Among the substances that combine chemically, all those,
the electrical energies of which are well known, exhibit op
posite states   thus, copper and zinc, gold and quicksilver,
                   ;
sulphur and the metals, the acid and alkaline substances,
afford opposite instances and supposing perfect freedom of
                                       ;
motion in their particles or elementary matter, they ought,
according to the principles laid down, to attract each other
in  consequence of their electrical powers.    In the present
state of our knowledge,      would  be useless
                                         it     to attempt to
speculate on the remote cause of the electrical energy, or
the reason why different bodies, after being brought into
contact, should be found differently electrified its relation               ;
to chemical affinity             id,   however, sufficiently evident.                       May
it   not be identical            with      it,   and       an   essential         property        of
maiter?
     The       coated    glass    plates       of Beccaria strongly                  adhere       to
each other when- oppositely charged, and retain their charges
on being separated.    This fact affords  distinct analogy to   a
the subject   different particles in combining must still be
                  ;
supposed to present their peculiar states of energy.
     In   the present early            stage     of   the investigation,              it   would
                                                                                               be

 be improper     to place   unbounded    confidence in this hypo
 thesis ; but it seems naturally to arise from the facts, and to
 coincide with the laws of affinity, so ably developed by
 modern chemists     ;  and the general application   of it may  be
 easily made.
    Supposing two boJies, the particles of which are in dif
 ferent electrical states, and those states sufficiently exalted
 to give them an attractive force superior to the power of
 aggregation, a combination would take place which wo.ild
 be more or less intense according as the energies were more
 or less  perfectly balanced     ; and the change of properties
 would be correspondency proportional.
    This would be the simplest case of chemical union.         But
 different substances have different degrees of the same elec
 trical energy in relation to the same body : thus the different
 acids and alkalies are possessed of different energies with re
 gard to the same inetal; sulphuric acid, for instance, is more
 powerful with lead than muriatic acid, and solution of pot
 ash is more active    with tin than solution of sod i. Such bo
 dies likewise may be in the same state or repellent with re
 gard to each other, as apparently happens in the cases just
 mentioned ; or they may be neutral ; or they may be in op
 posite or attracting states, which last seems to be the con
 dition of sulphur and alkalies that have the same kind of
 energy with regard to metals.
     When two bodies repellent of each other act upon the
 same body with different degrees of the same electrical at-
•tracting  energy, the combination would be determined by
 the degree: and the substance possessing the weakest energy
 would be repelled ; and this principal would afford an ex
 pression of the causes of elective affinity,   and the decompo
 sitions produced in consequence.
     Or where the bodies having different degrees of the same
 energy, with regard to the third body, had likewise differ
 ent energies with regard to each other, there might be such
 a balance  of attractive and repellent powers as to produce a
 triple compound ; and by the extension of this reasoning,
 complicated chemical union may be easily explained.
     Numerical illustrations of these notions might be made
                                                           without

 without difficulty, and they might be applied to all cases of
 chemical action ; but in the present state of the inquiry, a
 great extension        of this hypothetical part of    the subject would
 be premature.
    The    general     idea will, however, afford    an easy explanation
 of  the influence       of affinity by the massts of the acting sub
 stances,     as  elucidated by the experiments of M. Berthollet ;
 for the combined effect of many particles possessing a feeble
 electrical enerery, may be conceived equal or even superior to
 the eticct of      a   few particles possessing a strong electrical
 energy: and the facts mentioned,           page 108, confirm the sup
 position :     for concentrated alkaline lixivia resist the trans
mission of acids by electricity much more powerfully                      than
 weak ones.
    Allow, ng combination           to depend upon the balance of the
natural     electrical 'energies of bodies, it is easy to conceive
 that  a  mea-itire mav be found of the artificial energies, as to
 intensity and quantity produced in the common electrical
machine, or the Voltaic apparatus, capable of destroying
this equilibrium ; and such a measure would enable UF to
make a scale of electrical powers corresponding to degrees of
 affinity.
    In   the    circuit    of  the  Voltaic apparatus, completed by
metallic wives        and water, the strength of the opposite elec
tricities diminish        frdm the points of contact of the wires
 towards the middle point in the water, which is necessarily
neuiral.       In  a    body of writer of considerable length it pro
bably would not be difficult to assign the places in which
 the different neutral compounds yielded to, or resisted, de
composition.           Sulphate of barytes, in all cases that I tried,
required     immediate       contact with the wire : solution of sul
phate    of   potash     exhibited no marks    of decomposition with
the power of         1 50,  when connected in     a circuit of water ten
inches in length, at four inches from the positive point ; but
when placed within two inches, its alkali was slowly repel
led and its acid attracted*.
                                                                 Whenever
   • In this eTpriment, the water was contained in a circular glass bason  tvro

    Whenever         bodies brought by artificial means into a high
 state of opposite electricities are made to restore the equili
 brium, heat and light are the common consequences.                         It is
 perhaps an additional circumstance, in favour of the theory
 to state, that heat and light are likewise the result of all in
 tense    chemical       action.      And    as in   certain forms       of the
 Voltaic battery, where large quantities of electricity of low
 intensity act, heat is produced without light ; so in slow
 combinations there is an increase of temperature without lu
 minous appearance.
    The effect of heat,            in producing      combination,       may be
 easily explained according             to these ideas.      It not only often
 gives more freedom of motion to the ..particles, but in a num
 ber of cases it seems to exalt the electrical energies of bo
 dies  ;  glass, the tourmalin, sulphur, all afford familiar in
 stances    of this last species of energy..
    I heated together an insulated plate of copper and a plate
 of sulphur, and examined their electricities as their tem-
 per^ture became          elevated    :  these  electricities, scarcely sen
 sible at 56° Fahrenheit to the condensing electrometer, be
 came at 100° Fahrenheit capable of affecting the gold leaves
without condensation             ;  they increased     in a still higher^atio
as the sulphur approached towards its point                  of fusion.     At a
little   above this point, as is well known from the experi
ments of the Dutch chemists, the two substances rapidly
combine, and heat and light are evident.
    Similar      effects   may be conceived to occur in the case of
oxygen and hydrogen, which form water, a body apparently
neutral in electrical energy to most other substances : and
we may reasonably conclude that there is the same exalta-
the eighth of an inch in breadth. The saline solution filled a half ounce mea-
aure, and the distance between the solution aud the water, at both points of
communication,      was a quarter of an inch.   I mention these circumstances be
cause  the quantity of fluid and the extent of surface materially influence the
result in trials of this kind. Water included in glass syphons forms a much lest
perfect conducting chain than when diffused upon the surface of fibrous non-
conducting substances of much smaller volume than the diameter of the sy
phons.    I attempted to employ syphons in some of my first experiments ; but
the very great inferiority of effect as compared with that of amianthus made
me altogether relinquish the use    ef them.
                                                                           lion

 tionof power, in all     cases of combustion.       In general, when
  the different energies    are strong an    1 in perfect equilibrium,
 the combination     ought to be      quick,    the heat and   light in
 tense, and the nc\v compound in a neutral state. This would
 seem to be the case in the instance just quoted ; and in the
 circumstances of the union of the strong alkalies and acids,
  But where one energy is feeble and the other strong, all
 the effects must be less vivid ; and the compound, instead
 of being neutral, ought to exhibit        the excess  of  the stronger
 energy.
    This last idea is confirmed by all the experiments which            I
 have be.n able to make on the energies of the saline com^
 pounds with regard to the metals. Nitrate and sulphate of
 potash, muriate of lime, oxymuriate of potash, thoajh re
 peatedly touched upon a large surface by plates of copper
and zinc, give no electrical charge to them ; subcarbonate
of   soda atvi borax,    on the contrary,      gave a slight negative
 charge, and alum and superphosphate of lime             a feeble  posi
 tive charge.
    Should this principle on further inquiry be found to apply
generally, the degree of the electrical energies of bodies;
 ascertained    by means of sensible instruments, will afford nevr
 and useful indications of their composition.
 IX.   On the Mode    of Action     on the  Pile of Folia, with   expe
                        rimental Llucidations.
    The   great tendency   of the attraction of the different che
mical agents, by      the    positive and negative surfaces in the
Voltaic apparatus, seems to be to restore the electrical equi
librium.      In  a Voltaic hattery, composed of copper, zinc,
and solution of muriate of soia, all circulation of the elec
tricity ceases, the equilibrium is restored if copper be brought
in contact with the zinc on both sides : and oxygen and
acids, which are attracted by the positively electrified zinc,
exert similar agencies to the copper, but probably in a
slighter degree, and being capable of combination with the
metal, they produce a momentary equilibrium only.

other, or the substances dissolved in the water, in the Vol

            On some Chemical Agencies               of Electricity.           225
talc and other analogous instruments, seem to he the causes
that disturb the equilibrium, and the chemical changes the
causes that tend to restore the equilibrium               ;   and the   pheno
mena most probably depend on their joint agency.
  In the Voltaic pile of zinc, copper, and solution of mu
riate of soda,           in what has been called its condition of elec
trical tension,          the communicating           of copper
                                                 plates                 and   zinc
arc in opposite electrical            states.   And with regard         to elec
tricities of such very low intensity, water is an insulating
body : every copper-plate consequently produces by induc
tion an increase of positive electricity upon the opposite zinc
plate ; and every zinc plate an increase of negative elec
tricity on the opposite copper-plate : and the intensity in
creases with the number, and the quantity with the extent
of   the series.
     When     a'   communication          is made between the two extreme
points, the          opposite ''electricities tend to annihilate each
other ; and         if the fluid medium could be a substance inca
pable of decomposition, the equilibrium, there is every rea
son to believe, would be restored, and the motion of the
electricity        cease.     But solution    of muriate of soda being
composed of two             series   of elements possessing opposite elec
trical energies, the oxygen and thu acid arc attracted by the
zinc, and the hydrogen and the alkali by the- copper. The
Balance of power is momentary only ; for solution of zinc
is formed, and the hydrogen disengaged.     The negative
energy of the copper and the posiiive energy of the zinc
are consequently again exerted, enfeebled only by the oppo-.
sing energy of the soda in contact with the copper, and the
process   of electromotion continues,    long as th,.: chemical
                                                  as
changes arc capable ot being carried on.
   This theory in sorne measure reconciles the hypothetical
principles of the action of the pile adopted by its illustrious
inventor,      with the opinions concerning the chemical origin
cf   Galvanism,     supported by the greater number of the Bri
tish philosophers,          and it is confirmed and strengthened               liy
many facts and experiments.
   Thus the Voltaic pile of 2O pairs of plates of copper and
zinc exhibits no permanent electromotive power when the

connecting fluid is water free          from air*; for this substance
 does not readily undergo chemical change, and the equili
brium seems to be capable of being permanently restored
through it.      Concentrated sulphuric acid, which is a mucli
more perfect conductor, is equally inefficient, for it has lit
tle action upon zinc, and is itself decomposed only by a
very strong power.           Piles, containing as their fluid element
either pure water or sulphuric acid, will undoubtedly give
single shocks, and this effect is connected with the restora
 tion of the equilibrium disturbed by the energies of the me
 tals; but when their extreme plates are connected there is no
exhibition,     as in usual     cases  of electromotion.       Water con
taining loosely combined              oxygen   is   more    efficient   than
water     containing      common         air, as   it  enables     oxide    of
zinc to be formed more rapidly, and in larger quantities.
Neutrosaline solutions which are at first very active, lose
their energy in proportion as their acid arranges itself on the
side of the zinc, and their alkali on that of the copper;
and    I  have   found the powers of a combination nearly de
 stroyed from this cause very much revived, merely by agi
tating the fluids in the cells and mixing their parts together.
Diluted acids, which are themselves easily decomposed, or
which assist the decomposition of water, are above all other
substances powerful ; for they dissolve the zinc, and furnish
only   a gaseous    product to the negative surface, which is im
mediately disengaged.
    There are other experiments connected with very striking
results, which offer additional reasons for supposing the de
composition of the chemical menstrua essential to the con
tinued electromotion in the pile.
    As when     an electrical discharge is produced by means               of
small metallic surfaces in the Voltaic battery, (the opposite
states being exilted,) sensible heat is the consequence, it
occurred     to me, that      if  the decomposition      of  the chemical
agents was essential       to the balance     of  the opposed      electrici
ties, the effect,    in a saline solution,       of this decomposition,
   * The experiments proving this fact, and the other analogous facts in thii
page, may be seen detailed in Nicholson's Journal, 4to. vol. iv. page 338 and
393 ; and Phil. Mag. vol. x. page 10.
                                                                         and

 and   of    the transfer    of   the alkali to the negative side, and       of
 the acid to the positive side, ought,                 under favourable cir
cumstances,         to be connected with an increase of tempera
 ture.
    I pbiced the gold cones, which have been so often men
tioned, in the circuit of the battery with the power of 100,
I filled them with distilled. water, and connected them by a
 piece   of moistened       asbestus,   about an inch in length and £of
 an inch       diameter    ;  I  provided a small air- thermometer ca
pable     cf being immersed in             the    gold cones, expecting     (if
any) only a very slight change                of temperature ; I introduced
a  drop of solution of sulphate of potash into the positive
cone    :   the   decomposition instantly began : potash passed
rapidly over into the negative cone, heat was immediately
sensible ; and in less than two minutes the water was in a
state   of ebullition.
    I tried the same thing with a solution of nitrate of am
monia, and in this instance the heat rose to such an inten
sity  as to evaporate        all the water in three       or four minutes,
with   a   kind of explosive noise          ;  and at last actual inflamma
tion took place, with the decomposition                   and dissipation of.
the greatest part of the salt*.
    That the       increase     of the'Conductiner power of the water
by the       drop   of  saline    solution had little or nothing to do
with the      effect,  is evident from this circumstance.            I intro
duced     a  quantity of strong lixivium of          potash into the cones,
and likewise concentrated sulphuric acid, separately,                  which
are better       conductors      than   solutions     of  the neutral salts ;
but there was very little sensible effect.
    The     same    principles will apply to all the varieties of the
electrical apparatus, whether containing double or single
plates; and if the ideas developed in the preceding sections
be correct,       one property operating under different modifica
tions is the universal cause of their activity.
   * In tliis process ammonia was rapidly given off from the surface of the
negative cone, and nitrous acid from that of the positive cone, and a white
vapour waa produced by their combination in the atmosphere above the ap
paratus.

X.  On some general Illustrations and Applications of the
       foregoing Facts and Principles, and Conclusion.
   The general      ideas     advanced    in the preceding    pages are
evidently directly in contradiction to the opinion advanced by
Fabroni, and which, in the early stage of the investigation,
appeared extremely probable, namely, that chemical changes
are the primary causes        of   the phenomena    of Galvanism.
   Before the experiments of M. Vclta on the electricity ex
cited by the mere contact of metals were published, 1 had
to  a certain extent adopted this opinion ; but the new facts
immediately proved that another power must necessarily be
concerned ; for it was not possible to refer the electricity
exhibited by the apposition of metallic surfaces to any che
mical alterations, particularly as the effect is more distinct
in  a dry atmosphere, in which even the most oxidable metals
do not change, than in a moist one, in which many metals
undergo chemical alteration.
   Other    facts  likewise      soon occurred demonstrative of the
same thing.       In  the Voltaic combination of diluted nitrous
acid, zinc and copper, as is well known, the side of the
zinc exposed to the acid is positive. But in combinations of
zinc, water and diluted nitric acid, the surface exposed to
the acid is negative; though if the chemical action of the
acid on the zinc had been the cause of the effect,          it ought  to
be the same in both cases.
   In   mere   cases    of chemical change likewise electricity is
never exhibited.        Iron burnt in oxygen gas, properly con
nected with a condensing electrometer, gives no charge to it
during the process. Nitre and charcoal deflagrated in com
munication     with   the same instrument        do not by their agen
cies in the slightest degree affect the gold leaves.          Solid pure
potash and sulphuric acid made to combine in an insulated
platina crucible produce no electrical appearances.              A solid
amalgam of bismuth and a solid amalgam of lead become
fluid when mixed together : the experiment, I find, is con

                                                                  placed

 placed upon a surface             of mercury,     and separated by an insu
 lating body, is found positive, the mercury is negative : the
 effects      are exalted by heating the metals ; but let them be
 k.ept    in contact sufficiently long to amalgamate, and the
 compound gives no signs of electricity.                       I could mention a
 great number of other instances of pure chemical action in
 which I have used all the means in my power to ascertain
 the faet,       and   the result has been constantly the same.                       In
 cases     of   effervescence,       indeed, particularly when accompa
 nied by much heat,             the metallic vessels employed become
 negative, but this is           a  phenomenon         connected with evapo
 ration, the change of stale of a                 body independent of che
 mical change, and is to be referred to a different law*.
     I mentioned the, glass plates of Beecaria as affording a
 parallel to the case of combination in consequence of the
 different electrical states of bodies.             In Guyton de Morveau's
 experiments         on   cohesion,      the   differerent      metals are said to
 have adhered to mercury with a force proportional to their
 chemical affinities. But the other metals have different elec
 trical     energies, or different degrees of the same electrical
 energy with regard to this body ; and in all cases of contact
 of mercurv with another metal, upon a large surface, they
 ought to adhere in consequence of the difference of their
 electrical states, and that with a force proportional to the
 exaltation of those states.               Iron, which M. Guvton found
 slightly adhesive, I find exhibits little positive electricity
    • The            of the capacities of bodies in consequence of the alteration

in their volumes or states of existence by heat. is a continually operating source
of electrical effects; an J, as. I have him eel page 11 7, it of len interferes with the
results of experiments on the electrical energies of bodies as exhibited by con
tact.    It is likewise probably one of the sources of the capricious*results of
experiments of friction, in which the same body, according as its texture is
altered, or its temperature changed, assumes dillVrenl states with regard to
another body, Friction may be considered as a succession of contacts, and
the nntural energies of budics would probably be accurately exhibited bv it,
if the unequal excitation of heat or its unequal communication to the different
surfaces did not interfere by altering unequally their electrical capacities. Of
the elementsof Hint glass, silex is slightly negative with regard to the metals,
the soda is positive ; and in contacts of glasinvith metals 1 find it exhibits the
excess  of   the energy of the alkali : the case, as is well known, is the same in
friction,   the amalgam of the common machine is essential to its powerful ex
citation.

  Tin, zinc, and copper, which adhere much more strongly,
   communicate higher charges to the condensing electrometer.
   I  have had no instrument            sufficiently exact to measure the
  differences    ;  but  it  would    seem   that the adhesion from the
   difference of electrical states must have operated in these
   experiments*,       which       being proportional       to   the    electrical
   energies    are, on the hypothesis          before stated,      proportional
  to the chemical affinities.          How far cohesion in general may
  be influenced or occasioned by this effect             of the difference of
  the electrical energies        of bodies, is a curious question for in
  vestigation.
       Many applications of the general facts and principles to
  the processes of chemistry, both in art and in nature, will
  readily suggest themselves to the philosophical inquirer.
      They offer very easy methods of separating acid and alka
  line matter, when they exist in combination, either together
  or separately, in minerals          ; and the electrical powers          of  de
  composition       may be easily employed in animal and vegetable
  analysis.
       A  piece  of muscular fibre, of two inches long              and half an
  inch in diameter, after being electrified by              the power of 1 5O
   for five days, became perfectly dry and hard, and left onin-
  .cineration no saline matter.            Potash, soda, ammonia, lime,
   and oxide    of iron     were evolved from       it on  the negative      side,
   and the three common mineral acids and the phosphoric acid
'
   were given out on the positive side.
       A laurel leaf treated in the same manner, appeared as if
   it   had  been    exposed      to a heat   of 500° or 600° Fahrenheit,
   and was brown and parched. Green colouring matter, with
   resin, alkali, and lime, appeared in the negative vessel : and
   the positive vessel contained a clear fluid, which had the
   smell of peach blossoms ; and which, when neutralized by
   potash, gave a blue-green precipitate to solution of sulphate
   of iron ; so that it contained vegetable prussic acid.
       A    small plant     of mint, in     a state   of healthy vegetation,
      *  Amalgamation  undoubtedly    must have interfered ; but the general result
   teems to have been distinct.
                                                                              was

 was made the medium           of connection in the battery, its ex
 tremities being in contact wivh pure water ; the process was
 carried on for 10 minutes : potash and lime were found in
 the negatively electrified water, and arid matter in the po
 sitively electrified water, which occasioned a precipitate in
 solutions of muriate of barytcs, nitrate of silver, and muri
 ate  of lime. This plant recovered after the process : but a
 similar one, that had been electrified for four hours with like
results, faded and died*.            The   facts show that the electrical
powers of decomposition act even upon living vegetable
matter ; and there arc some phenomena which seem to
prove that they operate likewise upon living animal systems.
When      the fingers, after having          been carefully washed         with
pure water, are brought in                  contact with this fluid in
the positive part of the circuit, acid matter is rapidly deve
loped, having the characters of a mixture of muriatic, phos
phoric, and sulphuric acids : and if a similar trial be made
in   the negative part, fixed alkaline matter is as               quickly   ex
hibited.
    The   acid and alkaline tastes produced upon the tongue,                  in
Galvanic experiments, seem to depend upon the decompo
sition of the saline matter contained in the living animal sub
stance, and perhaps in the saliva.
•   As acid    and alkaline substances        are capable of being sepa
rated from their combinations            in living systems by electrical
powers, there is every reason to believe that by converse
methods they may be likewise introduced into the animal
ceconomy, or made to pass through the animal organs ; and
the same      thing    may     he supposed      of metallic oxides       ; and
these ideas ought to lead to some new investigations in me
dicine and physiology.
    It is not improbable that the electrical               decomposition     of
   * Seeds, I find, when placed in pure water in ihe positive part of the cir
cuit, germinate much more rapidly than under common circumstances ; but
in the negative part of the circuit they do not germinate at all. Without sup
posing any peculiar ciTects jrom the different electricities which however may
upcrate, the phenomenon may be accounted for frum the saturation of the
water near the positive metallic surface with oxygen, and «f that near the ne
gative surface with hydrogen.

the neutral salts in different cases      may admit of (Economical
uses.    Well burned charcoal        and plumbago, or charcoal and
iron, might      be made the exciting powers ; and such an ar
rangement     if  erected upon an extensive scale, neutrosaline
matter being employed in every series, would, there is every
reason to believe, produca large quantities of acids and al
kalies with very little trouble or expense.
    Ammonia and acids capable of decomposition, undergo
chemical change in the Voltaic circuit only when they are
in very concentrated solution, and in other cases are merely
carried to their particular points of rest. This fact may in
duce us to hope that the new mode           of analysis may    lead us
to the discovery of the true elements of bodies, if the mate
rials acted on be employed in a certain state of concentra
tion, and the electricity be "sufficiently exalted. For if che
mical union be of the nature which           I have ventured to sup
pose, however strong the natural electrical energies of the
elements of bodies may be, yet there is every probability of a
limit to their strength : whereas the powers of our artificial
instruments seem capable of indefinite increase.
   Alterations of electrical equilibrium are continually taking
place in nature ; and it is probable that this influence, in its
faculties of decomposition and transference, considerably
interferes with the chemical alterations occurring in different
parts   of our system.
   The electrical    appearances     which precede earthquakes and
volcanic    eruptions,    and    which   have been described by the
greater    number of observers of these awful events, admit
of very    easy explanation on the       principles   that have been
stated.
   Besides the cases        of  sudden   and   violent change, there
must be constant and tranquil alterations in which electri
city is concerned, produced in various parts of the interior
strata of our globe.
   Where pyritous        strata   and  strata of coal-blende occur,
where the pure metals or the sulphurcts are found in contact
with each other, or any conducting substances, and where
different strata contain different saline menstrua, electricity
must be continually       manifested}   and it is very probable, that
                                                                 many

            On some Chemical Agencies      of Electricity.        233
many mineral formations have been materially influenced, or
even o -casioned by its agencies.
    In an experiment that i made of electrifying a mixed so
lution of muriates of iron, of copper, of tin, and of cobalt,
in a positive vessel, distilled water being in a negative ves
sel, all the four oxides passed along the asbestus, and into
the negative tube, and a yellow metallic crust formed on the
wire,    and tin- oxides arranged themselves       in  a mixed state
round the base of it.
    In another experiment, in which carbonate of copper
was diffused      through water in a state of minute division,
and a negative wire placed in a snjall perforated cube of zeo
lite in the water, green crystals collected round the cube ;
 the particles not being capable of penetrating it.
     By a multiplication of such instances the .'lectrical power
 of transference may be easily conceived to apply to the ex
 planation of some of the principal and most mysterious facts
 in geology.
     And by imagining     a scale   of  feeble powers,     it would  be
 easy tp account for the association      of  the insoluble metallic
 and earthy compounds,        containing acids.         '(
     Natural electricity    has  hitherto been little investigated,
 except in the case of    its evident and powerful concentration
 in the atmosphere,
     Its slow and silent operations in every part of the surface
 will probably be found more immediately and importantly
 connected with the order and ceconomy of nature ; and in
 vestigations on this stfbject can hardly fail to enlighten our
  philosophical systems of the earth ; and may possibly place
 new powers within our reach.

triangles of Portugal.         The Hydrographic Board            at Madrid
has    furnished    several  of them. We there find              a memoir

 several observations       of the moon at the meridian.
     It  remains to recalculate all the observations made in the
 three voyages      of Cook,     because  they have been compared
 with the lunar tables we had at that time, and which were

    In  the spring    of 1804, captain Lewis was directed by the
president of    the  United States to ascend the Missouri to dis
cover the easiest     way of reaching the Pacific ocean *. For
this purpose he left Washington, accompanied by captain
Clark and thirty men, forming a small caravan : they
ascended    the   Missouri    to   within    930    leagues   of its grand
cataracts ; they then traversed          the rocky mountains in the
neighbourhood,        where     they,  were     under the necessity of
wintering, on account of the snow with which these moun
tains were covered; and in one part, extending about twenty
leagues, the snow never melts.               Captain Lewis proceeded
 120 leagues to the navigable part          of    the river   Kooskooske;
from Kooskooske to the south-east branch of the river Co
lumbia, 25 leagues ; from this branch to the bed of the same
river, 50 leagues; and, lastly, they travelled along the river
Columbia to its mouth, being 150 leagues: which gives a
distance of more than 1200 leagues from the mouth of the
Missouri to the Pacific ocean.
    Captain Lewis observed that the tide flowed 30 leagues
up the Columbia ; that is to say, to within two leagues and
a half of its cataracts,     to the place      where it is navigable for
large vessels.     Above this place it is only navigable for ca
noes and flat. bottomed boats.

     M. Dupuis, author of        the grand work      I'Originedes Cultes,

 discussed    thirty antient theogonies ; he has compared the
 constellations of China and of the Indies; and he has made a
 curious planisphere of them. Among the singularities which
 his inquiries have presented to him, we may reckon the ex
 planation of the four rivers of the terrestrial Paradise, which
 are the expressions of the four signs of the zodiac.             Accord
 ing   to Joseph,    the first expresses plenitude, being the part       of
 long days.       The second, being dispersion, answers to the au
  tumnal equinox.         The third, being narrow and rapid, ex
  presses the    short days of winter.          The fourth signifies the
  coming from       the   east;   this  implies the rising of the sun in,

thor has drawn from these comparisons results which are
extremely curious, in-so-far as the antiquity of these various
zodiacs    concerned
            is          among others this important idea,
                             ;
that we ought not to confine ourselves to the observations
which      have been       transmitted to us;             the initial point            of   the
division being more antient, while we have only been able
to .date  from the equinoxes and solstices 4700 years before
           it

   This     gives    him    the explanation              of   the   Indian fables of
the Phoenix, which           is   only       the    period of       1460 years,             and
several other curious points               of erudition.   He     at present
                                                                           is
occupied with his collection               of thirty theogonies, in order to
complete his great work on the origin of the different reli
gions.  He remarks, for example, that Adam and Eve are
the constellations of Charles's wain and of Virgo, each of
which has    serpent, and which are near the autumnal
                 a
equinox.  When Adam rises, Eve seems to follow him, and
she announces the entrance of evil into the world.

distinct  work concerning the Egyptians and Chinese, not
yet printed.  He thinks that the Greeks, for want of being
better acquainted with what the Egyptians taught as to the
course     of nature, formed       a       zodiac   ;    but the names                of    the

     The   losses to science this year from the deaths       of learned
men have not fallen upon astronomers ;              but M. Coulomb,
to whom magnetism lies under great obligations, deserves
our regret, as I have shown in the discourse I pronounced
over his tomb, and which I printed : M. Delambre has also
noticed his death in an elegant manner in the Memoirs of
 the Institute.
     In   the Ephemerides of Milan for ISOG, M. Cesaris has
 '
given the Lite of Francis Reggio, born at Genoa on the 25th
 of April 1743, and who died at Milan on the 12th of Oc
 tober 1804,      whose labours have      illustrated the Milan     ob
servatory for these forty years.        I have often taken occasion
 to speak of the Ephemerides of Milan. M. Reggio has been
 replaced by M. Carlini : M. Flaugergues has published the
 eulogy of M. de Ratte ; M. Vitalis has read to the Academy
 of Rouen that of M. Dulague.
     I forgot to mention in the History of Astronomy for
  1804, George Shuckburgh, of whom I have spoken in my
 Travels through Italy, on account of the altitudes of moun
 tains measured by him in several countries (Phil. Trans.
   1777) ; and also on account of the fine equatorial he caused
 to be constructed upon his estate,           (Astronomie, art. 2410.)
 It   is a great loss to the science  that this instrument must be
 now useless for want of an observer.
     They write from Ratisbon,         of    the  5th  of March, that
 count Sternberg, vice-president of           the  electoral directory,

 lossal statue    of Carrara marble to the celebrated astronomer
  Kepler,    who  died at Ratisbon in 1630, on his way to Vienna.

     The meteorology of this         year has presented some extra
 ordinary    variations   ;   there have  been neither any very great
 heats nor colds, but plenty of tempests.
    -In November 1805 there was an earthquake at Frankfort.
 On the 20th of January 1806 there was a rumbling noise at
 Orgon and the mouths of the Rhone, which awakened the
 inhabitants.      On   the 10th    of January   there  were  storms at
 Bourdeaux,      Brest, Rouen,       Paris, and Ypres.
     On  the  Uth of January there'was         a dreadful storm in the
 neighbourhood of Chartres, Dijon, and Nancy; an extra
 ordinary hurricane at Besancon ; there was a thunder storm
 at Toulouse, and there was an inundation at Rotterdam.
     On  the 20th,    in    the  department of Landes, there were
 some buildings burnt, and some trees torn up by the roots.
     On the 28th there was experienced at Poitiers two shocks
 of an earthquake, accompanied by a prolonged rumbling
noise ; the thunder fell upon the steeple of Cervo, near Sa-
vone, and the steeple of Albisola was thrown down ; it fell
upon the steeple of Bezaudun, near Grasse.                 Thus these
stormy clouds occupied more than a hundred leagues in ex
tent; which confirms the explanation of hurricanes which
I gave in the History of Astronomy for 1805.
    On   the   13th  of March,      at Havre,   Caan, Antwerp, and
Brest, there     were    dreadful hurricanes ; and several ship
wrecks on the coast of Holland.
    On  the 9th   of June     there was   a dreadful hurricane at Sa
lerno.
    M. Blanc,    captain of a corps at Palma Nova, in Venetian
Frioul, observed a singular water-spout, which 1 gave an
account of in the Journal de V Empire of the 22d of August,
and* in the Moniteur of the 23d.
    On  the 2<;th there was a very strong wind          at Nantes  :  at
Paris some chimneys were thrown down, trees were torn up
by the roots, and all the fruits were shaken off.
    In September     there     was a dreadful storm at    Martinique   :
300 persons perished at         Dominica.
                                                                     On

              History of Astronomy     for  the Year 180(5.       941
     On   the  8th of August there was an earthquake upon the
 banks    of the Jenisseick, in Siberia.
     On the 1 1th of December, in the neighbourhood of May-
 enne and Vitrie,       three steeples   were   destroyed by thun
 der: on the     13th it thundered at     Brest: on   the 14th it was
 as  fine a day at Paris as any in spring; the cold commenced
after the moon's passage through the equator.
    M. Lamarck      has published,    for the eighth time, -his Me
 teorological Annuary for 1807      :  he congratulates himself for
having had the courage to devote himself to the study, and
for undertaking the publication of this annuary : at first he
only considered the two alternate declinations of the moon ;
at present he considers the different systems      of the moon's   in
fluence, and the perpetual substitution of the one for the
other.      These different systems change incessantly their re
lations and their effects at every lunar point; the new moon,
apogee, equinoxes,, and solstices, vary on account of the gene
ral disposition of the other points at the epoch at which they
arrive ; and he deduces from this, for every month, proba
bilities for the temperature.
    He has given in the 7th volume, for 1806, an epitome of
his meteorological system, which is only applicable to the
generalities of the atmosphere.-         He gives in the latter the
influences which the general disposition of the lunar points
seems to     him to exercise upon every arriving point ; whence
result for this point modifications which render its action
sometimes efficacious, and sometimes incapable of being
so.
    He has added some memoirs upon easterly and westerly
winds, and upon the difference of phaenomena, upon atmo
spheric electricity, and upon the courses of its variations.
    I   am   desirous that observers     should   examine and ve
rify the principles    and results, which have been perhaps too
much neglected      hitherto.    If there were a great number of
points of observation,       we might succeed in following the
direction of    a wind from its origin, and thereby arrive at its
cause, and follow these variations and effects.
    After having announced all         the good books    which   have

 appeared,   in order that we may read them, it may be useful
 to speak  of those whose titles might deceive us.
    Eisai sur le Monde, by M. Azais, 1806, in 8vo. He
 endeavours    to prove the necessity     of  a first  impulsion ; the
 infinity of  the universe and     light  as the cause     of movement
 by the impulsion of rays, and as the cause of gravitation,
 the impulsion of the stars being greater than that of the
 sun: he read one part of these singular ideas to the Insti
 tute.   The Mouvement      de  la Mature en tout Sens, and the
 Corpuscules ultramondains, with which M. Lesage has been
 busy all his life at Geneva, may serve as a support to the
 system of M. Azais : but scientific men disdain these kinds
 of hypotheses, as being destitute of proof, and not               being
capable   of teaching us any thing.
    M. de Lormel has published supplements to his Grande
 Periode, in order to give new proofs and new applications
 for the six days of the creation and the prophecies of Daniel.
He endeavours to refute what I have already objected to him,
that the diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic cannot
form a period, since it cannot continue according to the
well-known cause of this diminution.
    There   has appeared    a  book,    the title of which      deceived
me, because I never thought of meeting with any thing like
astronomy in it.       It is entitled Howmage a Pius VII. et
Napoleon-lc- Grand, or Junction of Religions           ;   by Alex. Jos.
Guyot, curate of Cambray.           He speaks of      the atmosphere
of the comets;      he thinks he has discovered the size          of  the
stars  : but it may be easily seen thai he confounds            the ap
parent diameter of the stars with the annual parallax, which
can enable us to judge of their distance.             He is persuaded
that he has demonstrated that the sun does not turn round,
because   the moon would      each    day  have all its phases.       He
does not comprehend that, the moon             having    a semi-diurnal
motion    with the sun, it is all one whether this movement
be apparent   or real.
   Thus, all  these astronomical articles prove that he has not
profited by my lectures, at which he says he was present.

  The author first explains all               the known       systems;        he af
terwards gives an astrostatic, in which he asserts that the
sun traverses the ecliptic with a very large circle, and that
the earth traverses the equator with a very small circle. He
rejects all eccentricity, as being contrary to the divine wisdom
of the Creator  ; he is so riveted to these absurdities,   that in
page 256 he says,           when speaking of the mean sun which I
made     use        of for the equation of time : " There is no oc
casion for quoting such an author, but we should turn to
the sacred writings, where every thing is published, and
which has tended more than any other writing to form au
thors for this half century past ; whilst the works of this writer
have been so much filled with the absurdities and errors of
modern    philosophy, that posterity will only preserve some
leaves   of them; that is to say, the notions furnished by arti
sans for the part of the measures."
  In speaking of            the refraction,    which shows             a star at   the
horizon although it is still below he adds    it,
                                              These bur       :    "

it is upon devotional exercises.

 J\    GRADUATION' like that which we have been describing
 is truly natural and invariable ; there is nothing precarious
 in it : in short, let us examine the operation we have de
 scribed.
    We    have,    on the one hand, put into solution one deci
 gramme, that is to say, ten grammes or 100 decigrammes
 of potash ; nevertheless we have only taken definitively the
 moiety of this solution ; thus it is reduced to 100 half-tenths
 of  the grammes       :  on the other hand, we have put into the
 alkali-meter     38 grammes, that is to say, 76 demi-grammes
 of a liquor composed of one part in weight of sulphuric acid
 and of nine similar parts of water : the 76 demi-grammes of
 the test liquor therejore contain 76 demi-tenths of grammes
 of tflcctivt   acid   ;  and,  if it required  55 dtmi-grammes     of this
                                                                    liquor

                     Oa the Alkalies      of  Commerce*                     245
liquor in order       to saturate the proved potash, we are evi
dently     well  founded     in saying that this alkali has absorbed
a quantity of sulphuric acid equal to 55 hundredths of its
weight.
    Each trial, however, is        made  without calculation        ; a single
weight is sufficient,         and the instrument      finishes the rest al
most alone.
     In some countries from which potash             is exported there are
inspectors of this article ; but they have not had, until this
moment, any method of inspection which could be com
pared with that described in this memoir*.
  Alkali-metrical        Trials    of  Sodas, Natron, Tartar Ashes,
                             Tobacco Ashes,     &c.
     It  requires but a very slight modification in this process
to apply it to the trial of sodas ; in place of one decigramme,
i.  e. ten  grammes, we must put about ten and a half, or, if
we please, three drachms, in a middle-sized metal mortar,
and pound them strongly for five minutes, so as to produce
a fine powder, of which we must weigh exactly one deci
gramme, or, what is very near that quantity, two drachms
and     forty-four grains and two-thirds of a grain, which we
afterwards put in the water, as is said above of potash.

            Extraordinary Alkali-metricab Results.
   Great variations are met with in some parts of these arti
cles ; in the pearlashes and potashes, for instance, by the
fraudulent mixture of various foreign salts, the alkaline part
of which, neutralized by the sulphuric and muriatic acids, is
of no use to soap.-makers, dyers, and bleachers : we meet
with variations     also in the sodas by means           of  the addition    of
herbs, other than the salsola and the salicornia at the time
of incineration ; or also in sodas produced by the combustion
of plants before their maturity. For, according to M. Chap-
tal,  the latter is almost entirely muriate without altera
tion. Certain potashes contain also sulphur and charcoal
in Solution . the casks and packages of these alkalies are not
always of the same quality in their different points and va
rious pieces. The two extremities of a cask, and its centre
towards the bung, have been found to contain good potash :
the other parts were of a very inferior quality, or centained
nothing    else   than earth.         Some unprincipled people have
made    a traffic of soda from sea wrack, which they sell in
place of Alicant soda, giving it an exterior appearance by
means of a process, which it would be useless if not cri

  On the other hand, I have in my experiments sometimes
met with extraordinary degrees in point of strength, such as
pearlashes at 66°; American potashes of the first sort at 72°;
and even these potashes, marked second sort, at 66° , and,
lastly, pieces of natron at 6O0. These last had probably been
deprived of all water of crystallization.
Great Utility        of a Method of Graduation for                      the   Alkalies
                             of Commerce.
   It results from the preceding observations, that not only
the consumer of the alkalies of commerce has hitherto only
had very precarious methods of estimating comparatively the
real pecuniary value of what he buys, but also that he is ex
posed to very troublesome inequalities in the result of his
operations,      if he employs, as almost always happens, the
good    and     the bad commodities in equal doses.  Whether
a dyer, for instance, employs soda at 30° or at 15°, he will
be equally exposed to fail in his operations, and consequently
to experience great losses, either from his alkali being weaker
or stronger than usual.
   On extending these reflections, we see that all the arts
which require the consumption of alkalies would consequently
receive a great benefit from the happy innovation which
would be produced in this branch of commerce,         on the              if,
one hand, potashes, sodas, and natron, should become con
stantly homogeneous in the same cask, which would bear                              a
mark indicating its alkaline strength    and     on the other
                                                     ;         if,
hand, we could announce        the prices current that such an
                                      in
alkali, of certain alkali-metrical degree, costs so much the
            a

happy effects    ;    they will       be produced         by   the   spirit of the
first trader who shall          see    the good effects        of it.         We may
conceive,  in fact, what advantage      dealer in this article

chant who could deal in this manner would obtain                        a great
preference, and ultimately others would be induced to pursue
the same course.    I shall now proceed with my detail of the
method of accomplishing this process, beginning with the
                          Graduation         of   Potashes.
  Suppose there are in a storehouse 100 casks of potash,
containing about 400 kilogrammes each : we may give all
of them the same alkaline strength, and may afterwards
ascertain   it,and point   out in
                                it precise manner.
                                              a
  Each of    the casks   opened at one end, and the potash
                            is                                               it
contains    isemptied upon the ground.    We must afterwards
break, with      a   long-handled mallet, all the masses which are
larger than       a    large nut  the whole must then be mixed
                                     ;
equally, which may be done in five minutes    two men              by
furnished with wooden shovels. The potash must be after
wards replaced in the casks, arranging the business so that
the casks, whether full or not, shall contain the same num
ber   of pailfuls ormeasures.    All these casks having been
thus opened, their contents  broken  and mixed up,  common          a
mixture may be once more made of all their contents.
   For this purpose,   place being set apart on the floor of
                            a
the store-room, we must bring, one after another,      pailful          a
of the potash from each barrel alternately   sufficient num:   a
ber of men being furnished with wooden shovels, the whole
mass may be mixed up as exactly as possible. The casks are
afterwards filled and ;          by
                          this means we may ascertain that
their contents have an equal degree of alkaline strength,
which may be proved              by
                          single trial.
                                     a
   This trial must be done with exactitude, and in the fol
 lowing manner we must put about two kilogrammes of the
                      :
 general mixture into   mortar, and pound them until no
                              a
piece  remains larger than    grain of wheat.
                                         a         One deci
gramme    must  then be weighed  exactly, which,  upon  being
subjected to the proof           by
                          the alkali-meter, will indicate the
alkaline strength of the whole potash                 in   the casks.
                                                                             It

  It   is easy to prevent                any loss      of weight in any of the
casks, by care             and  celerity in the manipulation; during
which, in damp              seasons,  a stove should be placed in the
store-room      :    if   this precaution is not adopted, there will be
an increase         of weight.

  It       will not       be difficult         to apply thesS         manipulations           to
soda   :    this article must be first broken by means                          of a piece
of iron, then pounded in mortars, or bruised under                                a   vertical
mill   the stamperof which                 is inserted         in   a wooden axis       :    ttye
soda   in powder must then                 be passed through a metallic sieve
for the convenience                 of   those     who use it.            As soon as the
quantity is procured requisite to fill a given number                           of casks,
we must then proceed to make the general mixture above
described, and pursue the usual method, with the peculiar
modifications applicable to the trials upon soda.)
   As to natron, the         method may be adapted as with
                                    same
potash, with this exception, that, the masses being gene
rally larger and harder, they require a little more time and
 manipulation             than potash.                    '•

   Some people     may be apprehensive that the expense of
 these  manipulations would counterbalance the advantages
 to be derived from them ; but, after having made a gross
 calculation of the expenses of this manipulation upon potash
 and natron,          I found they
                            were very trifling : as to the ex
 penses upon       soda, these
                          the  will be reduced one-half if we
 deduct the expense of pulverization, which      at all events,           is,
 an indispensable requisite with this article.

acid and potash are constantly the same ; so that 100 parts
of sulphuric     acid always displace by their saturation only
forty parts of carbonic acid, when we employ any of the
potashes    of commerce ; while, if   we saturate these same 10O
parts of sulphuric acid by truly neutral carbonate of potash,
we constantly displace 84 parts of carbonic acid. We know
that heat takes from the carbonate of potash only a portion
of its acid ; I am therefore inclined to think that this quan
tity of carbonic acid remaining in the potash of commerce
 is constant, which even the heat of incineration cannot di
 minish; it is probable that, after having exposed carbonate
 of potash to this   degree of heat, we shall find that it has not
 retained either more or less of carbonic acid than the potash
 of commerce, relatively to the alkali-metrical degrees re
 spectively found in these salts.
       Chemists who repeat these experiments will find that
  pearlashes give a less proportion of carbonic acid : it is pro
  bable that this is to be attributed to some circumstances of
  the process during which the ashes or the ley has absorbed
  a little less of the carbonic acid, which is both formed
  during combustion and is found in the atmosphere. This
  slight difference would explain why some manufaciurcrs
  prefer the white potash of Russia to pearlashes. Thus, al
  though a long exposure to the air may increase the propor
  tion of carbonic acid in the potash of commerce, this does
  not prevent us from distinguishing two constant states of
  the carbonate of potash by applying this name to the truly
  neutral carbonate only, and by denominating the potash of
   commerce supersaturated carbonate of potash : this is con
   formable to the principles of the chemical nomenclature, as
   the borax   of commerce with     an excess   of  base has   been
   called supersaturated borate of soda.     I admit that between
   these two states of carbonate of potash and supersaturated
   carbonate of potash we may create intermediate degrees in
   all proportions, when by combining the carbonic acid with
   the latter we stop before having saturated all the alkali.
        Some authors have   designated   as alkaline  carbonate   of
   potash the salt with an excess of base, to which I must call
    the attention of chemists ; but although this denomination
                                                                may

  may seem at first view more natural,         I think   we ought to
  prefer that derived from the principles      of the nomenclature,
  from which we cannot depart without replunging the lan
  guage of chemistry into the confusion from which it has
  been so happily extricated : in fact, the carbonates of potash,
  soda, and ammonia, are alkaline carbonates, however neutral
 they may be : the denomination of alkalescent carbonate is
 not more proper, because thia would indicate a successive
 diminution of the proportion of acid. The salt in question
 cannot therefore be called any thing else than supersatu
 rated carbonate    of potash.
  Uncertainty    of  the Processes  for    the Caustificalion    of the
                               Alkalies.
     I return to the caustification  of the alkalis by lime    :  there
 can be no doubt as to the uncertainty which prevails on this
 subject, even in the most recent treatises in chemistry :            I
 shall quote only one example among all those I might col
 lect.    We   read in the Systems des Connoissances Chimiques,
by M. Fourcroy, sect. iv. art. 10. no. 4, that
                                                        " in order to,
obtain pure potash we must mix it with double its weight of
lime,    and eight or ten times tlie weight of the total mixture
of rain water; we must boil them for two or three hours, filter
and draw       off the clear lixivium, this we must try by lime
water, which it ought not to precipitate ; otherwise we should
again pass it over quicklime."           On the other baud, con
sult sect. v. art. 12. no. 16, and you will find what fol
lows : " we must mix the carbonate of potash with half its
weight of quicklime , upon which it must be strewed." Water
should then be thrown over it in order to slake the lime; it
is afterwards diluted ; it absorbs carbonic acid ; it passes to
the state    of carbonate of lime, which       is insoluble,  and the
potash remains pure and caustic in the liquor."

XXXIV.        Report made to the Class of Physics and Mathe
    matics of I hi- Institute of France, upon a Proposition made
    by   M. Six, Chief Director of          the  Fire-Engines of Paris,
   for substituting Water saturated with Sea Salt instead of
    common Water, far extinguishing                 Fires.       By Messrs.
    CHAPTAL and MONGE*.
J. HE advantages found by              M. Six     by employing the me
thod he proposes are these :
    1.   To  present  a  liquid which never         freezes at the tempe
rature    of our climate.
    2.   To employ    a  liquid more proper than pure water for
extinguishing fires.
    3. To preserve for a longer time the casks, which are
often broken from the water freezing in their insides.
    4. To    preserve the water from all decomposition.
    5. To preserve the casks from the speedy destruction they
suffer from fresh water left in them in a state of rest.
    In order to give a precise idea of the merit of the method
suggested      by M. Six, we think it right to examine the two
following questions :
     1 . At, what degree of cold        does    water freeze when satu
rated with different quantities         of  sea salt ?
     2. Does water saturated          with sea salt attack         and destroy
the leathern pipes        employed in fire-engines ?
     In order to answer the first question, we submitted to a
cold of — 17°of Reaumur, produced by the mixture of pounded
ice and bruised sea salt, some phials filled with a solution of
 sea salt at various degrees of saturation, from two up to
 twenty degrees.
     This experiment was several times repeated, and always
 upon six kilogrammes of ice, with about half that quantity
 of pounded sea salt, and at a temperature of about ten de
 grees.
     We constantly obtained the following results:
      1. The solutions       at  two, three,      and   eight degrees were
 frozen some minutes after their immersion in the mixture.

                                                      tom. i. p. 274.
                                                                          The

 254                Water saturated with Sea Salt
   The solutions     above   No.   12 were more tardy     in freezing.
   When the solution was at 1 6 degrees, the freezing did
 not take place sooner than 40 or 30 minutes.
   In the solutions at 19 or 20 degrees, only some few icicles
are formed around the edges         of the mixture.
   2.   At  a cold of twelve degrees, no solution freezes in a
mass ; all    of them from 2 to 15 degrees are frozen upon the
sides of the phial, and the layer of ice becomes more or less
thick, always in an inverse ratio to the degree of saturation.
The solutions at 19 and 20 degrees never froze at all.
   3. When the mixture of salt and ice is formed, and                 the
thermometer is down at       — 17°,   we may keep up this degree of
cold for two hours at least, provided we slope the vessel so
as to let the water flow out produced by the melting.
   If   we draw out the phials containing the solutions at the
moment the thermometer begins to rise, we observe                as fol
lows :
    1.  The solutions     which     are   below  10 degrees,    present
masses   of ice only without any appearance of water, to such
a degree of cold that these masses when carefully pounded
do not, for some time,          moisten the bodies upon which        the
operation taRes place.
   2. The solutions which mark from 10 to             16 degrees,  pre
sent a soft kind      of ice, which may       be bent,   and is of   the
consistence    of sherbet.
   3. The solutions which mark            18 and 20 degrees,    present
only   some crystals   of ice swimming in        a  limpid liquor,     or
fixed upon the sides of the vessels.
   4. The thawing takes place more speedily in phials, when
the liquor is'at a high degree of saturation, and more slowly
at the    lower   degrees,   in such a manner that it fallows vi
gorously and constantly the scale of saturation.
   5. The icicles separated with care from the portion of
water not frozen, and washed with pure water, present the
following phenomena :
   A. The water issuing         from    their melting   is constantly
salt.
   B. The gravity of      the water proceeding from the crystals
of  the solutions from     1  to 5 degrees,   compared with that of
                                                                    the

                 proposed for extinguishing    Fires.              255
the portion     of the unfrozen solution,        presented    as   fol
lows :
    In a flask containing 36 grammes of pure water, the water
produced by the melting of the crystals No. I weighed 36
grammes 5 decigrammes ; and the water not frozen, and
carefully separated from the ice, weighed 36 grammes 6 de
cigrammes.
    In the same flask, the water proceeding from the melting
of the crystals No. 1 weighed 39 grammes 6 decigrammes ;
and    the  water not frozen        weighed   39 grammes     8   deci
grammes.
    Although the results thus presented arc not all necessary
for answering the proposed question, we have thought it
proper to report them all, in consequence of their appear
ing in opposition in some respects to the ideas hitherto en
tertained as to the freezing of salt water, and as they serve
to clear up the processes followed in some northern districts
for the extraction       of   salt from   sea  water,   and  perhaps
tend to review and verify the theoretical principles        of  freez
ing.
    The second question remaining to be examined, respects
 the injury that may be done to leather pipes by salt water.
    In order to decide this question, they thought it best to be
guided both by experiments and observation.               They were
 informed by M. Bonjour, the director of the national salt
works, that in the salt works of Meurthe they have for se
veral centuries used, for raising the saltwater, pumps in the
cylinders of which round pieces of leather have been fixed ;
 and that notwithstanding the uninterrupted usaga of these
 pumps, and the contact of water saturated at 16 degrees, no
 alteration nor deterioration had taken place which could be
 attributed to the action of this liquid.
     But even  if  it were true, that the saturated solution   of salt
 attacked the leather or rendered it brittle,         yet we do not
 think salt water should be rejected on that account, because
 M. Six with justice observes, that in the present state of the
 service they carefully wash the fire pumps and their pipes as
 soon as they have been used, in order to clear them from
                                                                    any

   any impurities that may be deposited by the muddy waters         of
   rivers, or the putrid water from casks.
       Salt water, therefore, will not require any new precautions
   on the part of the firemen, and the leather of the pipes will
   not be moistened with it long enough to injure them. The
   reporters    therefore are  of opinion that the suggestions of
   M. Six    present real advantages, and deserve to be adopted.

      March to the End of June 1807: with Remarks on the
      Propriety of establishing a Fund for the Relief of the
      Ruptured Poor. By JOHN TAUNTON, Esq.
  J-N the last surgical report        (see Philosophical   Magazine,
  vol. xxvii. no. cvii. p. 236.)       there were 144 patients under
  cure, from which period, during the four succeeding months,
  ending in June, there were admitted 473 persons.
                    Cured          -         -    392

     Having noticed the frequent occurrence            and danger of
 hernia (vol. xxvii. p. 236), which do not           appear to have
 been sufficiently appreciated,         or funds would have been
 raised in different districts for the purpose of affording relief
to those who have it not in their power to relieve them
selves ; whether the want         of ability arise from pure indi
gence,     or from  indiscretion,   it must be admitted that the
afflicted are entitled to the charitable consideration of a hu
mane public.
     In this metropolis     (which is truly characterized as being
pre-eminent to all cities in the world on account of its cha
ritable institutions) it certainly appears that this disease has
not passed unnoticed, as a " Society for the Relief of the
                                                           Ruptured

                Surgical     Cases    in the Cily Dispensary.              257
Ruptured Poor" was established some years ago: another
society of a similar nature has been advertised but a short
time since.          From these circumstances it might appear to a
superficial observer, that the public have already done enough
in providing for persons afflicted with this malady ; but in
proportion        as   these   societies increase in number,            not in
magnitude, will their benefits be felt by diseased individuals,
it being by the ready and easy access by which relief can be
obtained, that the subject is rendered               of more      real  public
utility.      Hence,     if  small funds were raised,         and connected
with     every    public dispensary, and          if they    were   even    ex
tended to every parish             throughout the kingdom (provided
there was resident in that parish a medical man of science
and humanity who would undertake to superintend free of
all pecuniary rewards), " it would be a saving to the com
munity       at large, by the prevention         of accidents, which         al
 ways tend to increase the parochial rates."
    This plan was recommended to the governors of the
Eastern Dispensary by Mr. Luxmore, surgeon, at my sug
 gestion, and has been adopted with much advantage                       to the
 poor in that district.
    A subscription          has also been set on foot, which may or
 may     not   be    connected      with the City Dispensary, but is
 equally calculated to afford relief to the afflicted supplicants,
 by giving to them the easiest possible access; and for every
 guinea subscribed the subscriber will be privileged to recom
 mend three         patients for single trusses, or one patient for a
 double truss.

    Upon the Teeth     of Elephants in general; their Structure,
          Growth, Succession, and Differences, with, respect to Age
          and Position.
     J. he manner in which these teeth grow and succeed each
    other is so extraordinary,they present in their various states,
    figures and sizes so variable, that it is not astonishing they
    have been so often mistaken.
          We      have    made   the     following observations upon              the   two
.   Indian        elephants we had occasion to dissect
                                              ; but we ought
    to acknowledge that we were guided by the excellent work
    of our colleague, M. Tenon, upon the teeth of the horse.
    Any thing peculiar we have seen in those of the elephant
    belongs only to their size and to their peculiar configura
    tion.
       We ought            also to acknowledge that excellent observations
    have been already        upon the particular subject of the
                                 made
    teeth of the elephant by M. Pallas f, Peter Camper and his
    son Adrian J, Messrs. Corse, Home§, and Blake         these                 ||:
    three last,       in   particular,    have almost exhausted the subject,
    each     of    them     having of himself discovered             some important
    facts.
       As      to the      manner in which            teeth   in   general     arise and
    grow,         our observations seem to us to confirm the theory                       of
    Hunter rather than that of any other author, in so far as
    regards that part of the teeth which has been called the os
    seous substance.   But this great anatomist does not seem
    to us to have been equally happy as to the enamel                         ;   and he
    has entirely mistaken the nature                 of    the third substance, pe

culiar to certain herbivorous              animals.     In  these  two last
respects       Mr. Blake     seems    to have    approached nearest      the
truth;      at the same time we are not           of opinion, with him,
that there are any vessels in the osseous substance.
   In fact, each grinder of the elephant, like any other tooth
whatever, is produced, and as it were conceived, in the in
terior of a membranous sac, which we shall call, in common
with several anatomists, its capsule.
   This sac, when viewed externally,               is in the elephant of a
rhomboidal form, not so high behind as before; it is close
on all sides, if we except the small openings for the passage
of  the nerves and vessels.
    It   is lodged in an osseous cavity,          of  the same form    with
itself,    in the maxillary bone,         and which is to form one day
the alveolus       of the tooth.
    It  is only the external lamina         of the capsule which     has the
simplicity of form         we have mentioned.          Its internal lamina
forms, on the contrary, as in herbivorous animals in gene
ral,   several folds; but in order to understand them we must
describe another part.
    I  here mean the pulpy nucleus            of the tooth ; in each ani
mal it has       a peculiar figure : in order to conceive that of the
elephant, let us imagine to ourselves, that from the bottom
of the capsule, taken as a base, there issue kinds of small
walls,     all  of them parallel,     all of them transverse, and pro
ceeding towards that pan of the sac which is ready to leave
the alveolus.
   These small walls only adhere to the bottom of the cap
sule; their opposite extremity, or, if we please, their sum
mit, is     free from all adherence whatever.
   This      free summit is much thinner than the base ; we may
call it their edge      ; it  is moreover deeply furrowed on its sur
face   with several very sharp points or notches.
   The substance of these small walls is soft, transparent,
very vascular, and seems much to resemble gelatine in its
nature; it becomes hard, white, and opake, in spirit of
wine.
    We may        also easily figure to ourselves      the folds  ofthe in
 ternal membrane of the capsule ; let us suppose that it forms
                                      R  2                     productions

    260         Memoir     upon    living and fossil Elephants.
    productions which penetrate into all the intervals of the
-
    small gelatinous walls I have described. These productions
    adhere to the face of the capsule which answers to the
  . mouth and to the two lateral faces, but they do not adhere
    to its bottom, whence arise the small walls or gelatinous pro
    ductions.     Consequently, we may conceive a possible and
    contain- us vacuum, although infinitely folded upon itself,
    amctfig all these small gelatinous walls (descending for the
    upper teeth and ascending for the lower ones), and these
    small membranous partitions (ascending in the upper teeth
    and descending in the lower ones).
       It is in this conceivable vacuum that the matters deposit
    themselves which are to form the teeth, viz. the substance
    vulgarly called osseous, which will be transuded by the ge
    latinous productions coming from the bottom of the cap
    sule, and the enamel which will be deposited by the mem
    branous partitions, and in general by the whole internal sur
    face of the capsule and of its productions, the base alone
    excepted.
       We must,       however,        remark, that between      this supposed
    Osseous    substance and         the enamel     there is also a very fine
    membrane which           I think     I hsve  discovered.     When    there
    is not as yet any part      of    the  first substance   transuded, this
    membrane envelops immediately the small gelatinous wall,
    and confines it more closely.
       In proportion     as   this small wall transudes       this substance,
    it retires inwards and removes itself from the membrane,
    which serves it nevertheless always as a tunic, but it is a
    tunic common to it and to the matter which                 has transuded
    under it.
       The   enamel    of its side is deposited upon this tunic hy the
    productions     of  the internal surface of the capsule, and it
    compresses it in such a manner against the internal or os
    seous substance,      that    the    latter separates from    it; and this
    tunic soon becomes imperceptible in the hardened portions
    of the tooth, or at least it does not appear, except upon the
    section, like   a very    slender grayish line, which separates the
    enamel    from   the    internal substance. But we then always
    Bee  that it is the latter alone which          attaches  these hardened
                                                                         parts

 parts to the bottom      of  the capsule ; for without     it the conti
 nuity would be broken.
    The substance called        osseous and the enamel     are therefore
 produced by a kind of juxtaposition ; the former is formed
 in  layers from the outside to the inside ; the interior layer
 is the last formed, and it is also the most extended, being
 absolutely the same as in shells ; and its formation com
 mencing by the most salient points of the gelatinous nu
 cleus of the tooth, it is at these points that this substance is
 thickest  ; it goes on becoming thinner in proportion as it re
 moves from them.
    If we    recur in our imagination to the epoch when this
 transudation takes place, we may conceive that there is
 formed a small cap upon each of the notches which divide
the edges of the small gelatinous walls already mentioned.
 In proportion     as new layers are added to the former, the
 caps change into conical horns ; if the new and interior lay
 ers descend to the bottom of the scars of the edges of these
 small walls, all the little horns unite into one single trans
versal lamina     ; lastly, if they descend      to the bottom of the
 small walls themselves, all the transversal laminae will unite
 into one single corona of a tooth, whioh would present the
 same eminences and the same sections which we see in its
gelatinous      nucleus,   if   during the time these layers were
 transuding,     other substances were not deposited above, and
had not partly filled the intervals.
    At first the enamel is deposited,         as I have said, upon the
 surface of the substance called osseous, by the internal mem
 brane of the capsule, under the form of small fibres, or rat
ther of small crystals, all of them perpendicular to this sur
 face, and forming- on it in the first stages ol dentition a kind
 of velvet, with fine hairs. When         we open the capsule      of the
 germ of a tooth, we find, small molecules of the future ena
 mel as yet very slightly adhering to the internal face of this
 capsule,    and   detaching     themselves   from it very easily.     A
 part of  these molecules also swims in a         liquor interposed be
 tween the capsule and the germ.            I never saw the small ve
 sicles adhering to the capsule from which Herissaut asserts
 the matter proceeds, that afterwards, upon drying, becomes

the enamel. The opinion of Hunter, that the enamel is only
the sediment of the liquid interposed between the tooth
and its capsule, is inaccurate, inasmuch as it keeps too far
out of view the capsular membrane, whence in reality the
molecules of the enamel issue ; but it is very true, that
these      molecules are at first between this membrane and                         the
tooth, before glueing themselves to the latter. As to the oth«r
opinion, which makes the enamel come out as if by efflo
rescence from the pores of the osseous substance ; although
it has been adopted by several anatomists, it has no founda
tion whatever.    But to return to our teeth.
     A thick      layer  of enamel thus coating                 the corona       on all
sides, fills a       part of the intervals which
                                              the transversal                        la
minae  and   their notches had at first left between  them.
     The   of these intervals is completely filled up by a third
           rest
substance, which Mr. Tenon has called osseous cortical, be
cause    it envelops all the others, and                     resembles   a common
bone in its chemical                  nature and       hardness, still more than
the two other parts              of   the    tooih.        Mr. Home calls it      bone,
while      he gives       the name      of ivory       to the substance vulgarly
called osseous.           Mr. Blake          gives    to this cortical    substance
the name of crusta petrosa.
  There is something very remarkable in its production. Mr.
Tenon thought it proceeded from the ossification of the in
ternal lamina         of   the capsule, after it has produced the ena
mel.   Mr. Blake thinks that this lamina, after having given
the enamel by one of its faces, gives the conical by its op
posite face. Mr. Home does not express himself clearly
upon this subject.
     For my part,         I am
                    convinced that the cortical is produce*
by the same lamina, and the same face which has produced
the enamel : the proof of this                       is,
                                  that this lamina remains
outside of the cortical,        as   was formerly outside of the ena
                                        it
mel,    and that     it remains there soft and free as long as this cor-
ticil   gives   it   room.   Itchanges in its texture alone; while                   it
was producing enamel only                   it   was thin and transparent.           In
order to produce cortical,   becomes thick, spongy, opaque
                                        it
and reddish. The  cortical when growing    not like thread*,   is
it   rather resembles small drops thrown out as                     if   by   chance.'

   The membranous productions of          the capsule of the    tooth
retire towards the top and the sides in proportion as the cor
tical which they deposit upon the enamel fills all the va
cuum which remained between the different lamina; of the
tooth.    The  peaks  of these laminae are covered with cortical
like the rest, while they are not in use.        One and the same
production of the capsule often deposits its cortical upon the
top of the lamina, which it again deposits upon the enamel,
only at the bottom.      It happens    also that the top of  the in
terval of the laminae      is already heaped    up by the cortical
when the base is still separated :     in this case, the bottom of
the capsular production is separated from the top, and does
not receive its nourishment any longer, except from its la
teral adherences  with the capsule.
   The deposition of the enamel begins almost with the trans-
udation of the osseous substance, and that of the cortical
follows closely after, in such a manner, that the summit of
each lamina is terminated in its three substances long before
its bottom,   and  that   its adjoining laminae are soldered to
gether by their summits before being as> yet hardened at their
bases.
   We may add to all this, that these various operations are
not executed at the same time in all parts of the tooth, but
they take place rather sooner before than behind.         We may
easily imagine that the anterior laminae will be already united
among themselves by their summits and even by their bases,
when the intermediate laminae will be still separated from each
other, at least by their bases ; and when the posterior laminae
are not even formed, and present only pointed and distinct
horns, which should form the summits of their notches.
   It therefore results from all     we have    advanced, that the
substances  of which the teeth       are composed are all formed
by excretion arid by layers ; that the internal substance in
particular has nothing in common with ordinary bones, ex
cept in its chemical nature, being equally formed of gela
tine and of calcareous phosphate ; but that it neither resem
bles them in its texture, in its manner of forming itself, nor
in its growing.    Its texture presents neither cellulosity nor

blish    a    passage    of vessels from the periosteum or the alveolus
into the mass           of the roots. The smallest possible fibre                                of
the pulpy nucleus docs not pass to the substance called os
seous; and the latter   connected with the rest of the body
                                     is
o.nly     by   its mechanical and forked formation.                              Thus no     part
of     the     tooth    is    regenerated        when    it    has been once drawn               ;
and    if     broken or cracked teeth sometimes reconsolidate,                              it   is
only     because new layers forming                    within, glue themselves                   to
the exterior ones, and glue the latter among each other.
   We shall also see new proofs of this when we come to
examine ivory, and thence we shall refute the objections
drawn   from the diseases of the teeth    but, in the mean      ;
while, we may safely affirm, that      very improperly that

the teeth the name of osseous substance,                             and equally impro

tion which develops and hardens them                            :        this   is   to confound
two things essentially different, and to give, ill applied                       by

 J. hat one of the most useful compendiums of the most
useful science should have passed through four editions in a
few years, is a circumstance perhaps not less honourable to
the taste and discrimination of the English public than to
its author.  It   is,
                   indeed, pleasing proof of the growing
                                 a
taste for chemical knowledge, and of the general utility of
this science to the conveniences and even necessaries of
social life.   Mr. Parkinson,      this fourth edition of his ex

coveries and observations made in chemical researches,                      espe

rangement.     The neutral salts, particularly the nitrates, are
very properly arranged according to the order of the affinities
of their respective bases with nitric acid      classification;   a
which, while    itassists the memory, tends considerably to
familiarise the mind of the young chemist with the impor
tant action of the affinities, which produce such extraordi
nary changes in almost all bodies. The additions and im
provements, indeed, throughout every page of this interest
ing compendium are often highly important, as relating to
the arts of dyeing, gilding, tanning, &c. &c., and suffi

of which is to common air as 480 to lOOO. 100 measures
of this gas require for their saturation 60 measures of oxy

tact with charcoal, this species of gas is formed, together
 with carbonic acid.
   " The gas obtained by the destructive distillation of pit
coal has been successfully applied to the purpose of afford
ing light by Mr. Murdoch in 1792, when he ascertained that
it could be employed as a substitute for lamps and candles.
It   has been since used for similar purposes in France, form
ing what        has   been     termed        the thermo lamp.         Mr. Henry,
pursuing Mr. Murdoch's experiments, found that hydrogen
gas, carburetted hydrogen gas, obtained by passing water
over ignited charcoal, and the carbonic oxide, burnt with a
very trifling production of light; and was induced to in
quire into the cause of the difference between these gases
and that derived from pit coal.     The latter gas, when re
cently prepared, evidently contains inflammable matter sus
pended    in    it,  which then increases its illuminating property;
but this       is   subsequently deposited still, however, the gaa

    H Now, reckoning that for the production             of each mea
sure of carbonic acid gas, an equal measure              of oxygen gas
is employed, then by deducting the numbers in the third
column from the corresponding ones in the second column,
•we find the number of the remaining measures which have
disappeared     in saturating the hydrogen of each gas ; and as one
measure    ot oxvgen saturates two of hydrogen, double that
number ot measures is the volume which the hydrogen con
tained in that gas would occupy if expanded to its usual state.
Thus, in the combustion of the gas from coal, of 60 mea
sures   of oxygen    gas employed, 35 measures        have gone to the
formation      ot carbonic      acid gas, and 25 measures have dis
appeared     with     the    hydrogen ;. double this quantity, 50
 measures, is therefore the quantity of hydrogen contained
 iu this  gas.    Agreeable to Mr. Henry's opinion, that the
 degree of illumination depended on the quantity of inflam
 mable matter contained in the gas, he found that the quan
 tity of light evolved by each gas was, as nearly as could be
judged, in proportion to the quantity of oxygen required for
 its combustion and detonation in a close vessel : so that,
 agreeable to the foregoing table, the gas from moist charcoal
 manifested least splendour, whilst theolefiant gas exceeds all
 the rest in brilliancy as well as in violence of detonation.
     "  Mr. Henry      also concludes     that the  inflammable gasea
 are mixtures     of a very few simple ones.        Gas from coals he
 supposes   to be hydrocarburet with some carbonic oxide, and
 a small portion, perhaps,       of olefiant gas : from charcoal, car
  bonic oxide,    with   hydrogen and a little hydrocarburet ; from
  oil and from wax, pure hydrocarburets ; except that the first
  contains one-eighth, and the latter one-fourth, of olefiant gas.
  The hydrocarburets from ether and alcohol he also found
  contained this gas     ;  from the various admixtures of which, he
  thinks,  proceeds     that difference which induced      Mr. Cruick-
  shank to suppose         so many different species     of carburetted
  hydrogen."

   An Inquiry into   the Changes induced on Atmospheric      Air  by
     the Germination    of Seeds,   the Vegetation  of Plants, and
     the Respiration of Animals. By DANIEL        ELLIS,   pp. 256,
     8vo. Murray, 1807.
     Perhaps no speculation      in experimental philosophy      has
  ever been more generally received, than the notion that plants
  in the process of vegetation purify the air; and since the dis
  coveries of Priestley, the labours of Ingenhousz, and the
  rhymes of Darwin, not only philosophers but ladies have
 beendelighted with their presence, under the influence of this
  pleasing fancy.      The opinion was first promulgated by
  Priestley in 1771, and almost without examination has been
 adopted by all subsequent philosophers, excepting some few
 indirect objections, down to the present author, whose able
 inquiry will most probably consign it to the oblivion of vul
 gar errors.
               " The investigation of this subject was suggested
 to him, he states, by accidentally observing the      spontaneous
 recovery   of  an  animal in whom all the appearances of life
 had been suspended by drowning.          The result of his inquiry
 terminated in   a conviction,  that although many great and im
 portant steps had been made, yet much hypothetical conjec
 ture was blended with established fact, and many suppositions
 were admitted into our theories which       hut ill accorded with
 the structure and ceconomy of the animal system." No refer
 ence is made to the theories of vegetation and respiration, as
 they must depend on our knowledge of the changes produced
by living bodies on the air; a,subjcct, it appears, with which
 we are yet very little acquainted.
     Mr. Ellis pursues his investigation     by examining     " the
 Changes induced on the Air by the Germination of Seeds —
iheVegetation of Plants — the Respiration of Insects, Worms,
Fishes and Amphibious Animals ; and of Birds, of Qua
drupeds, and of Man.        On the Source of the Carbon in Ve

and Animals."       The following is a brief abstract of his prin
cipal observations on germination       :
                                                             Dried

                  Notices respecting New Books.                 271
    Dried  seeds,  although exposed to heat and air, may be
kept to any indefinite time, without effecting a change in the
atmosphere, or undergoing any material disorganization.          If,
however, moisture      have  access   to them,    they immediately
begin to swell and germinate.        Four or  five days steeping  in
water, at 46°, or even 48 hours in temperatures from 60°
to 66°, occasion putrefaction,      carbonic acid and carburetted
hydrogen gases are produced, and the faculty of germinating
is destroyed.     Hence it is concluded that water alone is es
sential to germination, but if applied too long it disposes
to putrefaction.      Besides water, a certain degree of heat is
necessary to the germinating process. Light has been con
sidered another agent ; but, contrary       to the opinion of the
abbe Bertholin, the experiments of Ingenhousz and Setine-
bier controvert this supposition, by showing that light occa
 sions evaporation, generates cold, and thus retards vegeta
tion.     However, although water and heat, appear to be
 the only agents essential to the beginning of germination,
after a certain period air becomes equally necessary.
According to the experiments of Achard and others, nitro
 gen gas, which forms nearly four-fifths of the atmosphere,
 completely obstructs germination and the formation of car
 bonic acid.     Barley is converted into malt when exposed to
 oxygen gas, which gradually disappears, and carbonic acid
 takes its place ; hence oxygen is likewise essential to the
 process of germination.       A great variety of experiments,
 however, in different countries seem to establish as a fact,
 that of all known e;aseous bodies the usual composition of
 the atmosphere is that which most facilitates a vigorous ger
 mination,    a superabundance of oxygen as well as nitrogen
 being injurious. From these data a curious and somewhat
 difficult question arises, which the author discusses with
 great   precision and accurate knowledge.          The result of all
 the experiments on germination proves that the quantity of
  carbonic acid produced is very nearly in proportion to the
  quantity of oxygen which disappears : hence it is asked, By
  what process does a pea immersed in water absorb oxygen
  and disengage carbon ? Water alone neither absorbs oxygen
  por gives out carbon; and did the pea absorb oxygen, it must
                                                            acquire

9 79                           Notices respecting New Boohs.
acquire an additional weight in proportion ; which is con
trary to the fact proved by direct experiment.   Peas im
mersed in water by Cruickshank gave out carbon when no
germination took place, and when they approached the pu
trefactive process, in which case the quantity of air was in
creased.  But where germination took place, and oxygen dis
appeared and carbon appeared,    the quantity of air was not
increased but rather diminished.     Hence it is inferred, that
the oxygen which disappears is not all absorbed by the >eed
in germinating, but onl3 such a Quantity as is mt rely equi
valent to counterbalance the loss of carbon which unites
with      the oxygen to form carbonic acid, and in                           this   manner
effects a change in the volume only,           the weight and not in
either of the germinating seed or the incumbent gas. Mr.
Ellis concludes, that " in germination the seed does not
form carbonic acid from its own substance, but furnishes
only one of the constituent parts of                     it,
                                        namely, the carbon;

served, that the quantity  of carbonic  acid produced does ac
tually exceed in wtight the oxygen that disappears; and that
as " carbonic acid    necessarily  product and consequence
                                    is              a

may be alleged, however, that the water gives mechanical ex
pansibility to the seed, that the heat then effects its expansion,
and that     the latter process the carbon
                    in                         brought to stateis                   a
fit to combine    with   the  oxygen,   and thus   form carbonic
acid.
     In   the second           chapter   Mr. Ellis examines            the changes      in
duced on air              by   vegetation, in which he combats the opi
nion respecting the alternate emission                     of oxygen          and nitro
gen gases            by   plants, and observes,         that   "    both physiologists

and chemists seem, in this instance, to have satisfied them
selves with contemplating at a distance the beauty of the
final cause, instead of approaching            to a nearer examination
 of the facts on which the opinion                 has   been maintained."
 He argues thus :
  (t Against the
                  opinion of the absorption and emission of
gases by the leaves of plants when growing naturally in air,
we have already, both on physiological and oh chemical
grounds, been induced to enter our protest. That the same
substance, carbonic acid, should during the day be absorbed
by the leaf, and decomposed within it as salutary, and
during the night should be formed within the same leaf,
and emitted from it as! noxious, seems to be not only incon
sistent but absurd.             Where would    be the advantage        in   the
carbon of the acid being retained for twelve hours as food,
}f for the next twelve it must again be given out as excre-
mentitious ? Or where is there an instance, in the whole
circle of existence, of a living agent not only first forming
its own food, but feeding on its own excretions ? If this
carbon were during the day retained as food, whence conies
that composing the acid which plants, when confined in a
given bulk of air, are constantly forming ? If oxygen gas,
as these chemists suppose, be during the day constantly
emitted, why does that gas gradually disappear as the pro
cess of vegetation proceeds ? And why at last is none to
be met with, although there is present an abundance of car
bonic acid, out of which it is supposed to be formed ? It
has been proved   that during the day carbonic acid, by the
act of vegetation, is constantly forming; but               if,
                                                   at the same

and completely destroy its oxygenous portion ; which could
not possibly happen if they possessed the power of emitting
oxygen gas.   The experiments, indeed, of Dr. Ingenhousz
himself teach us, that this supposed emission of oxygen gas
does not depend           so much on the power            of   the leaves as on
the quality of the water in which they are immersed ; For,
if the water be previously boiled, little or no oxygen gas is
collected.   Hence, then, we see, that to effect the separa
tion of air from water         the organized structure           of the leaf is
not only not necessary, but that the quality of the separated
air is altogether different from what this supposed function
of the leaves ought to supply. No proof, therefore, of the
absorption and emission of gases, much less of oxygen gas,
by the natural functions of leaves, can be derived from these
experiments on plants immersed in water ; and were the ex
periments even more precise, they would not in the least
apply to the case of vegetables which flourish in the open
air."

emitting carbon ; for water and carbonic acid are expelled
from the lungs in respiration in the same manner as they
are produced by the skin when in contact with atmospheric
air.    As, therefore,   the products    of respiration and perspira
tion are in kind precisely similar, we are justified in ascrib
 ing their formation to similar laws ; and since it seems to
 have been demonstrated, by direct experiment, that no tran
 spiration of aeriform fluids takes place through the skin, we
may presume that none is able to be carried on through the
 cells and blood-vessels      of  the  lungs.    Not only is the cel
lular substance of the lungs furnished with absorbent and
 exhaiant vessels like that of the skin, but it is supplied from
within by     the same blood,     and exposed from without on the
same atmospheric air.         It has been shown also, that the co
lourless fluids of various animals are able to effect the same
 change on the air as that which is produced by the blood ;
 and that the serum of th,e blood itself (which i5 especially
 destined to supply the exhaiant function) produces on the
 air the same identical change as it experiences in the lungs ;
 all which circumstances strongly incline us to suppose that
the function of the lungs resembles in kind that of the skin.
The proofs likewise       already   adduced, that     the carbon fur
 nished by vegetables and by the inferior animals, as well
 those which perspire by the skin as those which breathe by
lungs, depends wholly on the due circulation of their fluids,
 and is, consequently, the result of a living action, are strong
 presumptive evidence, that the same law obtains in the su
 perior animals and in man ; and seem to authorize the con
clusion, that the carbon supplied in human respiration is
 truly an animal excretion carried on by the exhaiant vessels
 of the lungs ; and therefore that it primarily depends, like
 other excretions, on the due circulation and distribution of
 the blood,    and is more or less affected by all its variations.

  In all animals carbon      is a necessary  constituent substance,
 and the means       of acquiring it must be as constant as its ex
 pulsion during living action has been shown to be; and from
 no other source than through the organs of digestion and
 Secretion can it be conceived to be derived.          To these or
 gans   of digestion, assimilation,     and secretion alone, are we
 enabled to trace it    ; but our knowledge of the theory of these
 functions     in animals    as in vegetables is extremely limited
 and imperfect.        We have, indeed, of late succeeded in get
 ting rid of much error and absurdity, 'but have not) in any
 instance, attained to complete knowledge"
    The last chapter of this excellent and logical inquiry in
 vestigates
                "  the Phenomena which arise from the Changea
 induced     on the    Air by the living Functions of Vegetables
 and Animals." The general inconsistency and irreconcilea-
 blencss of the various opinions and experiments on this sub
ject have not deterred Mr. Ellis from selecting the principal
 facts which tend to explain        the  phenomena of respiration
 and animal heat.
    "  Animal heat,"       says the author,
                                             " in all the amphibia
 mentioned,       whether they inhabit the air or the water, seem*
 to follow nearly that of the medium in which they are
 placed;    and their standard temperature cannot, in conse'
 quence, be restricted to any fixed point, but must be con
 sidered always in relation to that of their surrounding me
dium.      Nevertheless,     the  low degree of heat which    these
animals possess, is a proof that they have within themselves
a power of producing heat.          The loss of heat which insects
suffer under cold, the fall of temperature in worms under
melting snow, demonstrate that the surrounding medium,
whether it be air or water, is constantly drawing off their
heat ; which renders necessary as constant a reproduction of
it.   It is  also evident,   from the experiments detailed, th»t
during a state of      torpor the temperature even of the warm*
blooded animals exceed* only in a small degree that of the
atmosphere by which their torpor is induced.          But on pass
ing into this torpid       state,  under which the temperature   so
greatly falls, the motion of the blood in animals gradually
declines, and at length, in some cases, wholly ceases.          All
                                                                the

the secretory functions of the animal must, at this period,
be suspended, in consequence of which the air in contact
with it undergoes no change           ;  but when heat is restored,
the hlood again renews its motion, the secretory functions
return, and ths air undergoes its'accustomed changes. These
changes consist in the conversion of its oxygen gas into car
bonic acid, by carbon emitted by these animals through the
medium of their respiratory organs.. By these means a quan
tity of the specific caloric of that gas is at the instant set
free; and to this constant        liberation    of caloric by the per
petual decomposition       of  the    air, do we ascribe that supe
                                                                        "
riority of temperature     above the surroundi»g        medium which
those animals,    as  well as vegetables,      during the continuance
of living action are enabled to exhibit and preserve.
    " In what manner, then, does the air breathed by the           su
perior animals give out its heat to support that high degree
of   temperature above the surrounding medium, which they
all possess  ?   We     have seen reason to conclude that the in
spired air is decomposed in the bronchial cells of the lungs'
 (which contain a superficies more than ten times greater
than that    of the whole body),          and  that all its oxygenous
 portion, which disappears, is converted into carbonic acid by
carbon emitted from the exhalant surface of those organs.
During this gradual conversion of           the oxygen gas, a quantity
of specific caloric, much greater than what is necessary to
 maintain the elasticity of the carbonic acid that is formed,
 is necessarily set free ; and to this excess of heat, thus con
 stantly liberated in the lungs by the decomposition of the
 air, do we look as the source of that superiority of tempera
 ture above the surrounding        medium,      which  man, and other
 animals,    under every     vicissitude of climate, are enabled to
 exhibit and maintain      "
     The author   proposes to pursue this inquiry, provided the
 present  volume    meets the approbation of the public.          This
 we think certain, and cannot doubt that he has long since
  received sufficiently flattering encouragement to induce him
  not to suspend his important researches.          He modestly states
  that he has  "  got  rid of much error and absurdity, but has
  attained nothing complete ;" but " the extensive seiies of

 facts which     he  has brought    together,  and the analogies
 which, from the evidence of experiment, he has endeavoured
 to trace among them, may direct the attention of future in
 quirers to a more comprehensive view of the subject than
 lias yet been taken, and impart a new degree of interest and
 utility to the research. The attempt also to combine the
 demonstrations     of anatomy with    the  chemical   phenomena
which we observe, and to consider both in connection and
 subservience to the laws which       characterize living beings,
 will,  he   trusts, meet   with the approbation of physiolo
 gists, and tend to     reduce within proper limits the applica
 tion of chemistry to this science."        In a word, we hazard
 nothing in saying that this is one of the most perfect ana
lytical treatises that have appeared in modern days ; that
the author's style is nervous, concise, and conspicuous ; and
 that with a complete knowledge of his subject, his induc
 tive arrangement of experiments and facts is well calculated
to establish a conviction of their accuracy and truth, and in
spire respect for this fascinating but difficult branch of che
mical science.      We would recommend         the  author to add
 the dates- to the experiments he has quoted, in his next edi
 tion, and thus present his readers with a brief but faithful
historical view of the progress of the human mind in this in
teresting department      of experimental philosophy.

the above learned body :
    "  A great number of substances     give out, in different cir
cumstances, a phosphorescent light, more or less lively, and
more or less durable : such as the fluate of lime, and some
varieties of phosphate of lime,        when we throw        them in
powder upon a heated body; the Bolognian phosphorus,
when, after having been exposed to the light, it is carried
into a dark place ; certain sulphurets of zinc, when rubbed
                                                               with

with   a   hard body, or even with the body of a quill ; rotten
wood,      some kinds of fish, and other animal substances
which approach putrefaction, when in a dark place, &c."
   The Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences proposes
as the subject of a prize in physics, which it will adjudge
at the public meeting on the first Monday of January 1809,
the following question :
   " To establish, by experiments, what are the relations
which exist between the different modes of phosphorescence,
and to what cause is each kind owing; excluding the exa
mination of th2 phenomena of this kind observed in living
animals."
   The prize for the best memoir upon this question is to be
a gold medal of the value of 3000 francs.
   The memoirs must be sent to the secretary of the Insti
tute before the 1st of October 1808.
   The Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences pro
posed in the public meeting before last the       following ques
tion, which they once more lay before the public :
   " To determine, by anatomical and chemical observations
and experiments, what are the phenomena of the torpidity
which certain animals, such as monkeys, hedge-hogs, &c.
experience, during winter, with respect to the circulation of
the blood, respiration, and irritability : to ascertain what are
the causes of this sleep, and wherefore it is peculiar to, these
animals."
   The memoirs on         the above  subject must be sent to the
secretary's    department of the Institute before the 1st of Oc

                            YEAR OF 1806.
Analysis of      the Labours     in   the   Physical Department,        as
                     drawn up by      M. Covier*.
   Jiy  the   orders   of the society     the limits  of  the   report we
are now about to make 'are confined to the period of six
months only ; but our report is not the less rich in interest
ing results from this circumstance. The numerous vacan
cies which have occurred this year             among the members of
the   Class of Mathematical         and     Physical  Sciences, by ex
citing   a lively emulation,    have produced a remarkable           col
lection of works in the various departments of the natural
sciences.      We shall continue faithfully to observe the prac
tice, hitherto adopted, of analysing these works at the same
time with those of our colleagues; the history of the sci
ences requires it: these labours, although foreign in appear
ance, are almost always connected with ours by the identity
of   the objects     of inquiry, and we almost always appro
priate some      part of them to ourselves; by repeating and
varying the observations which form their bases,                 we have
often occasion to appreciate their merits.
    Messrs.Bosc      and Silvester, the principal candidates       in the
agricultural department, have greatly improved upon some.

very excellent manuscripts on the science of agriculture, and
some works already published on particular branches ef it.
The important places with which government has intrusted
them in this part of the administration, and their extensive
acquirements in the physical sciences, have equally been
taken into consideration        :  the class has had the pleasure       of
adopting both of them as its members. M. Silvester has
succeeded M. Cels; and M. Bosc, a profound naturalist as
well   as  an experienced agriculturist,        and from whom          we
have    derived many important works upon the history of
animals, has taken the place of the veterinarist Gilbert,
which    has been vacant these five years.
   In the   botanical department there was no place to dispose
of, except that of the late M. Adanson ; but the competi
tion has not been the less brilliant on that account, both in
the number and importance of the works which the candi
dates have submitted to the judgment of the class. It ought
to be a great satisfaction to the friends of the sciences to be
informed     of these   striking proofs of the      zeal  of   those who
 cultivate them.
    M.   Palisot de Beauvois, who was          the   successful candi
 date, had strong claims, founded on his travels           in Africa and
 America, on his Flora of Otvare and of Benin, which we
have often mentioned        as having added some         singular plants
 to botany; on the Flora          of  the United    States   of America,
 which    he is preparing,    and    of which   he has already givea
 some    interesting   specimens;       and, lastly, on his long re
 searches upon the subject of those plants commonly deno
 minated cryplogamia.          These researches partly consist of
 descriptions of new species, and in establishing genera or
 other methodical distributions, of which it would be difficult
 to give an extract;     but they also comprehend more general
 objects, and chiefly a system upon the fecundation             of mosses
 and mushrooms, which w<S think ourselves so much the more
 bound to analyse, because, although this fecundation has
 been for a long time announced in works in very extensive
 and well-merited circulation, botanists do not seem to have
 paid sufficient attention to it.
    W« know that the mosses produce at            a  certain period pe
                                                                    dicles

                     French National Institute*
  dicles more or less long, terminated by capsules or urns        of
 a very complicated organization,         and filled with a dust  of
 various colours.
    Dillenius   and Linnaeus     thought these capsules were an-
 therae or organs     of the  male  sex, and they sought for those
 of the female sex in certain groups of leaves in the form of
 rosettes or stars, which we remark upon other parts of some
 of   these small plants.
    Their opinion however was never very prevalent ; it was
 thought, on the contrary, that the dust which filled the urns
 was the seed, and not the pollen.
     It then became necessary to inquire into the analogy of
 the stamina.       Hill thought he saw it in the ciliae on the
 edge    of the urn   ; Koshlreuter,   in the hood ; Schreber, in
 certain small threads at    thebottomof the pedicle; and others
 were of the same opinion also.
    But in 1774 a physician established at Chemnitz,           John
Hedwig,      a name subsequently very      celebrated, observing in
 the rosettes of some mosses some cylindrical bodies, which
 had been discovered a long time before by Micheli, perceived
 that they were open at the end, and that they emitted a pow
 der of excessive tenuity     : he did not doubt therefore that
these    were  antherae.   Having afterwards sown the grosser
dust which fills the urns, he saw moss spring up, and con
cluded that this dust was the grain, as several others had
supposed before his time, and consequently that the urn was
the fruit, or the female organ fecundated.
    These observations were first published in an abridged
form in 1777; — they were crowned by the academy of St.
Petersburgh in 1781, and followed up for more than thirty
years with most astonishing patience, and elucidated by co
pious works and by a great many designs made by the mi
croscope ; and they have obtained the approbation of almost
all the botanists of Europe, particularly of those who make
the mosses a particular object of study : the only objection,
advanced     very strongly at first, viz. that no rosettes were
found in certain genera of mosses, has been nearly destroyed,
since Hedwig, by dint of study, has succeeded in showing
that the anthers in these cases are in the buds of the axillae
                 l                                               of

of   the leaves, or rather that they accompany the base          of the
pedicle of the urn       :  in short,   he  has  shown them nearly in
all the genera.
     It is  nevertheless   this system, so strongly accredited, that
M.      de Beauvois combats, in order to substitute in its place
a system      which he presented to the Academy of Sciences of
Paris in 1782, and of which the following is the founda
tion:
     In   the midst   of this dust in the urns, which Hedwig re
gards     as the  grain, there is a kind of nucleus or small axis,
more or less swelled, called by botanists a columella. Those
who have observed it have seen nothing else in it than a pa-
renchyme more or less cellular ; Hedwig represents it seve
ral times in this manner : but M. de Beauvois says he has here
remarked some very small grains, and thinks that these are the
true seeds : the other dust which fills the urn around this nu
 cleus, is according to him the pollen ; the movements of the
 ciliae of the edge of the urn, when these ciliae exist, have
 only,     as he  thinks, for their object to compress the pol
 len against the seeds, in order to fecundate them at the mo
 ment they are about to escape.             Thus, according to M. de
 Beauvois,the urn is hermaphrodite, and all the complicated ap
 paratus of the organs taken by Hedwig for antherae, and which-
 is found in almost all the mosses, has no use that we know of:
 the individuals     of certain  species which bear rosettes  only, take
 no share at all in propagation ; the pollen is larger and more
  abundant than the seed : even the latter would have been in
 visible to almost every observer ; it would be fecundated, not
  in the ovary, and while yet tender and small, as all other plants
  are fecundated, but at the moment            of its escape, and when
  it  is already completely      developed   : in short, if we ask hovr
  M. Hedwig        produced mosses, by sowing what M. de Beau
  vois thinks is nothing else than the pollen, the latter an
  swers, that Hedwig sowed this almost invisible but real grain
  at the same time        with  the pollen,    without knowing it.     It
  may be thought, that in order to confirm so novel an          opinion,
   this grain should not only have been exhibited, but it should
   have been sown separately and detached from the other : un-
   fortunately,howcver,       this last experiment has not been made;

shipped    by the   natives, or some distinguished personages
among them.        It may be a subject of inquiry, who were
the predecessors      of the present     race  of Indians,  who
could    thus execute   such an excellent     resemblance of the
human form.

be demonstrated on recent Subjects,        and   further illustrated
by Preparations,      and the Functions of the different Organs
will be explained.
    The Surgical Operations      are performed,   and every Part of
Surgery so elucidated,       as may best    tend   to complete    the
operating Surgeon.
    The Art of Injecting,    and  of making Anatomical      Prepara
tions,    will be taught practically.
    Gentlemen      zealous in the Pursuit    of Zoology will    meet
with an uncommon Opportunity of prosecuting their Re
searches in Comparative Anatomy.
    Surgeons in the Army and Navy may be assisted in re
newing their Anatomical Knowledge,             and every possible
Attention will be paid to their Accommodation as well as
Instruction.

      Spacious Apartments, thoroughly ventilated, and replete
  with every Convenience, will be open at Eight o'CIoclc in
  the Morning till Four in the Afternoon, for the Purposes of
  Dissecting and Injecting, where Mr. Brookes attends to di
  rect the Students, and demonstrate the .various Parts as
  they appear on Dissection.
      An    extensive  Museum, containing Preparations illustra
  tive of every Part of the Human Body, and its Diseases, ap
  pertains to this Theatre, to which Students will have oc
  casional Admittance.      — Gentlemen inclined     to support this
  School by contributing preternatural or morbid Parts, Subjects
  in Natural History, &c. (individually of little Value ^o the
  Possessors) may have the pleasure of seeing them preserved,
 arranged, and registered, with the Names of the Donors.
      The Inconveniencies usually attending Anatomical Inves
  tigations     are counteracted by Antiseptic    Process,  the result
  of Experiments       made by   Mr. Brookes on Human Subjects,
  at Paris, in the Year 1782; the Account of which was deli
  vered     to the   Royal Society, and read on the 1 7th of June
   1784.      This method    has since been so far improved, that
• the    florid colour of    the Muscles is preserved,      and even
  heightened.        Pupils may be accommodated in the House. —
  Gentlemen established         in Practice, desirous of renewing
  their Anatomical Knowledge, may be accommodated with
  an Apartment to Dissect in privately.

       XL.    Facts    for a History of the Gallic Acid.                 By
                      M. BOUILLON-LAGRANGB*.
vJp     all the vegetable acids, the gallic aciJ mav be regarded
as that    which presents most interest ; it has therefore been
the object     of the inquiries of          several chemists.          Macquer,
Monnet, Lewis, Cartheuser,                 and    Gioanetti,       have   pointed
out the method in which substances                  called astringents ope
rate   upon    solutions     of   iron.      The   academicians         of Dijon
were the first to ascertain the presence of an acid in these
Substances; and in 1772 they snowed that ihe products di
stilled from gall-nuts blackened the solution of sulphate of
iron,  and that its infusion reddened turnsole tincture.                   These
details were as yet nothing more than a general proof of the
acid nature of the principle of gall-nuts, hut they did not
furnish the means of extracting and obtaining this acid se
parately; it is to Scheele we owe this discovery.                       His pro-i
cess was published in 1780.                 M. Deyeux, some years -af
terwards,     (in 1793,) discovered that this acid might be ob
tained by sublimation.             Messrs. Berthnlltt and Proust af
terwards added by their researches to the knowledge we pos
sessed already      of  the properties      of this  acid    ;  so that we may
now regard it       as one   of  the best known         vegetable     acids.
   Several    foreign chemists have also given, within these few-
years, processes for the extraction and purification of this
acid : but none of them, M. Richter excepted, have rivalled
M. Scheele's. Among the number of experiments which
chemists have made upon this subject, there is one which                        I
have never seen either quoted or refuted in the various me
moirs published upon the gallic acid.
   We found in a letter of M. G. Charles                           Bartholdi   to
M.    Berthollet,     in the    year 1792, some facts which deserve
attention.
   M. Bartholdi first points out             a  process     for obtaining pure
gallic acid ; he afterwards treats this acid                with metallic ox
ides.    The author informs           us that all the bodies         which give
up oxygen       to   the gallic acid make its colour brown ; that,

 in  these operations,      the acid itself,    by carbonizing,     forms,
 after a slight combustion,         colouring    particles.
     For this purpose       he boiled red oxide      of mercury for half
 an hour in a solution       of gallic acid, which assumed a blackish
 colour.      He found in the residue revived mercury mixed
 with    a  charry powder;      he afterwards      saturated   the liquor
 with    carbonates    of   potash    and   soda.    These salts did not
 give him any blue precipitate with the sulphate of iron.                He
 obtained a similar result with the oxide of manganese.
    Other experiments persuaded the author that those bodies
 which     take up oxygen from the eallic acid brighten its co
 lour.     " I have made (says M. Bartholdi) a solution of
 gallic acid as limpid as distilled water, having boiled it for
 some time with very pure and well pulverized charcoal,
 which I used in double its weight to that of the acid; it
 preserved     its limpidity as long as I kept it from the influ
 ence   of the atmosphere, and it precipitated the iron in a
 black colour."
    M.   Bartholdi    presumes     that we may thus succeed in          de
 stroying the astringent property.
    I shall not indulge myself upon the present occasion in
 any observations ; it will be necessary, in order to limit them
 precisely, to detail the following experiments           :
                    Extraction of      the  Gallic Add,
    There are several       processes     for extracting this acid from
 gall-nuts.
    Schetifa's Process.  — We pour upon           one part  of gall-nuts,
 pounded, and passed through            a coarse sieve, six parts, nf cold
water. We must then infuse it in a glass bowl for four
days taking care to stir it often; it must be then filtered,
the   liquor exposed to the free air in the same vessel, cohered
with a piece of gray paper only : a month afterwards we find
this infusion covered with a thick mouldy pellicle, without
any precipitate being formed ; it lias no longer any astrin
gent taste, but it is acid. The liquor is now allowed to rest
for five weeks ; there is then formed a precipitate two fingers
in thickness, and there is a mucous pellicle above it. The
infusion is filtered, and again           exposed   to the air.    At  the
                          4                                            end

end   of some months        the greatest par' of  the liquor has eva
porated     ;  all the precipitates are collected, and cold water
poured above them ; they are allowed to subside, and are
then decanted : as much hot water is added as is neces
sary for solution; it is filtered, and evaporated in a gentle
heat, and yellow crystals are obtained.
    M. Barthold'Cs Process. — We evaporate              the  alcoholic
tincture      of gall-nuts;    we afterwards dissolve in distilled
water, and add to the solution sulphuric acid until the
mixture has acquired a decidedly acid taste; the extractive
matter is precipitated in a few hours; and the supernatant
fluid, freed from the sulphuric acid by means ot baryies,
gives, according to the author, pure gallic acid.
    This process does not present this result. It is generally
very difficult to catch the moment when all the acid is taken
up by the barytes, considering that it is also combined with
gallic acid.        Nothing remains after the evaporation of the
liquor, except a bitter substance, containing a great deal of
tannin, and which is not susceptible of crystallizing.
    M. Dei/eii-x's Process. —This chemist discovered lhat, by
heating slowly and cautiously in a glass retort pounded gall-
nuts, there        was sublimed a considerable quantity      of lamel-
 lated    brilliant crystals.
    M.     Richter's Process.  — Digest gall-nuts,     reduced  into a
fine powder, in cold water, taking care to stir the mixture
 frequently.        After some time, the whole is pressed out
 through a linen cloth ; the residue is mixed once more
 with water and subjected to the press: the liquors are mixed,
 and evaporated at H very gentle heat ; a blackish brown and
 very brittle substance is obtained : this substance, when re
 duced     to a fine powder and digested      with very pure alcohol,
 yields a slight straw colour.        The  second   infusion is almost
 colourless ; it leaves a brown residue, which is almost en
 tirely pure tannin.        These two alcoholic liquors are mixed
 and distilled in a small retort to one-eighth.         Upon cooling,
 the   liquor congeals into     a mass ; water is then poured above,
 and     the   mixture is slightly heated : we then obtain a clear
 »nd almost colourless solution.
     If we submit this solution to evaporation, we may obtain
                                   T2                             from

from it very small and very white prismatic crystals ; the
mother water furnishes them also, hut the se are generally
a little coloured ; it is sufficient to wash them with water',
in order   to obtain them very white.       We obtain by this pro
cess half an ounce of crystals for eachu pound of gall-nuts:
these crystals are extremely light.
    The processes of Scheele, Deyeux, and Richter, have
given us the most advantageous results ; but they differ with
respect to the purity of their acid.         The first, as M. Ber-
thollet has observed, retains      a great  deal    of tannin  ;  the se
cond is perfectly white, and the third contains tannin also.
    By M. Richter's process, the acid, after having been pu
rified, is of a straw colour.      I tried, without effect, to bring
it to  that state  of purity pointed out by the author:          I ascer
tained that,   if we wished to pursue the evaporation,           desicca
tion,   and afterwards the action of alcohol, we might each
time decompose a ceitain quantity of acid, so that the alco
holic liquor, in place of being more transparent, would be
come brown.        There is therefore a term at which we must
stop, if we wish to preserve the totality of the acid as well
as its properties.
    M. Berthollet has attempted several methods of purifying
Scheele's acid ; the plan which succeeded best, was to treat
this acid with oxide of tin recently precipitated from its so
lution by an acid.
    I repeated this experiment. The following is the manner
in which I operated, and       the phenomena         I observed :
    After having separated     the oxide from       the muriate     of tin
by an alkaline base, it was washed clean with boiling water;
it was then boiled for some time in a new quantity of water.
It  was afterwards treated with gallic acid, and evaporated             to
the consistence      of thick honey.       Distilled    water was then
added ; the liquor, after having been          filtered, was clear and
limpid,    and   without   taste  or  smell  :    when evaporated to
dryness no produce was obtained.
    This difference in the results obtained by M, Berthollet
gave    me reason to suppose      that I had committed an error:
I began the experiment again, and paid every possible atten
tion to it.
                                                             I dissolved

              Facts for  a History of      the  Gallic Add.         293
    I  dissolved 61 grammes of gallic acid, confusedly crystal
lized and still very brown, in five hectogrammes of boiling
water.      I kept a part of tbis solution in order to compare it ;
the    rest was submitted to ebullition         with 61 grains of oxide
of tin well    washed  and stili   humid; I      evaporated until there
remained about       half of the liqi' ir only,       and  1 afterwards
added a sufficient quantity of Vater to restore it to its pri
mitive weight : 1 then compared them ; the latter had lost
its colour considerably.          The difference in the degree of
acidity    was   not sensible   ;   it still  precipitated glue. The
precipitate of it was yellow and flocculent, while that by
the unpurified liquor was brown, muddy, and more abun
dant ; it even congealed into a mass.             We see that the acid
is not yet decomposed ; hut I could not obtain, like M. Ber-
thollet, crystals so white and pure as those given by the
process of sublimation.
     Being desirous of knowing if a new quantity             of oxide of
tin would entirely deprive this acid of tannin,              I added  to
tiie liquor 30 gramma:, of oxide of tin, and evaporated
until there only remained about 100 grammes of liquor,
 which was poured off clear without colour; it did not pre
 cipitate either sulphate of iron        or- glue.   I could not obtain
 gallic acid by evaporation.
     This experiment     proves    that it is very difficult to deprive
 the gallic acid completely       of tannin ; and that, by pursuing
 the action of the    oxide of tin, we decompose the acid.             It
 is certainly in this manner that M. Proust has proceeded}
 because this chemist has observed in hi» Memoir upon Tan
 nin, printed in the Annales de Cfiimie, torn. xlii. that the
 oxide of tin he used for purifying the gallic acid, only gave
  him as a product a liquor without taste or colour, making
  not the slightest impression         upon the solutions of iron or
  tincture of turnsole.
      As  to the methods proposed          by M. Bartholdi, I do not
  think   they can be employed.          However, as the author has
  neglected to examine the products of his operations, I
  thought it was necessary to repeat his experiments, and to
  determine the matter of the results to which they might give
   birth.    For this purpose I poured a solution of gallic acid
                                   T   3                            upon

 upon the red oxide of mercury; it instantly became brown^
 and afterwards changed to black : the liquor then assumed
 a deep brown colour : in this state it was still acid, gave a
 blue colour to         a  solution of sulphate of iron, and precipitated
 glue   ;  but it did not contain mercury.
    I  boiled this liquor over a new quantity of oxide ; it then
 became clear, without colour, and did not contain either
 tannin or gallic acid.
    A part of the oxide of mercury was reduced ; the other
 •was mixed with concrete phosphoric acid, but nothing was
 sublimed by the action of caloric.
    If  we use charcoil previously purified in place of red oxide
 of mercury, the solution of gallic acid loses almost entirely
its colour and taste           ; the  liquor becomes green, and does    not
 precipitate glue;          but it still gives a violet blueish tint to the
 solution of sulphate of iron. When boiled with               a new quan
tity of charcoal          the liquid becomes     colourless, and produces
no change in the solutions                 of glue and sulphate of iron.
After having          evaporated     it to dryness, there remained in the
capsule     a  brown        substance, which      precipitated the acetate
of   lead    in   a  dirty gray    colour,   and  the nitrate of mercury
and muriate of tin in yellow ; we may therefore consider it
as beina an extractive matter.
   These experiments demonstrate that there exists no other
process for purifying the gallic acid of Scheele, except sub--
lunation ; at least, that the proportions of oxide of tin em
ployed by M. Berihollet, hut which he has not pointed out,
have not a itrcat influence upon the result.               The method    of
purifying       it by sublimation, however, cannot be admitted
if we     wish to preserve all its properties.          The different cha
racters presented by these acids furnish the proof of this
assertion.

an excess makes   it pass to the colour of pea blossom ; and
if we add some drops of nitric acid, the liquor becomes rose-
coloured.   The same phaenomena take place with barytes.
   This solution assumes a colour more or less greenish with
the carbonate of soda               ;   with that of ammonia the colour does
not change. It is a deep brown with caustic potash, and
with ammonia it is of a reddish brown.
  With the green sulphate of iron the colour is violet blue,
which is constant with this sulphate; an excess does not
change it.           With   the nitrate of mercury we obtain a yellow
precipitate;         it is white with the acetate of lead and the mu
riate of tin.
      The solution          of this      acid presents no phenomenon                    with
the oxymuriatic             acid.
      It forms      an abundant precipitate with glue.
      The   same experiments have been made upon the acid ob
tained       by M. Richter's process : the results were similar,
with       this sole difference, that it tunned with glue a very
small quantity of precipitate.

      The solution of this              acid in warm water liberates                 an aro

slight oily pellicle.

  to the fawn colour

     Caustic potash makes                it   brown   ;     the colour      is   clearer with

      If we
         pour into this acid liquor some drops of solution of                    a
sulphate of iron, we obtain blue colour which soon becomes
                                              a

of    a   deep green.        This       proceeds,      without doubt, from some
particular       circumstances.                   think          we   may    attribute this

phenomenon to the state of oxygenation of the iron ; be
cause, with the muriate of iron at the maximum, we have
constantly a green colour.      This effect is less remarkable
with the two other acids ; the cold infusion of gall-nuts al
ways retains its lieautiful blue colour.
     With nitrate of mercury the precipitate is blackish                      ;   that
by the acetate of lead is fawn-coloured, and very light.
  The sulphates of zinc, copper, and muriate of tin, present
no phenomenon.
  Oxymuriatic acid browns the solution of gallic acid, and
an excess d'scolours the liquo.r.
     On comparing        the differences presented             by these acids it
will   be easy to appreciate          them.
     The sublimed acid  is less acid ; it is decomposed in the
air; it                upon barytes, upon carbonate of am
           has no action
monia, nor upon muriate-of tin.       The precipitate obtained
with tlie nitrate of mercury is blackish in place of being yel
low; that of        the acetate      of   lead is slight and fawn-coloured
in place of being white            and abundant.
   Oxymuriatic acid browns a clear and transparent solution
of the sublimed acid, while it does not' change the colour of
that of the crystallized acid.
     In short, this acid       does not give           a constant    colour with
sulphate of iron, and does not precipitate glue.
   If it be easy to demonstrate the characters which distin
guish these two acids, it is otherwise when we wish to ex
plain whence their difference arises.  M. Bcrthollet has well
ascertained that the acid of Scheele, not purified, contained
a great deal of tannin ; ancl he found that when purified by
oxide of tin it did not precipitate glue.
     As   to   M. Renter's      process, I have pointed out above the
analogy it       has with      Scheele's acid ; nevertheless these two
acids seem to me to differ from that obtained by sublima
tion ; this last contains a small quantity of volatile oil, which
is combined with         it,   and which with           the help    of caloric    as
sumes     a    character which relates         it   to the resinified oils.       We
may ascertain this property               by   dissolving    this sublimed acid
either in ether or ia alcohol         ;   if    we volatilize      the liquid      by
                                                                         rubbing

rubbing it on the skin, we feel an effect similar to that pro
duced by a resin dissolved in alcohol.
      It     is not without        difficulty,            as may well
                                                   supposed,              be
that we succeed  in ascertaining correctly the nature of the
gallic acid. Does this acid exist completely formed in gall-
nuts?   May we regard it as a particular acid ; or rather, is
it not the result of the combination of a vegetaole acid
with tannin, with extractive matter, or with other sub
stances         existing in gall-nuts             ?       These are questions which
stitl        remain to be resolved.                   I    endeavoured, by a course
of experiments,            to add some facts to those                   already    known ;
and         if they   do not as yet lead to a complete solution, I                    ihink
that we shall find iu them some new results, at least,                               which
will        serve to ascertain the nature aud^propenies                     of    the gallic
acid.

guments to those who have                             attempted to refer pheno
mena of this kind to a principle essentially different from
electricity. The examination to which I submitted a great
number of substances relatively to the phaenomena they pre
sent, when we employ them to close the galvanic circle from
one pole to the other of the pile, has furnished me with an
swers to some of these arguments: but I obtained from them

A   given substance being applied to the two poles                                      of the
pile, there constantly happens one of five things i
       1.     This substance, not acting                   separately   upon any        of   the
poles, leaves them therefore perfectly insulated, when we try
to put them in conflict by its intermedium;                             whence it results

   that the intervention of the substance              employed does not
   modify in the least the electrical tension, which remains at
   the natural maximum at each pole ; and that this substance
   belongs to the class of perfect insulators.
       2. The two poles exercise, by the intermedium of the sub
   stance applied, a reciprocal reaction so intimate, that, neu
   tralising itself perfectly, every phaenomenon peculiar to each
   ceases, and we cannot act upon any             of them in    a distinct or
   appreciable manner.            These substances      belong to the class
   of perfect conductors.
      3. The     substance      applied to the two poles permits their
-
   reciprocal    reaction and closes the Galvanic circle, but in a
   manner so imperfect, that the distinct effect of each pole
   continues to manifest itself, and by the intermedium of this
   substance we may influence separately each pole in particu
   lar,   according    as we act     with one or other of the imperfect
  conductors.
      4. The substance by which we make the two poles commu
   nicate, acting like a perfect conductor, when we apply it
   separately to each of them, is found however to belong ex
   clusively to the positive pole, the instant we apply it to both
  of them at once, with the view of closing the galvanic cir
  cle. The conductors of this class do not operate the clo
  sure   of   the circle,    on account    of  the isolated  state in  which
  they leave the negative effect ;         and we cannot by their inter
  medium in the conflict of the two poles either charge the po
  sitive or discharge the negative.
      5.  Lastly,   the effect previously indicated is reproduced          in
  the same manner, but in an inverse sense ; i. e. the sub
  stance which separately acts upon each pole, as a perfect con
  ductor would do, belongs entirely to the negative pole from
  the moment we apply it siuiult .•uunsly to the two extremi
  ties   of  the  pile; hence results the maximum of electrical
  tension    for the   positive pole, and the impossibility of produ
  cing any divergency on the negative Side by the intermedium
  of sub=tances of this fifth class.

                                   §  I-
 Conductors, which in the Conflict of the two Poles isolate the
    negative Effect wlule they continue to propagate positive
     Electricity.
     When      we   apply separately    to each   of  the poles   of  the
 pile the    flame    of a lamp of spirits of wine,       it acts like a
 perfect conductor ; but when applied simultaneously to the
 two poles it totally isolates the negative effect, while it conti
 nues to conduct with the same energy the positive elfctricity,
 and consequently from this partial isolation the closure of
 the Galvanic circle does not take place.
     If at either of the poles of a pile well isolated,          of   100
 couples or thereabouts, we apply an electrometer foraicd of
 gold leaves, they soon assunae the degree of divergency
 which corresponds to the energy of the pile, and to the more
 or less perfect isolation by the ambient air of the opposite
 pole. When the instrument is stationary in its divergency,
 we present to the metallic wire of the opposite pole the
 flame of a spirit of wine lamp perfectly isolated ; the electro-           .
  meter does not increase in divergency ; but the instant we
  put the flame in communication with the ground, by intro
  ducing into it a metallic wire not isolated, the electrometer
  assumes    a  divergence   as strong   as if we  had made the isola
  tion of the opposite pole to cease.
      We may also take it radically away from each of them,
  each pole being in communication with an electrometer, by
  a metallic wire.       If an isolated flame touches one of these
  wires, the electrometer with which it corresponds loses no
  part  of its divergencey, but it     is entirely taken away from it
   the instant we place     the flame in direct communication with
  the ground.
      We    see   these two effects united by preparing two flames
   perfectly isolated, and by conducting            into each one of
   the metallic wires proceeding from the extremities of the
                                                                      pile.

  pile.    If  the isolation   is perfect,  electrometers, when ap
  plied to the two points,        will indicate in  a few seconds the
  same state    of divergency    as if the poles were not in contact
  w"ith tlie flame.     If, however,     we put one  of the flames in
  communication with the ground, the electrometer of this
  pole immediately loses all its divergency, and it passes to the
  maximum in the electrometer of the opposite pole. The
  alternate contact of the two flames therefore produces the
  same effect as    if we  had immediately touched the extremities
 of   the pile itself.
     Lastly, in order to ascertain still more convincingly that
 flame is     a better conductor for all the effects of the pile
 which are not connected with the closing of the circle, we
 may bend the metallic stalk which surmounts an electrome
 ter so as to make the point of it touch an isolated flame ; we
 must bring into this same flame a metallic wire coming from
 one of the poles ; and then, if we touch the opposite pole, the
 electrometer will receive through the flame the maximum of
 the divergency relative to this case.         If we afterwards touch
 the electrometer itself, the pole at which it communicates,
 by the intermedium         of  the  flame, is discharged.    At least
 upon touching        the flame we discharge at one and the same
 time both the electrometer of this pole and that which enters
 into the flame.
     Here   there   are electrical effects  of  the pile, which  flame
 certainly does not isolate.         Let us see what is the influence
 of this same flame,        when   we  apply it simultaneously to the
two poles, with the intention of closing by its intermedium
the Galvanic circle.
    After having fixed to a very sensible electrometer each
pole of a pile well isolated and composed of about 1 50 couples
of silver and zinc, we make to proceed from each pole a
metallic wire supported by a stalk perfectly isolating: the ex
tremities of the two wires are brought so near as to enter
into the flame at one and the same time. Upon an isolating
support we then place a spirit of wine lamp, and the experi
ment beeins. The instant we put the two metallic wires in
communication with the flame, so long as the latter remains
                                                             isolated,

           On two new Classes     of Galvanic Conductors.        301
Isolated, the electrometers of the two poles diverge nearly as
if the two polar wires were perfectly isolated ; and it is only
after a certain time that the electrometer of the negative pole
offers. a divergence a little stronger than that of the positive :
but   as to the   rest, every thing seems to bespeak an absolute
isolation    ; for, on putting any one of the poles in com
munication with the ground, its electrometer loses all its di
vergency, and that of the opposite pole arrives at the maxi
mum ; and if we touch simultaneously the two poles, we
receive a shock as strong as if the two poles were isolated by
a body of air.
    It  would    seem    that hitherto   this experiment alone has
been adduced, as proving that flame isolates all the Galvanic
effects ; but we shall see, by the following facts, that this
isolation is only partial, and thai, as to the positive pole,flame
 continues to be an excellent conductor.
    Every thing remaining as in the preceding experiment,
 we do away the isolation of the flame by introducing into
 it a metallic rod. Instantly all the divergence passes to
 the negative pole, and the positive is absolutely discharged.
 If we    have previously given to the negative     electrometer the
 strongest possible degree of divergence by touching the op
 posite pole, the application of a good conductor to the flame
 will never take away the least particle of this negative di
vergency,      while this same application destroys in an instant
 every vestige    of divergence given anteriorly      to the; positive
 pole, and carries it to the negative side in the strongest pos
 sible degree.
    Flame, therefore, belongs entirely to the positive pole, be
 cause    it is impossible to act upon the negative side by its
 means, and all       the   electro-metrical  indications   announce
 that the Galvanic circle is not closed by its interposition.
    While it is     an excellent conductor for each pole of the
 pile  in  particular, it isolates completely the negative side in
 the conflict of the two poles, without ceasing to be emi
nently conductory of the positive effect.
                                                                §11.

 Of       those Conductors which                   during the Conflict of the two
     Pole* isolate the positive                     Effect, while they continue to
     propagate negative Electricity.
     A    solid   prism           of soap, completely dried and applied to
any of  the poles             of
                      the Galvanic pile, propagates into the
ground all the electricity of this pole, and produces on the
opposite side the maximum of electrical tension.     There is
not, relative         to this effect, .any difference between                    its action
upon the two poles ; and the soap acts                             as   well   as the   most
perfect conductor can do.
     If   we make a metallic wire proceed                      from each extremity
of   the pile,        and    if   we   extremity of each of
                                         plunge the free
these two wires into the same prism of soap perfectly iso
lated, we do not perceive any remarkable effect ; i. e. after
having brought to the same level of tension the two poles,
by applying to them an isolated metallic rod, the electro
meters of the two poles will act as they did before the inter
vention of the soap, and when                        a    body of air isolated          them
perfectly from each other.
   But at the same instant we put the soap in free commu
nication with the ground, the positive electrometer presents
the maximum of divergency, and that                            of   the    negative side
loses      every vestige           of    it,precisely as      if   we    had    placed the
negative        pole itself             in communication            with   the ground.
Consequently,               the soap which isolates             the positive effect           is
aconductor perfectly continued for the negative effect to
which   belongs
           it      all its extent; for,
                             in         we touch   with a     if                 it
very small        point,          very near    the point where the wire of the
positive pole enters,     entirely impossible to take away
                                   it    is
thereby any portion of positive electricity, so absolute the                           is
isolation of this pole.
   The flame of phosphorus also conducts the effect of each
pole in particular, and in the conflicts of the two effects                                 it
belongs exclusively to the negative pole, like soap.
I    have often witnessed the same property in gelatine
brought to    certain degree of concentration, as well as in
                  a
                                                                                      ivory   :

ivory   :  but other masses of these same substances presenting
these     phenomena in a very equivocal manner only, I abs
tain    from    deciding upon them, and confine myself to
pointing out soap and the flame of the phosphorus as com
posing the fifth class of substances, which, when applied to
each individual       pole, act as excellent conductors, hit which,
when interposed between one pole and the oilier, isolate the
positive effect, without ceasing to conduct in a perfect manner
 the negative electricity.
    In order    to describe precisely the whole      of  these phaeno-
mena by concise expressions which may fix them in the
 memory, I propose the following nomenclature, for avoid
ing circumlocutions,         and to banish equivocal expressions.
    The bodies which        we may apply to the poles     of a pile are :
 Isolating (A),      1st class.
 Conductors       perfect (B), 2d class.

    A.    Isolating by their contact. —These do not change any
 of  the two poles separately, and do not take away ihe charge
 from any     of them in the conflict of        the  two poles ; they
 consequently isolate every effect at the two poles at once.
 Such are, glass, roots, water, water in a state of vapour,
 sulphur and its flame, amber but not its flame,            &c.
    B. Perfect conductors.      —They      charge and discharge each
 individual pole; but in the conflict of the two poles every
 vestige    of polarity disappears at the positive as at the nega
 tive, and the circle is perfectly closed.        To this ilas* belong
 the metals, and all of them in the same degree.
    C. Imperfect      conductors.  —The    characteristic effects of the
 two poles may also be discerned during ihe application of
 these substances to the two poles simultaneously.             They are
 divided into three classes.

    D. Positive unipolar. —The Galvanic circle         is not closed;
 the substance applied to the two poles, only conducts the
 positive effect and isolates the negative; whence results the
 charge of the negative, and       the impossibility      of charging
 the positive.       i
    This faculty belongs to the flame of hydrogen gas, and to
 that of the hydrocarbonated bodies.
    E. Negative unipolar. —The Galvanic circle is not closed;
 the substance   applied to the two poles isolates the positive
 effect and conducts the negative     effects.   Its contact charges
 the positive exclusively,   and adds nothing       to the negative.
 This class  is composed    of the Jlame uf phosphorus         and of
 the alkaline soaps.

L   0BSERVED in the Monthly Magazine of September IS0fy
some critical remarks on earl Stanhope's Method of tuning
Keyed Instruments ; I havs also seen Mr. Farcy's calcula
tions and his philosophical disquisitions in your Magazines
of April and May last on the subject; but they are not suffi
ciently satisfactory to jnduce me to alter my opinion of the
method I published in 1805, prior to earl Stanhope's.               I
think the principle upon which the noble earl has acted i«
very ingenious,    and I sincerely   wish his lordship had suc
ceeded in his endeavour to give a better effect to the instru
ment by his means of dividing the enharmonic difference
of those tones which in extended modulation (from the im
perfection of the instrument) become substitutes for real
ones, and which inevitably produce those disgusting chords
termed wolves by some. It is to be lamented there are such
insurmountable difficulties in melodizing or softening those
tones; indeed, I despair of ever hearing tolerable harmony
throughout the twenty-four keys of the present scale; con
sequently, conceive it to be impracticable^ unless two scalct,

  method that       [  chose    in my publication on temperamenly
   1805, (with submission to the learned Dr. Bradley, whom
  I have not the honour of knowing) was upon the principle
  of a specific division of the major tones of the scale, which
  must occasionally serve as minor tones, and is effected by
  subtracting one-fifth of a comma from a certain number of
  perfect fifths, in order to temper those tones which in every
  additional fiat or sharp consequent to a new key require a
  tone a comma higher or           lower; and to tune perfect, or in a
 small degree sharper, some of the fifths to meet such tones
 as are substitutes fur real ones.          This seems to me to be the
 best principle     for tempering our present scale; and any at
 tempt to reduce the anomalous tone B *, the result of the
 twelfth quint, or fifth, is much easier understood than ac
 complished.        To some theorists it is known, that by tuning
 all the fifths one-eleventh part of a comma flat with respect
 to that tone, it will be reduced so near to the original, C, as
 to be an imperceptible difference to the ear.             But what then
 will become of        the major thirds, and their replicates? The
 answer is ready: not one of them will be tolerably in tune;
 every one of them nearly a comma too sharp: shocking to
 a musical ear.        Chords, too, that most frequently occur iri
 duets and trios,      the semi- tones     major will be also nearly a
 comma too flat, and all the harmomcs disgusting.
     With respect to Mr. Farcy's observations on modulation,
 I  can only say,     that, since abrupt cadences are so frequent
in modern music, it would             be difficult to ascertain by any
calculation what keys are more or less used by the moderns 3
consequently,       their times of occurrence cannot, with                any
degree    of certainty,    be   known.     Modulation often         extend
ing    to  the   7th sharp and       7th flat,  I much wish to know
what temperament can reach              the one or the other, without
                                                       * ; for the

 12th quint* and the major thirds compared with the octave ;
that being the case, every attempt must be unavailing to
temper or assimilate two tones in direct opposition to each
other.     I am therefore fully persuadtd that the method I
have acted     upon is good, being nearly the same in its effect
as that  now    in general practice ; and unless an instrument
can be furnished with two scales, one with sharps and an
other with flats, there are very little hopes of ever melio
rating common keyed instruments : but I am of opinion
that such an instrument may be constructed without an ad
ditional key ; of which more hereafter.                  The   temperament
would then be by flattening all the fifths             of each scale   to the
7th sharp and 7th flat;          by which method the enharmonics,
or quarter-tones difference, will cease to be, and no other
substitutes but major and minor tones for each other will be
required ; for lliat tone which in one key is a major, will in
another be apposite for a minor tone, by the above mode of

  these metals, changed in its nature, as it were, like uranium*

     The production of muriatic acid and of         soda, by means
 of   the Galvanic   pile, in perfectly pure water, has not suc
 ceeded among us, although our piles are proper enough in
 point of the size of the metallic plates, and the number of
 the pairs.     Pure water is a very bad conductor ; the pile can
 hardly be made to act with it ; but if there is the least par
 ticle of any salt, the decomposition is more rapid, and the
 salt is decomposed ; the positive wire seizing the acid, and
 the negative the alkaline, base.        It seems probable to me
 that the gentlemen who thus compose the muriatic acid are
 led into an error by the decomposition         of muriate of soda,
 contained in their water, perhaps badly distilled.

                  relative to Pneumatic Medicine.
                  Cure   of Typhus  Fever by Yeast.
 j     DEAR SIR,
 An sending you        the detail of the case of my sister, whose
extraordinary    recovery   from the last stage of a violent typhus
fever reflects the highest honour on your skill and decision,
I   am induced     particularly to call your attention to the in
stantaneous salutary effects which arose from the exhibition
of yeast. The use of yeast in medicine has not, I believe,
till very lately been admitted into practice in this country ;
it is still by many looked upon as of dubious utility, and
by some is considered as wholly useless, or partially noxious.
It is not only from thh case, but from several others that I
have witnessed, that I am convinced of its highly beneficial
effects; and I have seen it successfully used in several places
in my native country, Holland. It was, as near as I can re
collect, in the year 1799, that .I first knew it exhibited.
                                                               This

                          On Pneumatic Medicine.                             309
This was       at Rotterdam,       and   occurred in     a case  of confluent
 small-pox,       the virulence     of the    fever attending which          was
 effectually and quickly subdued by this simple antiseptic.
 I mention this particularly because it has been held to be a
 very late discovery, and the honour of it has been ascribed
 to an ingenious clergyman             * of this country,         which    I  am
 anxious should be bestowed where it is most due, upon the
 practitioners of my native place. It may not be irrelevant
 here to remark,         that yeast is made up and preserved           in Hol
 land in almost a solid form, being of the consistence of
 putty, in which state it will keep, if the weather be mode
rately cool, for six weeks or longer ; and it is sent in bladders
from one place to another, so that no part of the country.,
or even a remote farm-house, need ever be in want of this
 necessary     article.     I know not the mode adopted to reduce
 the yeast to this consistency,           but I think it would be worth
 the trouble of inquiry, and adoption in this country, where
much inconvenience is sometimes felt from the liquid and
 diffused state in which aloue yeast is met with, and its great
liability to be spoiled.
    The simplicity and cheapness of this medicine, whilst it
is   a  recommendation to the intelligent physician, is an ob
stacle to its introduction         where apothecaries prescribe. What
can be more simple than the happy discovery of the effects
of cold effusion? or what more widely salutary than the in
estimable discovery of vaccination,              on which you, sir, have
so ably exercised         your pen   ?   And    yet we see that, from in
terested or other motives, these simple but effectual remedies
are scouted by a considerable number of practitioners.
    In addition      to   Mrs. W.'s     case,   whom you personally at
tended, I have      to add the case    of her youngest child, J 8 months
   * Mr. Cartwright, whose claim to the merit of the
                                                             discovery is rather
confirmed, than set aside, by M dit Moulin'* own statement. To the best of
his recollection it was in the year 1799 that he first knew yeast exhibited as a
medicine in Holland ; but Mr. Cartwright's discovery was some years earlier.
I cannot at the present moment liy my hands on any document ascertaining
the precise date, but I find it referred to in Dr. Beddoes's Considerations on
Factitious Air, part iii. published in 1795, p. 61. This honour of the disco
very must therefore still remain with Mr. Cartwright       Edit.

*
              Observations on these Cases by         Dr. Thornton.
       1.  Lately,   a relation    of Mr. Sutherland,     the engraver, who
   was at the point of death in typhus fever, experienced a very
   unexpected change, from my ordering the administration of
   yeast.
       2. In addition,       in this case,    I ordered   water impregnated
   with Jixed air, which was given with some port wine, and
   proved very efficacious.
       3. The yeast being; from the baker's, the bitter principle
   is much washed out by means of water; and I usually order
   a table- spoonful every three hours, and vegetable food in the
   interval, with porter.
       4. The bowels must be kept open with a few grains of
   calomel at first, and afterwards each evening, unless re
   lieved in the course of the day.
       5. Bark and serpentaria, a scruple of the former to half
   « scruple of the latter, may be usefully added to the yeast;
   but I have been equally successful in numberless cases with
   out any such addition.
       6. The rationale of the operation of yeast from the fixed
    air it contains, has been before explained.
                                                                  XLV.   On

Necessity of a sufficient Proportion of Water, with supersa
  turated Carbonate of Potash, in order that the Potash may
     be   completely disengaged by Means                            of Lime.
JLr must          have been observed that, in the first article quoted
in    thepreceding section, it has been prescribed to mix the
potash with double its weight of lime, while in the second
article no more than one-half is demanded ; it is true, that
Jess is required for the truly neutral carbonate of potash, be
cause it contains a less quantity of alkali, and because the
 water of crystallization is here in greater proportion than in
the supersaturated carbonate of potash; but if we consider
that the richest in alkali (being that which is obtained from
cream of tartar) absorbs only 0'72 of its weight in sulphuric
acid, while the quantity absorbed by the carbonate is 0-50,
we must admit that the proportions indicated in the two
cases are no longer relative to each other.
     On     the    other hand, numerous experiments, made on a
large scale, have constantly proved to me that four-tenths
of lime are sufficient to take off the carbonic acid from the
best      potash     of commerce           ;   How happens
                                            therefore, that             it,
twenty tenths have been prescribed, and still fears enter
tained that the potash was not perfectly caustic      shall                         ?   I
now   show that this fear appears well founded, so long as
the following observation of mine   unknown        have ascer
                                                           is             :   I
tained that, whatever be the proportion of the lime to the
supersaturated carbonate of potash,   the proportion of water  if
to this salt          is   not   as seven to         one, there will be             a   quantity
of carbonate not decomposed, and proportionate to the de
ficit of water, in the seven parts which are strictly necessary.
Besides,        if   we consult      the tables of Bergman                     as   to the re-
                                               U   4                                    spective

ipective quantities of carbonic acid which are found in the
supersaturated carbonate of potash and in the carbonate of
Jime, we shall   see that four-tenths  of lime must be always
sufficient for taking up all the carbonic acid contained in any
given quantity of the best potash of commerce.
   But here is a double experiment, which we may verify :
Take of quicklime,                 4   parts;       of white   potash     of Russia,   10
parts     ;                      slake the lime with a portion
              pure water, 70 parts             :
of    the water, and dissolve the potash in the remainder: af
terwards mix the whole, boil it for a few minutes, then
allow it to cool, and restore the whole of the 24 parts, which
may have been diminished by the slaking of the lime and the
ebullition; mix          the           water very minutely; allow the
                                   added
whole to subside, and decant             a little of the liquor: you will
find, upon trying            it,
                               that no precipitate     formed  isthe lime    in
water, and that         it   makes no efflorescence with the acids.
     In           place, take the same proportions of lime
          the second
and   potash, but  add only 50 parts of water to      then try             it;
the liquor which will result from this, and you will find that
it   occasions precipitate in lime water and an effervescence
                   a
with the acids. Finally, add 20 additional parts of water to
the first 50, and mix the whole carefully    the liquor, when    :
decanted, will occasion neither precipitate nor effervescence:
in   a word, the alkali will have become caustic inconsequence
of   the extraction of all its carbonic acid.
.   I    am inclined to think     this observation may be use*
                                             that
fully applied to the caustification of soda.

     We now      clearly the reason why we cannot obtain
                  see                                                                  a

                                       if  sufficient quantity  a
of water to the mixture of lime and supersaturated carbonate
of potash.   Although    might be thought we have used too
                                       it
much  lime already, yet we must put still more into the mix>.
ture; but as    might become too thick, we are under the
                   it
necessity of adding      new portion of water, which alone
                                   a
completes the caustification, although this has been, never
theless, attributed to the pew addition of lime.
                                                                                  lastly,

                    Oti the Alkabies   of Commerce.                  3 13
     Lastly, we see the reason why from a mixture of lime
.and of supersaturated        carbonate .of potash, with too little
water, the first lixivium, which may be filtered, will be effer
vescent, while that which may be obtained from washings,
i.e. by the addition of a new quantity of water, will come
-off entirely caustic.
      These alternatives might take place upon the execution of
the second of the processes, already quoted, of M. Fourcroy,
 because the proportion of water is then indeterminate; while
 in the first process, it it     be equal to eight or ten times the
 total weight of the supersaturated carbonate of potash and
 lime, it is evident that we ought consequently to obtain
 potash totally deprived of carbonic acid, if we have never,
 by the ebullition prescribed of two or         three hours,     reduced
 the proportion of water       to a less quantity than seven times
 the weight of the supersaturated          carbonate of potash : for
  my own part, I am convinced that an ebullition of a few
  minutes is at all times sufficient.
    Potash exists in    all Lime which is burnt     by a Wood      Fire.
      I  shall now proceed to announce          some facts connected
  with    the preceding observations.
      So long ago as the year 1795, my brother and I observed
  that lime, when burnt by means of wood, contained potash :
  this will not appear surprising when we consider the great
  lightness    of some    particles of ashes, which may be called
 Jiowers of     ashes :  there is no wood fire, let it be ever so
  small or moderate, that does not emit these flowers, and we
  see them attached to the kitchen utensils which are heated
   upon    a wood fire.    Their alkaline property will       be evident
   if  we first moisten the    tip  of the finger with    a little saliva,
   and afterward* lay it gently upon the vessels        to which these
   flowers are attached.       On afterwards applying      the   finger to
   the tongue, a very     decided alkaline taste will      he perceived.
   It  may be easily conceived, therefore, that in a violent fire,
   such   as that of a lime-kiln, the current    of air which traverses
   it carries  these light   ashes through    the  pieces of calcareous
   stones,     The earthy   part  of these ashes stops at the exterior
                                                                         of

of   the pieces   of limestone, which contract           a colour more     or
 less gray ;    while the potash going really into vapours, from
 the violence of the fire, passes into the interior of the stone,
 which, after being burnt, remains very white. We carefully
detached and analysed a great quantity of this external mat
 ter, and we there found the exact proportion of potash which
existed in the whole mass         of the pieces : this proportion was
nearly a 5-100dth of the weight of the lime.
    Chemists who may repeat our experiments will find in
lime more or less potash than thequantity above announced;
it must vary according to circumstances, and particularly
from    the nature   of  the wood employed in burning the lime.'
 Some chemical Anomalies          clearly explained by the Pretence
    of  Potash in Lime, and the Necessity of previously wash-
    ing  the   Lime, or of employing, in chemical Experiments
    and medical Preparations, Lime burnt with Pit Coal.
    By this    mean3 we may consequently explain the pretended
decomposition       of  a  very small quantity        of muriate of soda
operated      by  a very   great   quantity of lime       ; an error    into
-which the immortal          Scheele has fallen,        and   in which he
has been      followed by some      of our most        celebrated    French
chemists *.
    Some chemists have also been led into error upon mixing
sulphate of soda and lime.
    This   also explains the disputes among the chemists              of the
Academy of Sciences           (and  which     are  contained    in  the me
moirs of that learned body about the commencement of the
last century) upon a salt which some of them said was found
in lime, while others denied its existence entirely.
    Thence proceeds the well-founded idea of a property pe
culiar to the first water drawn off lime ; a property which
has been improperly          contested, and which cannot exist in
second lime water.
   * I do not mean, however, to deny that in some particular cases lime can
decompose the muriate and the sulphate of soda ; I merely insist that we may
be allowed to doubt it, provided we are not previously certain that the lime
mixed with the one or other of these salts did not contain potash.
                                                                        This

    This is     the reason why some sugar-refiners take great pains,
and expend         a great    deal     of money, for           a   first lime water,
which they might obtain by a little potash and lime.
  Lime water is recommended by some oculists : it is for
them to consider whether it is proper that it should contain
caustic potash, i. e. the caustic stone. This observation is
equally applicable to the internal use of lime water, pre
scribed by some physicians.
   In chemical experiments, therefore, such as making the
precipitate and sulphuret of lime, &cc., we must employ
lime burnt with coal, or it must be washed                           if it   has been
burnt with wood.
                 Origin of Natural Soda,             as   it   is called.
    The    efflorescences     of carbonate of
                                          found under the soda,
arches of the Pont-neuf, at Paris; those of the cellars at
Dieppe and other maritime places, are no longer objects of
astonishment.    A few years ago, when at Dieppe, I had
occasion to ascertain the origin of these efflorescences mixed
with sulphate of soda.   I descended into the cellar, under
the kitchen,        of my    paternal      residence, where in my infancy
I   had   seen     the   linen    of   a   numerous family washed. The
arch      of this cellar         had    been
                                   formerly plastered.   The
greatest   part of this plaster was noiv detached; but where
it still remained there was sulphate of soda, while beside it
there was only carbonate  of soda.   The origin of these two
salts was no longer  a mystery  to me ; for, independently of
the potash existing in the lime of the vault, the leys, when
the linen     washed, had penetrated the masonry; they
                 was
had there met with kitchen salt, which had been conse
quently decomposed; hence the carbonate of soda.        This
last, wherever it found sulphate of lime, had given place to
the formation of sulphate of soda.
   It often requires but a slight degree of reflection, upon all
the circumstances which accompany results most extraor
dinary in appearance, in order to explain the most striking
contrasts ; and for this purpose a great number of facts, hi
therto    ill   explained, must be reviewed.

 First Indication of         the  Mineralogical Inquiries     necessary  t»
                be made as to the      Existence    of Potash.
    In    an   essay upon the art of making saltpetre, which              I
 presented to the National Institute several years ago, I ex
 plained the origin of what is called natural soda, and I took
that occasion to inquire what became of the potash confined
in the bowels of the earth. About a year afterwards M. Klap-
roth discovered it in several volcanic productions ; and hit
discovery was soon confirmed by M. Vauquelin.                    It is pe
culiarly gratifying to me to have suggested the idea              of these
useful researches.
                       Probable Origin     of Natrum.
    I am     strongly    inclined    to think that the natrum of the
lakes in Egypt         and other places owes its origin to the de
composition of the muriate of soda by potash, which is one
of the products of the disorganization of vegetables ; for the
shores of the six lakes of Egypt, and the adjacent soils, are
covered      with jonquils and roses, winch must annually fur
nish plenty of potash.           It would be easy to verify this ex
planation by experiments, which promise more success than
those which        have    been made with        other views.    To con
clude   :  the explanation       which I thus      gave,  previous to the
late   memorable travels          of  several   of  our learned men in
Egypt,      before   it be confirmed,       would    require us to prove
the coexistence         of  the muriate     of   potash along with tho
other salts, in the lakes        of natrum     and in the waters of the
Nile.
XLVI.       Report  of the Royal College of Physicians of London
   on Vaccination.          Printed by Order of the House of Com
   mons,      dated 8th    July   1807.
 JL HE Royal College of Physicians of London, having re
ceived his majesty's commands, in compliance with an ad
dress from the house of commons
                                              " to inquire into the state
of vaccine inoculation in the united kingdom,              to report their
                                                                  opinion

opinion and observations upon that practice, upon the evi
dence which has been adduced in its support, and upon the
causes which have hitherto retarded its general adoption,"
have   applied themselves     diligently  to the   business referred
to them.
    Deeply impressed with the importance of an inquiry
which equally involves the lives of individuals and the
public prosperity, they have made every exertion to inves
tigate the subject fully and impartially.       In aid of the know
ledge   and   experience   of  the  members   of  their own body,
they have applied separately      to each of  the licentiates  of the
college; they have corresponded with the Colleges            of Phy
sicians of Dublin and Edinburgh ; with the Colleges           of Sur
geons   of London, Edinburgh,       and Dublin ; they have called
upon the societies established     for vaccination, for an account
of their practice,   to what extent it has been carried on, and
what has been the result of their experience ; and they have,
 by public notice, invited individuals to contribute whatever
information    they had severally collected. They have in con
sequence been furnished with a mass of evidence, communi
 cated with the greatest readiness and candour, which ena
bles them to speak      with confidence upon all the principal
 points referred to them.
    T. During eight years, which have elapsed since Dr. Jenner
 made his discovery public, the progress of vaccination            has
 been rapid, not only in all parts of the united kingdom,          but
 in every quarter of the civilized world. In the British islands
 some hundred thousands have been vaccinated ; in our pos
 sessions  in the East Indies upwards of 800,000       ; and  among
 the nations   of Europe   the practice has become general. Pro
 fessional men have submitted it to the fairest trials, and the
 public have, for the most part, received it without prejudice.
 A  few, indeed, have stood forth the adversaries of vaccina
 tion on the same grounds as their predecessors who opposed
 the inoculation    for the small-pox, falsely led by hypothe
 tical reasoning in the investigation of a subject which must
 be supported or rejected upon facts and observation only.
 With   these few exceptions, the testimony in favour         of vac
 cination   has  been   most strong and satisfactory;        and   the
                                                             practice

the united kingdom.
   II.      The College of Phvsicians,
                                     in giving their observa-
tions and opinions    on the practice of vaccination, think                           it
right to premise, that they advance nothing but what     sup                   is
ported       by
           the multiplied and unequivocal evidence which has
been brought before them, and they have not considered any
facts    as proved            but what have    been     stated from actual ob.r
servation.
   Vaccination appears to be in general perfectly safe   thf                     ;
instances to the contrary being extremely rare. The disease
excited       byslight, and seldom prevents those under
                   it
                   is                                                                 it
from        following their ordinary occupations.                     It   has      been
communicated    with safety to pregnant women, to children
during dentition, and     their earliest infancy
                                   in               in all which  ;
respects     it
          possesses  material  advantages  over  inoculation  for
the small-pox             ;   which, though productive of
                                                        disease ge-
                                                                  a
ncrally mild,         yet sometimes  occasions alarming symptoms,
and    is   ina     few cases fatal.
   The security derived from vaccination against                       the small
pox,    not absolutely perfect,
        if                      as nearly so as can perhap*
                                              is
be expected from any human discovery    for amongst several
                                                        ;
hundred thousand cases, with the results of which the col
lege have been made acquainted, the number of alleged
failures has been surprisingly small, so much so, as to form
certainly no reasonable objection to the general adoption of
vaccination    for ;appears that there are not nearly so many

                   in a   an equal number of persons inoculated for the
are deaths
small-pox.    Nothing can more clearly demonstrate the su
periority of vaccination over the inoculation of the smalls
pox, than this consideration     and      ;   most important
                                                   it   is
                                                        a
fact, which has  been confirmed  in the course of this inquiry,
that in almost every case where the small-pox has succeeded
vaccination, whether               by
                          inoculation or                    by

                           On Vaccination.                         Sig
remarkably mild, as if the small-pox had been deprived, hy
the previous vaccine disease, of all its usual malignity.
   The testimonies before the College of Physicians are very
decided in declaring, that vaccination does less mischief lo
the constitution,     and less frequently gives rise to other dis
eases,  than  the  small -pox, either natural or inoculated.
    The college feel themselves called upon to state this
itrongly, because it has been objected to vaccination, that
it produces new, unheard-of, and monstrous diseases.                Of
•uch assertions no proofs have been produced, and, after
diligent inquiry, the college believe them to have been
either the inventions of designing, or the mistakes of igno
rant, men.     In  these respects then, in its mildness, its safety,
and its consequences, the individual may look for the pecu
liar advantages of vaccination. The benefits which flow from
it to society are infinitely more considerable ; it spreads no
infection, and can be communicated only by inoculation.
It is from a consideration of the pernicious effects of the
 small-pox, that the real value of vaccination is to be esti
 mated.    The natural small-pox has been supposed to destroy
a sixth part of all whom it attacks ; and that even by inocu
lation, where that has been general in parishes and towns,
about one in 300 has usually died.             It is not sufficiently
known, or not adverted to, that nearly one-tenth, some
 years more than one- tenth, of the whole mortality in Lon
 don, is occasioned by the small-pox; and however benefi
 cial the inoculation of the small-pox may have been to in
 dividuals, it appears to have kept- up a constant source of
 contagion, which has been the means of increasing the
 number of deaths by what is called the natural disease.              It
 cannot be doubted that this mischief has been extended by
 the inconsiderate manner in which great numbers of per
 sons, even since the introduction          of vaccination, are still
 every year    inoculated    with   the  small-pox, and afterwards
 required to attend two or three times a week at the places
 of inoculation, through      every stage  of their illness.
    From this, then,     the   public   are to expect the great and
 uncontroverted     superiority   of vaccination,     that it commu
                                                                nicates

   820                        On Vaccination.
   nicates no casual      infection, and, while it is a protection to
   the individual,   it is not prejudicial to the public.
      III. The College of Physicians, in reporting their ob
  servations and opimons on the evidence adduced in support
  of vaccination, feel themselves authorized to state, that a
  body of evidence so large, so temperate, and so consistent,
  was perhaps never before collected upon any medical ques
  tion. A discovery so novel, and to which there was nothing
  analogous known in nature, though resting on the experi
 mental observations of the inventor, was at first received
 with diffidence    :  it was   not, however, difficult for others to
  repeat his experiments,      by which the truth of his observa
 tions was confirmed,        and the doubts of the cautious were
 gradually dispelled by extensive experience.           At the com
 mencement of the practice, almost all that were vaccinated
 were afterwards submitted to the inoculation of the small
 pox ; many underwent this operation a second, and even a
 third time, and the uniform success of these trials quickly
 bred confidence in the new discovery           But the evidence of
 the security derived from vaccination against the small -pox
 does not rest alone upon those who afterwards underwent
 variolous inoculation,      although amounting to many thou
 sands;    for it appears, from numerous observations commu
 nicated to the college, that those who have been vaccinated
 are equally secure      against the contagion of epidemic small
 pox.     Towns indeed, and districts of the country, in which
vaccination had been general, have afterwards had the small
pox prevalent on all sides of them without suffering from
the contagion.        There are also in the evidence a few exam
ples   of epidemic small -pox having         been  subdued by a ge
neral vaccination.        It will not, therefore, appear extraordi
nary, that many who have communicated their observations
should state, that though at first they thought unfavourably
or the practice, experience had now removed all their doubts.
     Jt has been already mentioned that the evidence is not
universally favourable, although it is in truth nearly so; for
there are a few who entertain sentiments differing widely
from     those  of  the great    'majority of their brethren.    The
                                                            college,

                           On Vaccination,                     321
  college, therefore, deemed it their duty, in a particular man
  ner, to inquire upon what grounds and evidence the oppo-
  sers of vaccination rested their opinions.         From personal
  examination,    as well   as  from their writings, they endea
  voured to learn the full extent and weight of their objec
  tions.   They found them without experience in vaccination,
  supporting their opinions by hearsay information and hy
 pothetical reasoning, and, upon investigating the facts which
 they advanced, they found them to be either misapprehended
 or misrepresented ; or that they fell under the description of
 cases   of imperfect small-pox, before noticed, and which      the
 college have endeavoured      fairly to appreciate.
     The practice of vaccination is but of eight years standing,
 and its promoters, as well as opponents, must keep in      mindi
 that  a  period so short is too limited to ascertain every point,
 or to bring the art to that perfection of which it may be ca
 pable.    The truth of this will readily be admitted by those
 acquainted with the history of inoculation for the small
 pox.     Vaccination is now, however, well understood, and
 its character accurately described. Some deviations from
 the usual course have     occasionally occurred, which the au
 thor of the practice has called spurious cow-pox, by which
 the public have been misled, as if there were a true and a
 false cow-pox ; but it appears that nothing more was meant
than to express irregularity or difference from that common
form and progress of the vaccine pustule from which its
efficacy is inferred.    Those who perform vaccination ought
therefore to be well instructed,        and should have watched
with the greatest care the regular progress of the pustule,
and    learnt the most proper time for taking the matter.
There is little doubt that some of the failures are to be im
puted to the inexperience      of the early vaccinators, and it is
not unreasonable to expect that further observations will yet
suggest many improvements that will reduce the number
of anomalous cases, and furnish the means of determining,
with greater precision, when the vaccine disease has been
effectually received.
    Though the College of Physicians have confined them
selves in estimating the evidence to such facts as have oc-
    Vol. 88. No.   112. Sept. 1807.       X                curred

 322                        On Vaccination.
  curred in their own country, because the accuracy of them
  could best be ascertained, they cannot be insensible to the
  confirmation    these receive from the reports    of the successful
 introduction of vaccination, not only into every part of Eu
 rope, but throughout the vast continents of Asia and Ame
 rica.
    IV.  Several    causes have had a partial operation in retard
 ing the general adoption of vaccination ; some writers have
 greatly undervalued the security it affords, while others have
 considered it to be of     a  temporary nature only; but if any
 reliance is to be placed     on the statements which have been
 laid before the college, its power of protecting the human
 body from the small-pox, though not perfect indeed, is
 abundantly sufficient to recommend it to the prudent and
 dispassionate, especially as the small-pox, in the few in
stances   where it has subsequently occurred, has been gene
 rally mild and transient. The opinion that vaccination af
 fords but  a  temporary security, is supported by no analogy
 in nature, nor by the facts which have hitherto occurred.
 Although     the experience     of vaccine inoculation   be only  of
 a few years,   yet the same disease,     contracted by the milkers
of cows, in some districts has been long enough known to
ascertain that in them, at least, the (.insusceptibility of the
 small-pox contagion does not wear out by time.             Another
 cause is,  the   charge against vaccination of producing va
rious new diseases of frightful and monstrous appearance.
    Representations of some of these have been exhibited in
prints in a way to alarm the feelings of parents, and to in
fuse dread and apprehension into the minds of the unin
formed.      Publications with such representations have been
widely circulated ; and though they originate either in gross
ignorance or wilful misrepresentation, yet have they lessened
the confidence of many, particularly of the lower classes, in
yaccination : no permanent effects, however, in retarding the
progress    of vaccination      need  be apprehended from such
causes,   for,  as   soon as the   public shall view them coolly
and without surprise, they will excite contempt and not fear.
    Though the College of Physicians are of opinion that the
progress   of vaccination   has been retarded    in a few places  by
            4                                                     the

 the above causes,      yet they conceive      that   its  general  adop
 tion has been       prevented    by causes far more powerful,         and
 of a nature \vhollydiffcrent. The lower orders of society
 can hardly be induced to adopt precautions against evils
 which may be at a distance ; nor can it be expected from
 them,   if these   precautions are attended with expense.            Un
 less, therefore, from the immediate dread of epidemic small
 pox, neither vaccination nor inoculation appear at any time
to have been        general, and     when the cause        of terror   has
 passed by, the public have relapsed again into a state of in
difference and apathy, and the salutary practice has come
to a stand.      It is not easy to suggest a remedy for an evil so
deeply   imprinted in human nature.            To inform and instruct
the public mind may do much, and it will probably be found
that the progress of vaccination in different parts of the
united kingdom         will  be in proportion      to that   instruction.
Were encouragement- given            to vaccination, by offering it to
the poorer classes without        expense,    there is little doubt but
it would in time supersede the inoculation for the small-pox,
and thereby various sources of variolous infection would be
cut off; but till vaccination becomes general it will be impos
sible to prevent the constant recurrence of the natural small
pox by means of those who are inoculated, except it should
appear proper to the legislature to adopt, in its wisdom, some
measure     by which those who still,       from terror or prejudice,
prefer the    small-pox     to the vaccine disease,        may, in thus
consulting the gratification of their own feelings, be pre
vented from doing mischief to their neighbours.
    From the whole of the above considerations the College
of Physicians feel it their duty strongly to recommend the
practice of vaccination.        They have been led to this con
clusion by no preconceived opinion, but by the most un
biassed judgment, formed from an irresistible weight of evi
dence    which     has been    laid before them.          For when the
number,      the   respectability,   the disinterestedness,      and   the
extensive experience of its advocates,          is compared with the
feeble   and   imperfect     testimonies   of  its  few opposers ; and
when it is considered that many who were once adverse to
vaccination, have been convinced           by further trials, and are
                                   X  2                              now

now      to be ranked among   its warmest supporters, the truth
seems      to be established as firmly as ihe nature of such a
question admits          ;    so that the College         of Phy/ioians conceive
the      public   may reasonably look forward, with some degree
of hope,      to the lime when all opposition shall cease, and the
general concurrence of mankind                      shall at length be able to
put an end to the ravages at least,                 if not to the existence, -jf

-L IIP. practice of vaccination was introduced into this city
about the beginning of the year 1801, and appears to have
made       inconsiderable            progress at first.       A variety of   causes
operated       to retard       its   general    adoption,     amongst which the
novelty of        the practice,         and     the extraordinary effects attri
buted to vaccination, would naturally take the lead.
  Variolous inoculation had been long, almost                                exclu

medical attendants in families,                  and especially employed ia
the diseases        of children,          their opinions had greater effect
upon the minds of parents. The small-pox is rendered a
much less formidable disease in this country by the fre

    tion was established under the patronage of the earl                            of Hard-
    wicke,      and it is from this period           that we may date the ge
    neral introduction        of vaccination into this city,                 and through
    out all parts of Ireland.
       The success of the institution in forwarding the new prac
    tice is to be attributed, in a great measure, to the respecta
    bility of     the gentlemen who
                                  superintend    and to the dili    it,

    made in extending vaccination,     your committee refer to the
    reports of the Cow-pox Institution for the last two years,

    sorting to the institution as usual. The correspondence of
    the institution appears to be very general throughout every
    part of Ireland, and      the accounts received, as well from
                                 by
    medical      practitioners   as    others, the success                 of vaccination
    seems to be   uniform'and effectual. At the present period,
.   in the opinion of your committee, ihere are few individuals
    in any branch of the profession who oppose the practice of
    vaccination in this part          of his majesty's dominions.

of discriminating      between   small-pax   and    other eruptions,
no case having come to the knowledge           of your committee,
duly authenticated by respectable and competent judges,              of
genuine small-pox succeeding the regular vaccine disease.
    The practice of vaccination becomes        every day more ex
tended   ;  and, when it is considered that the period at which
it came into general use in Ireland is to be reckoned from
so late a date, your committee is      of opinion that it   has made
already    as rapid a progress as could be expected.

       GENTLEMEN,                               November 25, 1806.
 J.  HE Royal     College of Physicians    of Edinburgh have but
little opportunity    themselves   of making observations on vac
cination,     as that practice is' entirely conducted     by surgeon
 apothecaries, and other medical practitioners           not of their
college, and as the effects produced by it are so inconsidera
ble and slight, that the aid of a physician is never required.
    The college kuow that in Edinburgh it is universally ap
proved of by the profession, and by the higher and middle
ranks of the community, and that it has been much more
generally adopted by the lower orders of the people than
ever the inoculation for small-pox was, and they believe the
same to obtain all over Scotland.
    With    regard to any causes which have hitherto prevented
its general adoption, they are acquainted with none, except
the negligence or ignorance of parents among the common
people, or their mistaken ideas of the impropriety or crimi
nality of being accessary      to the   production    of any   disease

    The evidence in favour of vaccination appeared to the
Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh so strong and
decisive, that in May last they spontaneously and unani
mously elected Dr. Jenncr an honorary fellow of their col
lege, — a mark of distinction which they very rarely confer,
and which they confine almost exclusively to foreign phy
sicians of the first eminence.
    They did this with     a  view to publish their opinion with
regard   to vaccination,      and in testimony of their conviction
of  the immense benefits which          have  been, and which will
in future be derived to the world, from inoculation for the
cow-pox, and as a mark of their sense of Dr. Jenncr's very
great merits and     ability in introducing      and   promoting       this
invaluable practice.       ,

  a  view   of collecting evidence, they submitted          to the consi

   vaccinated is 164,381.
      The number of        cases  in which small-pox        had   followed
   ^accination is 56.
      The board think it proper to remark under this head,
  ,that in the enumeration of cases in which small-pox has
   succeeded   vaccination, they have included none but those in
   which the subject       was vaccinated by the surgeon reporting

   are, eruptions of the skin in 66 cases, and inflammation               of
  the arm in 24 instances, of which three proved fatal.
      Vaccination, in the greater number of counties from
   which reports have been received, appears to be increasing ;
   it may be proper however to remark, that in the metropolis
  it  is on the decrease.
      The principal     reasons assigned    for the decrease are    t

    1 HE practice of vaccine inoculation, both in private, and
  at the Vaccine Institution established here in 1801, is in
  creasing so rapidly, that for two or three years past, the
   small pox has been reckoned rather a rare occurrence, even
  amongst the lower orders of the inhabitants           of this city, un
  less   in  some   particular quarters about twelve months ago;
 and, among the higher ranks of the inhabitants, the disease
 is unknown.                             i
      The members of the Royal College of Surgeons have
 much pleasure in reporting, that, as far as their experience
 goes, they have no doubt of the permanent security against
 the small pox which is produced by the constitutional af
 fection of the cow pox ; and that such has hitherto been their
 success in vaccination, as also to gain for it the confidence
 of the public,      insomuch that they have not been required,
 for some years past, to inoculate any person with small pox
 who had not previously undergone the inoculation with the
 cow pox.
     The members of the royal college have met with no oc
currence in their practice of cow pox inoculation which
could operate in their minds to its disadvantage, and they
beg leave particularly to notice, that they have seen no in
stance of obstinate eruptions, or of new and dangerous dis
eases,      which they could attribute to the introduction among
mankind of this mild preventive of small pox.                 The Royal
College of Surgeons know of no causes which have                 hitherto
retarded the adoption of vaccine inoculation here               ; on the
contrary, the practice has become general within this city:
and from many thousand packets of vaccine matter having
been sent by the members of the Royal College, and the Vac
cine Institution here,       to all parts  of  the country,   the Royal
College have reason to believe that the practice has been as
generally adopted throughout this part of the United King-

       SIR,                                      Dublin, Feb. 4th, 1807.
  JAM directed to transmit to you the inclosed report of a
committee of the College of Surgeons in Ireland, to whom
was referred     a letter from the Royal College of Physicians in
London,      relative to the present state of vaccination in this
part   of the United Kingdom ; and         to state, that the College
of Surgeons will be highly gratified       by more frequent oppor
tunities of corresponding with the English College of Phy
sicians on any subject which may conduce to the advance
ment of science, and the welfare of the public.                           «

    lioklen at their Theatre,      on Tuesday the 13th day of         Ja
    nuary 1807 ; Francis        M'Evoy,   esq. president.
    Mr. Johnson       reported  from the committee,     to whom was
referred    a letter   from the College of Physicians, London,
 relative to the present state of vaccination in the United
Kingdom, &c. &c. that they met, and came to the follow
 ing resolutions :
    That it appears to this committee, that inoculation with
vaccine infection is now very generally adopted by the sur
gical practitioners in this part of the United Kingdom, as a
 preventive of small pox.
    That it appears to this committee,        that from the 25th day
       * From the Houte of Commons printed Report of 8th July  1807.
                                                                       Of

   of March      1800 to the 25th        of November 1806,           11,504 per
   sons have been inoculated with vaccine infection at the Dis
   pensary for Infant Poor, and 2,831 at the Cow Pox Insti
  tution, making a total of 14,335, exclusive of the number
  inoculated at Hospitals and other places, ..where no registry
 is made and preserved.
      That it   is the opinion     of this committee, that the cow pox
 has been found to be         a mild disease, and rarely attended            with
 danger,      or  any alarming symptom, and that the few                    cases
 of small pox which have occurred in this country, after                     sup
 posed vaccination,          have been satisfactorily proved to              have
 arisen from accidental circumstances, and cannot be attri
 buted to the want of efficacy in the genuine vaccine infec
 tion    as a  preventive of small pox.
      That it is the opinion of this committee,                that the causes
which       have hitherto     retarded      the   more general adoption of
vaccination in Ireland, have, in a great measure, proceeded
 from the prejudices of the lower classes of the people, and
 the interest of some irregular practitioners.

Certain          bodies of a very great tenuity,           and the thickness
of which       varies progressively throughout            their whole extent,
exhibit,     as is well  known, a set of colours shaded in various
and sometimes in very brilliant hues. It is not my inten
tion to describe here these kinds of colours, and far less to
dispute their peculiarities, so admirably described by New
ton.      I  shall merely endeavour to draw some inferences upon

the origin of these colours, to establish their Comparison
with those owing to absorption, and finally I shall endeavour
to ascribe to their true cause some phaenomena, which to
this hour have been differently explained.
   I shall point out, in the first place, the principal effects
upon which it is important for my purpose that the attention
of my readers should be fixed.
    When the light falls upon the                  very    thin      and slender bo-
die's which yield these colours,
   1st.      At      the spots where       the colours          arise upon the thin
body, each complex bundle of rays, or, if you please, the
white light, is divided into two portions, in a variable manner,
and one         of them      is reflected    while the other cannot come
out of        the substance except by transmission.
   2d. This           division    varies according to a law depending
upon the thickness of               the body, its density, and the incli
nation of the luminous rays.
  3d. Each ray acts in particular                  as   if endowed        with the sin
gular property of having fits of                  easy reflection at periodical
intervals, and fits of easy transmission at other intervals, al
ternate with the first : these various results are equally be
yond all dispute.
  But whence comes this disposition of the rays ? —Newton
considered it as inherent in the rays themselves, not only in
that part of their transmission comprised between the two
extreme surfaces of the body which they traverse, but also
over the whole of the progress of these rays, from the mo
ment of their first emission from a luminous body *.   Here
 there is a kind       of hidden cause, of which it seems very dif
 ficult to        forma precise idea: some distinguished philoso
 phers have therefore testified much repugnance in admitting
 it.
    But Newton himself, at the end of his work, puts us in
 the right path when he asks, if it is not in virtue of a simi
 lar principle that the rays are reflected or refracted by bodies,
 and bent before they actually arrive at the bodies                         f.
       We     have much cause to regret that this great man has not

  334              Upon the variegated Colours            of Bodies
  treated the subject of inflexion with the same copiousness
 he has bestowed on his work upon coloured rings ; or even
 that he did not turn his attention to the deviation of light in
 the adjacency of bodies, before examining its changes of
 direction from the action of surfaces                : from these reflections
 he would        certainly    have drawn some very valuable conse
 quences.
     In fact, the greatest analogy exists between the phpeno-
 menaof inflexion around a small body, and those of reflexion
 or transmission, by means of thin bodies ; for the colours
 of    the fringes      in the one seem to follow the same law with
 that of the coloured rings in the others.                  And if this is not
 very perceptible with respect to the fringes adjacent to the
 shade     of a body of small diameter received into a dark room,
 this similitude becomes more evident with respect to the
 fringes produced by the light which passes between two bo
 dies very closely connected            ;  it is still more so in the course
 of coloured         images    formed       among the feathers of a quill,
 through which we look at the flame of a candle } and it is
also very manifestly recognised in bars seen by the eye, when
we place between us and the light, the texture of a piece of
 cloth, or a number of metallic wires placed close together,
as   in   the experiments       of M. Rittenhouse *.
     I   have myself found a method still               more proper for pro
ducing this resemblance.               For this purpose, I substitute in
place of the piece of cloth,              the black gauze called crape,     in
such      a  manner that      if in    a  dark place we observe a light a
little distant, by covering the eye with a black crape we see
this light surrounded by a number of rings very apparent,
and of very lively colours, shaded with the same hues with
those of the coloured rings of thin pellicles.
     If the flame of a candle is introduced into an aqueous va
pour,       a little   abundant,      where      it cannot be seen except
through this vapour, we see               the flame surrounded with rings
absolutely analogous to the preceding.                    I can imitate them
also in an easy way, by tarnishing with my breath a plate of
glass, which I immediately use for looking, either by re
flexion or by transmission, at the image of a luminous body.

The    coronae we sometimes see surrounding                  the sun and the
moon,      are probably phenomena of the same kind.
   In another place Newton speaks of undulated folds, like
those of an eel, which he supposes to be produced in the
rays, when they pass by the eds;es and sides of bodies *.                     I
think I can explain the formation of these folds, and the ne
cessity for their existence.
   With this view, I shall call the attention                of my  readers to
the very interesting         results of the       experiments of Newton
and S. Gravesande,           relative to inflexion      :  results so certain,
that surely no philosopher can raise any doubts against
them ; but it is nevertheless satisfactory to be able to prove
them ourselves, and to seize upon them with all their pecu
liarities,   as   I  had   the   advantage      of doing in      some experi
ments upon this very subject made at the house ofM. Tre-
mery, in concert with Messrs. Berthollet, sen. and jun.
These      experiments      I  have   detailed in a former part of my
work.
    From the action exercised upon the luminous rays by a
point or by the edge of any given body, we are, in my opi
nion, warranted in considering each molecule or parcel of
isolated matter       as enveloped with a double sphere of activity
relatively     to   the  light ; the one more interior, where the
rays are attracted by the body, the other more exterior,
where the rays are repelled.             But it will happen, in several
positions, that a ray coming to traverse the repulsive sphere,
will therein describe a convex curve on the side of the body,
that    if  it afterwards intersects           the   attractive   sphere, the
curve    of deviation will then         be concave with        respect to the
body, and that it will become a second time convex when
 the ray re-passes into the sphere of repulsion in order to
continue its route.           Here then is the commencement of the
 snaky movement, the folds              of which may         be multiplied   by
a  string of molecules.
    Will    this cause be sufficient for operating the access of
easy    reflexions    and transmissions of rays directed upon the
 surface of bodies ?
    The phenomena of colours, which                  we are here discussing,

336               Upon the variegated Colours                of Bodies
seem       to me to be explained                very naturally by this            method
uloue.   Nevertheless I restrict myself to presenting it as a
simple probability.   In order to leave nothing further to be
desired upon such a -proposition, it will certainly be necessa
ry to make    more profound examination of
                  a                              and particu        it,
larly to try  we can apply any calculation to it, for the pur
                 if
pose of seeing whether, from the double virtue, attractive
and  reputsive, attributed to each molecule of any body,                                    it
would be possible, in    given case, to deduce the movement
                                     a
of the luminous rays reflected, or pushed, sometimes in one
direction, and sometimes in another, conformably to the
flexions or transmissions operated    the pellicles.    by
   To conclude,        more important to the object
                           it   is                   have in                I
view to remark, that the colours resulting from the fits of
easy reflexions and transmissions,                   are produced equally, as
was clearly       seen      by   Mazeas,        between the elose connected
surfaces of two bodies, without any substance whatever be
ing between them * for instance, between two lenses, or
                                ;
two glasses applied against each other and placed under the
exhausted receiver of an air-pump.
  On the other hand, these colours do not always require                                    a
very minute separation of surfaces, since Newton himself
obtained coloured rings by the action of the two surfaces of
a concave glass mirror, three lines in thickness, and found
that these rings, with respect to thick plates, depended upon
the thickness, following the same law which he had laid
down with respect to thin platen and this he again con
                                                    ;
firmed by the observation of the rings                        upon   a    mirror only
one line thick        f-
    We      therefore, on referring to the various phenomena
           see
  have quoted, that the colours emitted          pellicle or thin
                                                              by

plate of glass, are as fugitive and independent of the colour
proper to the substance, as those of    thick mass of glass

that these kinds of colours may not even depend upon the
thickness of any substance, as when they arise in the inter
val of two close joined glasses, or in the fissures of certain
minerals     ;   that they have          the greatest    analogy with the co

                              threads,     themselves
such as in black gauze or metallic wire cloth ; and lastly,
that on going back to the action of one point, or of a single
material molecule upon the luminous fluid, we then find
the most probable origin of the modifications of the direc
tion of rays which twist or fold the molecules of bodies in
the various examples cited, and which being influenced dif*
ferently, each according to each species, escape by a different
final direction : whence results a variety of colours upon
these bodies, determined only by the number or distance of
their molecules,                and      without   any dependence                upon their
proper nature.
     Let     us now establish the parallel between these kinds of
colours,           of those of the molecules of bodies submitted
                  and
to       the laws of absorption.
     In     the first place, with respect to the latter, the luminous
bundles           are not bifurcated         as    they are with respect                  to the
former       :    the rays which           do not re-appear in a given                    direc
tion,       are not thrown out in another direction  ; they remain
absorbed          in the substance, even when the mass is perfectly
transparent.
   In the second place, the colours resulting from absorp
tion are sometimes owing to groups of rays very different
from those which tliin pellicles can furnish. For instance^
the latter never furnish colours composed like those                                 of   bodies
tinged violet by the oxide of manganese, nor like the blue                                     of
cobalt or of indigo.
  Besides, there is no relation between the colouring de
pending upon the thickness of any body, in the two kinds
of       phaenomeha.
     We may          assure ourselves    of this by a comparative exami
nation of my table               of the varieties of absorption *, and the
     Th!i table, which is described and explained in A preceding pin of th«

the colours of the rings *.
  In the third place, the colours of       the thinnest possible
pellicles have a very great liveliness ; those, on the contrary,
of the most intense coloured solutions arc imperceptible
under an equally small thickness.       It is for this reason that
the colouring of small plates of mica of an excessive tenuity
has no relation with the yellow colour of the mica in the
mass from which            these     leaves detached.
                                                 have  They

are at that time in every respect similarto fragments of the
most colourless glass blown into bubbles, nearly of an equal
tenuity, and when mixed together we should have no sign
by which to distinguish them.
  Thus glass, mica, or                any other substance,               which under
a great tenuity are decked    in the most brilliant colours, pass,
by increasing   in thickness,   to an absolutely colourless state,
or to a colour totally independent of those they exhibit when,
in a thin state.
   But, it will be said, in order to assimilate a coloured mass
to an assemblage of parcels of a determinate thickness, it is
also requisite that these parcels                be kept at a convenient di
stance from each other.
   In this     case,    I answer, you will             have a certain colour re
flected and another colour transmitted precisely complemen
tary to the first. Now, this double colouring never                            takes
place with respect to substances entirely diaphanous.
  The    examples         infusion of nephritic wood, and of
                         of   the
the precipitates of gold, are not applicable to this case, since
here, as I have previously shown, the colours reflected are
owing to molecules impermeable to light and disseminated
in a transparent liquid, and because we may alter the nature
of these molecules, or even have others of them in such a
manner        change the colour reflected, without there be
          as to
ing any change on that account in the colour transmitted.
  There has not hitherto been any case known, which per
mits us to consider a coloured botly perfectly transparent, or
even   dull,   as   composed        of parcels of       a determinate thickness,

  dependent upon the thickness of these elementary parts.
      In the fourth and last place, the colours of pellicles are iri
  certain cases variable by the inclinations of light and of the
  eye, and sometimes also by the influence of the mediums
 with which          we place      them in contact.         Nothing similar
  takes place      with respect to the colours peculiar to molecules :
 fixed and permanent, iii whatever direction we view them,
 they do not even change upon being introduced into                      a new
 limpid medium of a greater or less density.
     These,       in my mind, are enough of characteristic differ
 ences to authorise the opinion              that the colours of bodies in
 masses have not the same origin with those of thin pellicles :
 a conclusion        equally important with respect to its object in
 itself,    as   in respect to the disputes it still occasions among
 men of science*.

 LIII.     An Examination of what JEROME DE LALANDE has
     publisked, in his History of Astronomy for \ 806, con
     cerning Dr. HERSCHEL and his 40-feet Telescope:
                                To   Mr. TlllocL
 HSIRjAVING long        taken in your valuable philosophical          miscel
lany,     I   lately  met  with     the  article  called  "  The  History    of
Astronomy, by Jerome de Lalahde, for 1806," which has
a place      in your Magazine for          July last.    This is a new spe
cies of composition, which, it is well known, that author
for several years past had been fond of: a kind of annual
bulletin,       consisting of a great farrago of topics and titles
respecting the labours of his cotemporaries in astronomy
and its kindred sciences, all treated of in a very cursory man
lier, with strictures on their merits not unfrequently super-
added.
   • Sef , among others, in the second edition of the Elements of Dyeing, by
M.   Berthollet,    and in Haiiy's Treatise upon Physics (second edition), the
discussion! and the contrary opinions of these celebrated authors upon thif
Question.

3(40           Examination of Lalande's Remarks          on
     In thus flying,   every new year,     through such a variety of
 matter, and becoming as          it were a Historian on the wing,
 there is some danger however of losing that distinct discern
 ment of things below, which alone can bestow value on any
  such publication.      This may happen by soaring too high,
 or by skimming too rapidly when nearer the surface; but
 most    of all from that giddiness which sometimes           overtakes
 very good people, when, either in reality or in imagination,
 they are lifted up far above the level of their fellow-mortals.
     Such reflections, sir, spontaneously arose when, amongst
 the morsels of history above referred to, I perused the fol
 lowing paragraph concerning an excellent person, highly en
 titled to the regard of men of science, and who, by his ge
 nius and invincible perseverance, has so much enriched astro
 nomy, and raised the fame of this country,           by his manifold
  sublime discoveries in the heavens.
     In  page 129  of your Magazine for July last, the following
 passage makes     up a link in Lalande's History of Astronomy
 for  last year :
     " The 40-feet    telescope   of Mr. Herschel     has not yet fur
 nished the extraordinary results we expected from it.                 I
wrote to him that I was desirous of coming to England to
visit this prodigious instrument, as soon as he wrote me
that he had no objections: I have not yet received his an
swer.      As Mr. Herschel is now 68 years of age, I am afraid
he will not be able to satisfy himself,        and that he     will not
find   a successor capable      of terminating completely so diffi
cult an enterprise."
    Now, sir, to continue for a moment longer the former
allusion, I really should have expected, when so celebrated
and so unique an object came in sight, that it would have
arrested our historian in his airy career,       and have lured him
to hover a while     in its zenith,    that, by some competent ex
amination,     he might have      represented   it very differently in
his bulletin.     But in   place  of that,   he brushes away after a
short flourish, the evident tendency        of which is to spread the
belief, that Dr. Herschel       has  failed of success in construct
ing this noble instrument, so much exceeding all former ex
                           '
ample.
                                                                   The

                      Dr. Herschel's 4Q-feet                      Telescope.            341
  The proof too of this                      defeat,     as stated      in the paragraph,
turns, it should seem, on the circumstance                                of Dr. Herschel
having   made no reply to Mr. Lalande's letter.   But this
surely must be considered as a very summary, if not a cava
lier, way of establishing the conclusion.  Admitting that
Mr. Lalande, when inviting himself               telescope,        to see    the
meant to do so with that respect which was due, yet it must
be evident that he has been exceedingly unfortunate in the
manner     of his communication.                        By his own account of the
matter, he prescribed the very singular condition which was
to determine his journey to the telescope : namely, when
Dr. Herschel should write him that he had no objections
against his coming.     Now, certainly there was something
very ungracious   in so putting                        it,
                                    and which warranted the
inference of his prejudging Dr. Herschel's object, and of an
ticipating its failure, at the very time so much curiosity and
interest was displayed about      in his letter. it
     Under      these       circumstances,             it    is    most natural to sup
pose     that   Dr. Herschel's silence,                      if   the letter in question
ever reached         him,        proceeded       from no want of confidence in
his instrument,  but more or less from disgust, in conse
quence of the application having been made in    way so pe                       a
culiar and forbidding, as far as  could be construed.  it
   But further      comes in the next place to be particularly
                      :     it
remarked, that this disparagement of Dr. Herschel's 40-feet
telescope    very recent, notwithstanding many proofs of its
                is
utility and excellence have been published, many years ago,
in the London Philosophical      Transactions.   What then
must be thought of the article of the bulletin under review                               1
As the most favourable construction ought surely to be made,
it must therefore be supposed that the author had never seen,
or perused these volumes though they have    ;  wide circula                 a
tion wherever  science    cultivated. But such an omission
                                        is
necessarily implies that, in the present instance at least, the
historian had had     very imperfect knowledge of his sub
       otherwise,            it  is a
                                   that the paragraph would

have had        a    very    different complexion,                    by    doing justice to
Pr.    Herschel's labours.
     Indeed,    I      was so       puch surprised                at this untoward para-

 read and believedof the 40-feet telescope in the garden at
 Slough, that I had again recourse to the Philosophical
Transactions, in order to refresh my recollections about                                  it.
There we meet with accounts of Dr. Herschel's observations,
with     that telescope,        on the planet Saturn; 'on its ring; on
accurate measures             of the ring on its shadow on the body

its original     construction,        his consummate expe

rience and skill,    every thing relating to vision, pointed
                             in
out to him as an  acquisition well deserving of the most ar
duous pursuit.
  But his success in this               is         still more unquestion

which could never have so availed him had Mr. Lalande's
account of      it   been at all well founded.
    Some of these            shall now be quoted, that the
                              passages

their places."

  perfectly assured that the second is invisible, it becomes
  evident that Saturn has seven satellites. This new satellite
 is excessively small."
     These two new satellites he observed       many times after
 wards,     and  determined their periods, &c. round Saturn.
  In  another place we find the following passage :
                                                         "
     Philosophical Transactions for 1 800, page. 76 : — Oct. 10,
  1791-    I saw the fourth satellite and the ring of Saturn, in
 the 40-feet speculum, without an eye-glass.          The magnify
 ing power    on that occasion could not exceed 60 or 70 ; but the
 greater penetrating power made full amends for the lowness
 of the former, &c. Among other instances of the superior
 effects of penetration into space, I should mention the dis
 covery of an additional sixth satellite of Saturn, on the 28th
 August 1789, and of a seventh on the llth September, in
 the same year, which were first pointed out by this instru
 ment."
     Philosophical Transactions for 1800, page 77 : — "Nov. 3,

 was nearly the same size as a small fixed star, but here it is
 considerably larger than that star.
    "  Here the superior penetrating power of the 40-feet te
lescope showed itself on the 6th satellite of Saturn, which
is a very faint object, &c. &c."
    Philosophical Transactions for 1790, page 2: — " It may
appear remarkable that these satellites should have remained
so long unknown to us, when, for a century and an half past,
the planet to which they belong has been the object      of almost
every astronomer's curiosity, on account     of  the singular phe
nomena of the ring.       But it will be seen presently, from the
situation and size of the satellites, that we could hardly expect
to discover them till a telescope of the dimensions and
aperture of my 40-feet reflector should be constructed ; and
I need not observe how much we, members of this society,
must feel ourselves obliged to our royal patron, for his en
couragement of the sciences, when we perceive that the

discovery-     of  these   satellites is entirely owing to the liberal
support whereby our most benevolent King has enabled his
humble astronomer to complete the arduous undertaking of
constructing this instrument."
    To conclude : — On a review of all          Dr. Herschel's observa
tions    already made with this telescope, it appears, beyond
contradiction, that he has fully succeeded in giving it the
properties and superiority originally aimed at in its con
struction, how much soever Lalande has been led to dis
parage     it.
    Indeed, his two discoveries         of Saturn's sixth     and seventh
satellites would       of themselves    be sufficient    to render this te
lescope ever memorable, and surely ought to have prevented
it from having        been so much misrepresented.

    Zinc    is one   of the metals     that has been hitherto thought
unfit for any       of the purposes     to which the malleable metals
 are commonly applied.            It is said to possess too much brit-
tleness     and want of ductility.          Messrs. Hobson and Syl
 vester,   of  Sheffield,   assert,  " that  at a temperature between
 210° and 300° of Fahrenheit it is really a malleable metal,
that it yields to the hammer, and may be wire-drawn if kept
 at thfs temperature       during the operation     ;  they say likewise,
that after having been          thus annealed    and wrought,      it con
tinues soft, flexible, and extensible, and does not return to
                                                                        it*

 many uses for which it has been hitherto thought unfit."
 These observations being now generally circulated, the ma
 nufacturers     have  used it ; and with       so much success,     that
 .what   was   before almost useless        in the mechanical arts, is
 now     wrought    and   sold in plates similar to copper.        About
 two years since, I      took an opportunity of trying whether or
 not it could be adopted       for the purpose of covering build
 ings; for I    conjectured, if it could, that it would be a most
 valuable acquisition to the public, particularly at the present
 time, when lead and copper are so exorbitantly dear as in
  Borne measure to supersede their use.           I laid it on a tempo
  rary buildine (for experiment only) in bays, like the mode
^pursued with lead, and in a situation exposed to the mo&t
  trying heat and inclemency of this climate, and no change
  is yet visible, except in colour, which is rather darker ; nor
  does it appear    at all oxidated ; nor is there that appearance
  of  unevenness    in the surface,    as is the case with thin lead
  and copper covering      : its partial brittleness, however, makes
  it necessary to put it on in a different manner to what lead
  is, and in the shape of the roll only^ which, instead of a
   plain round, should resemble that of an inverted ci ma-recta,
   which, by forming the internal angle into an easy hollow,
   will obviate the danger of cracking on hammering it down,
   which would almost invariably follow by adopting the other
   mode.     I have been thus particular in describing this pre
   caution, knowing the consequence of an error arising from
   the other plan.     Zinc will be found extremely useful and
   ojconomical for all kinds of pipes, gutters, ^&c. ; and there
   can be no doubt of its being well adapted for the sheathing
   of ships, and, indeed, for almost         all the purposes to which
   lead  and   copper   are  applied.     Its   hardness, according to
   Thomson, is 6£°, when lead is only 5-t0 ; it melts at a tern-.          .
   perature of 7QQ° of Fahrenheit, while lead is fluid at 540°.
   It is well known in the arts, and has been the subject of
   much curious analysis by the chemists.              It was called zinc
   by Paracelsus, who, there is reason to believe, was the first
    who succeeded in obtaining it^ure;- it has also been called
                                                              ^

   spelter; but the former name is retained among the learned :
  it was known to the Romans, who used it chiefly as an al
  loy, in which way it has been always found to possess very
   singular properties.
      The expense of it    as a  covering is comparatively small, as,
  in the experiment above alluded to, after every care had been
  taken to lay it properly, the whole charge (including the altera
  tion of the rolls) did not exceed one shilling and threepence per
  superficial foot, and it may be presumed that this was dearer
  than it would be when practice has given facility to the exe
  cution.    From this it appears that it is almost as cheap as
  any covering, which promises durability, and not more than
  one-third the price of lead.        The architect may also avail
  himself of its lightness to ceconomize in the construction
  of his works.

 PSIB,ERMIT   me, through       your excellent publication, to ac
  knowledge my obligations to Mr. Donovan for the advan
 tages I have derived in my inquiries respecting the mineral

 examination of the inestimable fossils contained in his match
 less museum.
     By the investigations which I had previously made, and
from specimens in my own collection, I had ascertained
that England alone yielded several species of enormities, as
I trust I shall show in the second volume of " Organic
Remains     of the former World," now in the press. But by
an examination of the series of fossils in this department of
the London Museum, as above mentioned, I have gained
the knowledge that our own country can boast of yielding
at least one additional curious species      of this animal hitherto,
I   believe, unknown, and_fo«ning.by          the length of the arms

the brief catalogue which is delivered at the museum.
    From another specimen in the                same collection,      marked
No. 950, I        also   acknowledge having          derived      very consi
derable      information respecting the structure of that won
derful lost animal the tortoise encrinus.
    Having no       reason for concealing any       of the motives      which
induce me to trouble you with              this request,     I   do not hesi
tate to avow that one        of  these is a wish to call       the   attention
of    the   curious,    as  well   as scientific,  to the most complete
collection of British natural history which has ever yet been
formed; a museum, not confined to any one particular
branch,       but comprehending         alike the three       great    depart
ments of nature, zoological, botanical, and mineral produc
tions of the island, upon the grandest scale imaginable.                     It
will    not   be too  much    to  say that  this  museum,       from  the sci

to those desirous of such knowledge, prove a most instruc

to all those who think the natural history of their own coun

 J.  he Romans        were as little skilled    in the founding of me
tals as in all the other imitative arts.            The Etruscans, who
founded their        statues   under   the    kings, were employed in
                                                                           the

 the same business under the republic.                   Thus Spurius Ca-
 millus,   the conqueror of the Samnites,               caused an Etruscan
 artist to cast  a colossal statue of Apollo in bronze.                 It was
 the same statue which          was afterwards placed in the library
 of Augustus.       These haughty Romans, always at war with
 their neighbours and accustomed to conquer, thought it un
 worthy of their character to meddle with the arts ; it was
 even forbidden the citizens to trade or to exercise a               calling*.
All    the manual arts      were     therefore abandoned        to foreigners
 and slaves.
 •  This military spirit entirely predominated until after the
second Punic war ; having then become acquainted with the
Greeks, they began to display some taste for the arts; at least,
if we may judge of their taste from their despoiling the con
quered nations of their ornaments, and decorating their own
capital with them. In the public place of Tarentum there was
a colossal statue of Jupiter made by Lysippus,and the second
in magnitude after that of Rhodes. When Fabius Maximus
Verrucosus retook this city from the Carthaginians,he wished
to carry off this Colossus, but the difficulties attending the
carriage prevented him          f  ; he therefore contented himself
with    a Hercules,    which      was    placed    in the Capitol.       Sixty
years afterwards Marcellus took the city of Syracuse, and
sent to Rome the masterpieces of art which decorated it.
We find, from a discourse put into the mouth of Cato by
Livy, how     great an impression was made upon the Romans
by these    prodigies of the Grecian artists.
                                                             "I   see but too
many,"     he says,
                      "   who exhaust the language of rapturous
eulogy upon the masterpieces of Corinth and Athens, which
our victories have procured us, while they regard with a
disdainful smile the clay figures of the Roman gods placed
at the entrances      into    our temples      J."      Lucius Scipio and
Flaminius, the conquerors of Antioch and of Philippa; Paulus
Emilius of Persia; Mummius of Corinth, and of several
other cities of Achaia and of Boetia ; and lastly Scipio, the
destroyer of Carthage, filled Rome with a prodigious quaa*

tity of objects of the Grecian arts. The legacy which king
Attalus, when dying, bequeathed to the Roman people, put
them in possession of all Asia, and finished the entire cor
ruption of their manners.    Nevertheless, in spite of the in
troduction of luxury, the haughtiness of the Romans and
their repugnance to labour were the same.   They had seen
xnonarchs chained to the triumphant chariots of the Roman
generals; and        if they formerly considered themselves a na
tion of heroes,       they now imagined themselves superior to
kings.   The Greeks were their sculptors, their modellers,
and their founders. The small number of Roman names
found    upon the antient works is sufficient to convince us
of this *.
   Under Augustus,           while all the other arts flourished,                 thai
of   the founders began          to decline.          He    ordered        four bronze
elephants to be made, in order to decorate the via sacra.
These elephants were not melted, but wrought with the
hammer.     We. find a proof of this in Cassiodorus f. This
minister of Theodatus, king of the Goths, 500 years after
the reign of Augustus, wrote in the following manner to
the praefect    of    the city   of Rome        :   — " The      bronze elephant*
are in a ruinous state ; it would be a pity                      if these animals
should exist a shorter time in bronze than               they are said to
do in a natural state. In               order to restore this longevity to
them, we must close the openings, and join the seams by
means of iron cramps.    We must also shore up their bellies
outside, in order to preserve these works from ruin ; the
effect of which would be the more disagreeable, as their ap
pearance                                   entire."
             was so imposing while they were
   Melted or cast elephants would not have been in such a
state of decay in 500 years.  Although this fact does not
prove that the Romans at that aera were incapable of found
ing these elephants        if they wished           it,   yet   it   is   supported    by

 the testimony of Pliny *, who says that the art                                   of founding
 large statues at one cast was lost in his time.
   Among the artists celebrated in the days of Nero, Zeno-
 dorus, a Greek by birth, merits particular attention. He
 made a colossus of Mercury, in the city of the Auvergnates,
 which             in size all the colossi then known. This
             surpassed
 work cost ten years labour, and about four millions of French
 money.     After having proved his abilities by this memora
 ble essay, he was called to Rome by Nero, where he made
 a colossal figure of that emperor 110 feet high, which was
 placed in the vestibule of his golden palace.  Pliny says that
 people were wont to admire, in the workshop of Zenodorus,
 not only the model in clay regularly resembling the human
 body, but also the very small detached pieces destined to be
 put together, all of which, though in this unfinished state,
 gave a rough idea            of   the   size and character of the perform
 ance f-       We may presume, from                these expressions                 of Pliny,
that the above was not a statue cast at once, but composed
of several pieces of hammered metal. Nero would no doubt
 have preferred having his image cast in bronze at one single
jet, however great the expense a similar work might re
 quire; but the art of founding was lost. In the days of
Pliny, who nourished under Vespasian, the Roman                                        artists
were still very far from  having attained any thing like the
perfection visible in the antient bronze works.
  Soon after the time of Pliny, however, Domitian procured
his statue to be founded by a Greek artist of the name of
Celon, who, from the magnitude of his enterprise at least,
deserves to be placed among those rare men of genius who
knew how to revive an art which was thought to have been
lost.  Martial celebrated this statue in his epigrams, and
Statius % consecrated a whole eclogue to him.     We learn
from this last poem that it was an equestrian statue                                  melted,

  rested upon the figure    of  the Rhine,, represented. as a captive
  lying on the ground,       and    upon the figure of one of the
  Dacii in a similar dress    and attitude : in short, this colossus
  exceeded    in height the temples of the public square it oc
  cupied. The scaffolding and the machinery for transporting
  and raising this enormous mass were a spectacle, according
  to the same poet, as novel as it was curious, and all the
  young men in Rome were employed in raising it.                Upon
  the death of the tyrant, indignation and hatred gave way to
  every other consideration, and this wonderful colossus was
  destroyed    by order of the senate.
      Under   the emperors, all employments which did not lead
  to a speedy fortune were disregarded. " Labour, study the
  laws, exercise yourself in pleading causes," says a father to
   his son, in Juvenal*, " nothing else leads to preferment; or
   if you  would rather choose to scale and demolish the castles
   of  the Arabs, ask the emperor for a centurion's       truncheon,
   you will  perhaps obtain the command of a legion as the re
   ward of your services, but this will be when you are sixty years
   old. If you prefer trade, become a skin-dealer, and let not the
   bad smell   of the hides deter you ; the gold you earn   will place
   the perfumes of Arabia within your reach.             Every where
   around you people will ask if you have got money, but none
   will inquire how you came by it." Such was the manner in
   which riches were spoken of. The poor, who      had not the means
   of aspiring to fortune, nor the courage to attain it by dint of
   labour, attached themselves to an opulent man.          They went
   every morning and paid their reverence to their patron, in
   order to obtain food from him for the rest of the day.         The
   lower orders lived, for the most part, upon the distributions
   of corn  made by the emperors, and by the liberalities       of the
   ambitious,    who, by this means, bought the suffrages of the
   common people. Let us add to this the number and the
   duration of their public festivals, the time which was wasted
.  \a the elections  of their magistrates, and we may easily con
   ceive  that three.fourths of the people lived in absolute idle-

  luxuries     of life too much at their command to be i

      If  the monuments in marble have sometimes escaped the
 fury of     the barbarians, those in bronze have seldom outlived
 their cupidity.          The two remarkable monuments which re
 main to .us from the Romans, are the equestrian figure of
 Marcus Aurelius and the statue of Septimus Severus, which
 We see in the palace Barberini.                  M. Falconnetf,     an excellent
 statuary, has repaired the defects of the former, which is
 founded in pieces J. The statue of Severus is a fine piece
 of workmanship, and infinitely superior to the bas-reliefs
 we    see   upon the arch af Severus §.                  Whence does this dif
 ference arise ? We know that this emperor was very parsi
 monious, in order that he might fill his treasury, and leave
 to his children the means of sustaining the commanding at
 titude he had given to the empire : it seems, therefore, that
 the sculptors of his arch were checked by this ceconomy.
      Nevertheless there were instances in which he displayed
 as much         liberality as magnificence, particularly when be
 thought his glory interested.                   On one occasion he was anx
ious to see represented the subject of one of his dreams, to
which       he gave     implicit faith.           He    had dreamt that he saw
Pertinax adorned with all the attributes of the imperial dig
nity, and mounted upon a magnificently caparisoned horse,
passing along the via sacra.                     When the horse came neat
where Severus stood, he threw his rider and halted before
Severus, who mounted,                  and the animal carried him to            the
public square, amidst the acclamations of the people assem
bled.       The subject of this drcain was to be represented in
the via sacra by a group of bronze figures worthy of ap-

inown if the colossal statue in the Barberini palace has anjr
reference to this groupe; but it is certain that the beauty of
the one must have had some influence upon that of the other^
since contemporary works               always resemble each other in
their manner of execution;
   Twertty-four years after the reign of Severus, the tyrant
Maximian caused to be melted and converted into money a
great part of the statues of the gods and heroes which deco
rated the city and its temples,            without respecting either th«4
antiquity or the beauty of the performance.                      The common
people,  who    had    willingly forgiven           all  the   depredations he
committed upon the property of the rich, were thus attacked
in the most sensible point. When these fine monuments
were destroyed, their grief was so great that several, guided
by a blind zeal, were bold enough to resist, and preferred
perishing before the statues of their gods rather than witness
their destruction    t.

minution is still scarcely perceptible. Authors content them

                         To   Mr. Tillock.
TSIR,
    HE ninth   number of the Retrospect contains some further
observations on my paper in the xxivth volume of the Phi
losophical Magazine, p. 240, which might have been passed
over without any reply, had not the writer used my silence
as an argument to persuade his readers th.it 1 had drawn my
facts from Berkeley's Theory of Vision.
   Tins writer tells us, p. 236, that " Mr. Walker attempts,
as he says, to demonstrate a certain property of the eye in
two ways. In the first he makes a parade              of algebraical
substitutions, although there is no bringing         of terms to an
equation, no transposition, no extrication of known from
unknown terms ; yet, after all, he docs not demonstrate the
property of the plano-convex lens, but merely says in a note
that it is well known to mathematicians.
• " The second demonstration            is vague and loose in the
extreme;    and  where  he  reasons    from  the assumed case of a
plano-convex lens to that of the lens of the eye, n ne of
which are plano-convex, he evidently shifts his hypothesis
before the conclusion is drawn.
   " We have already said that       Mr. Walker's     pretended  ex
planation is only an elucidation of that heretofore given by
Berkeley, and we cited a passage from section 68 of that
author's New Theory of Vision. Now, although Mr. Wal
ker carefully avoids any allusion to what Dr. Berkeley ha»
done, we desire our readers would compare Mr. Walker's
additional facts in his last letter with the 70th and 71st sec
tions of Berkeley, and they will at once perceive         the sourw
whence these facts were drawn."
   lu  answer to these observations        I beg leave to say, first,
                                                                that

                  Letter from Ezekiel Walker, Esq.                . 35i
  that the author ought to have known, before he began to
  write  on optics, that the demonstration of the theorem,
 which is the foundation of my Theory of Vision, is to be
  seen in almost every book of optics that has been written in
 the English language since the days of Newton; and that              I
 nave not made a greater " parade of algebraical substitu
 tions" thanxthose writers have done. He ought also to have
 known,     that it is the common       practice of mathematicians to
 use a well known       theorem without its demonstration.
     Secondly,     if what is called   a  demonstration contains any
 one step that     " is vague and loose,"       it is no demonstration
 at all.   Had this reviewer of philosophical papers found any
 step  in my demonstration that is not strictly and rigidly true,
 he ought      to have pointed it out, and advanced some better
 arguments against it than his own bare word.
     Thirdly, " The aberration in any lens by the different re-
 frangibility will be nearly the same as in          a plano-convex  of
 the same focus.
     " For   in a double convex lens of equal radii, the refraction
 at each     surface will be but half so much as at the convex
 surface of the plano-convex,          which     has double the curva
 ture*."
     Whence it      is evident that  I  did not shift   my hypothesis
before   I drew    the conclusion.
     Lastly, As I never saw Berkeley's New Theory of Vision,
I   could not draw any facts from it ; my theory is founded
on the discoveries of a greater philosopher than even bishop
Berkeley.

and continued, though he had an evacuation           stool on             by
Saturday   ihe pain was much increased on Sunday, at
                 ;
tended with hiccup, sickness, and vomiting the symptom*           ;
being more urgent on Monday, he was visited           physi               by   a
cian, who ordered purging mixture, with tincture of opium,
                             a

pain at the navel and region of the stomach extremely di
stressing ; the hernia was small, scarcely projecting beyond
the external abdominal ring, and appeared to recede on pres
    sure completely            within   the ring.
     I
       An infusion of nicotiana               (31. to a pint of water) was in
jected and retained without                   producing the least apparent ef
fect; two grains of calomel and one grain of opium were
given in form of pill every hour, but these were rejected as
soon as swallowed.
      At six o'clock in             the afternoon the tobacco injection was
repeated and retained, but apparently                         produced no effect f
the operation being proposed, was                           acceded  to, and per
formed at 10 o'clock at night.
      The tendinous            fibres   of   the external oblique          muscle were
separated longitudinally from the. external abdominal ring
towards the superior part of the ilium, when the hernial sac
appeared of a dark blue colour and very tense, and contained
some serous fluid,                 and one fold of the intestinum                ilium,
which was of                   colour, nearly approaching to gan
                       a very dark
grene    :   the stricture on the intestine being at the internal
ring,    rendered         it of more difficult access,             but it was dilated
obliquely upwards and outwards ; that     in the direction ofis,                       a
line drawn from the symphysis pubes to the superior part of
the ilium   at that part there were strong adhesions between

violence.

 calomel were given, but immediately rejected by the sto
 mach.
    At   12  o'clock    the enema was repeated     and  retained, but
 produced no effect.         At 10 o'clock at night the countenanae
 was good, pulse 8.*, but there had not been any evacuation
by stool ; the hiccup, sickness, and vomiting continued ; an
 embrocation of soap liniment -and aether was applied to the
umbilical region, and a table-spoonful of the following
mixture was ordered to be given frequently during the night :
ft.aeth. vit. gii. tinct. opii gi. aq. menth. $\v. m.
    On the 6th,       at eight o'clock in the morning, the pulse
was 84,      a  soft skin, rather inclining to perspiration ; the
hiccup and sickness had nearly subsided, he had two copious
evacuations by stool during the night, and had also slept for
 several   hours.
    At  three o'clock     in the afternoon the vomiting of feculent
matter had returned, as violent as it had ever been before
 the operation ; pulse 96, small and thready, the countenance
more irritable, but there did not appear to be any tension of
 the abdominal viscera.
    At eight o'clock in the evening the symptoms were the
same, the medicine and embrocation were continued.
    On    the 7th    there was    no mitigation  of symptoms ; the
treatment was the same.
    On   the 8th,     the  sickness and vomiting were somewhat
abated,     some    sleep had been obtained, but no evacuation
by stool 5     the following pills were taken during the day :
Jfc. calom. gr. viii. jalapi gr. xvi. m. f. pil. iv.
    On the 9th, in the morning, the pulse was small and
thready, the sickness was much abated, but the night had
been restless, and no evacuation by stool had been obtained ;
the pills, ordered yesterday, were repeated : in the evening,
copious evacuations by stool took place, at first hard, and
afterwards fluid, and attended with griping pain; an opiate
pill was given at bed-time.
    On the 10th, the hiccup and sickness          had  subsided, the
appetite began to return; the wound was          dressed, which   had

 nearly healed ; from this time the cure went on gradually,
 and was completed in about a week.
     In this hernia,      the external swelling was but small, the sac
 being situated between           the two abdominal rings ; it receded
 easily under the edge of the transversalis muscle by external
 pressure, a circumstance not sufficiently explained in surgical
 authors , nor known by surgeons in general.                     A fatal mis
take      of this kind came within my knowledge but a short
 time since, in a patient who would willingly have submitted
to the operation, but a surgeon persisted in his capability
of reducing the hernia, because he found it to recede by ex
ternal pressure       :  the  patient died in a few daye         :  dissection
 proved the fallacy        of his judgment.

  W HEN        all the parts of the body of the tooth are made and
consolidated, and when it comes to emerge from its alveolus,
it undergoes changes of            a new description.
    As the elephant is herbivorous, its teeth are woni down
by mastication, like those of all the animals who live upon
 similar food.         We even know, lhat it is necessary that their
 teeth,   should be worn before their surfaces               are in  a fit state

 for chewing       vegetable   substances.    This   general   fart," (till
 more clearly brought to light by the labours of M. Tenon,
 proved to him or' itself, and independently of all those which
 we are about to develop, that iceth are not organised in the
 same manner with bones.            We all know to what accidents
 these    hut are exposed, when they          are cut or merely laid
 bare.
     The summits of       the small notches    of the  laminae    will be
 first worn    :—^w  hen once worn down to the            interior sub-
 Stance,     each  of these summits will present a circular or oval
 disk of    that substance, surrounded by a circle       of enamel and
 a circle    of cortical ;  and there  will be a range   of these small
  Circles by each lamina.
     If the detrition penetrates      to the bottom     of the hollows
 which produce        the notches,    all these   small circles will be
 united into one single stripe of osseous substance, surrounded
 by a double line of enamel, and the cortical substance will
 jiiake the whole tour of the tablet of the tooth, and will
 occupy all the intervals of the stripes.          Each stripe will be
the section of one of the transversal laminee which compose
 the tooth.
     And if the detrition could go the length of the place where
 the laminae all join into a single corona, the entire tooth will
 no longer present any thing else than a very large disk of
 osseous     substance, surrounded on every side by a small edge
 pf enamel and another of cortica.1.
     But the detrition can never go so far, because it never
 takes effect at the same time upon the whole corona, as the
 consolidation has not taken place there, and for the follow
 ing reason:
    The tooth, in consequence of its rhomboidal              form,    and
from     its  very   oblique position, presents its anterior part
:much sooner in mastication than it does its posterior part.
The plane or tablet produced by mastication therefore forms,
with the common surface of the summits of all the laminae,
an angle open behind ; and from this it happens, that, when
the front laminae are cut deeply, and form entire stripes, the
intermediate laminae do not as yet present any thing else
than transverse rows of circles or ovals, and those behind
                                                                      are

are completely untouched,                      and present the summits          of their
notches in the shape of nipples.
  The anterior laminae are also completely destroyed hefore
the posterior ones are strongly cut in front ; and from this
there follows                         also peculiar to ele
                        another phaenomenon,
phants ; their teeth diminish in length at the same time
that they diminish in height.
   While the exterior part of the tooth is wearing down and
diminishing, the portion of the root which corresponds to it
is worn in another manner, which is more difficult to con
ceive. On examining what remains of          we find   as      it,              it      it
were pared down     presents at its surface small irregular
                           ;   it

it   drop    by   drop.     It   is   a   kind of caries similar to that under
gone        by   the human         teeth when stripped               of their enamel.
We shall investigate the  cause of this presently.     always                 It
happens  that  the  tooth       this      is
                                       means    by
                                              successively de
prived, in the various portions of its length, of segments or
trenches which occupy the whole height of it.
   Thence also results another singular effect: the anterior,
part of the jaw being always to be filled up, the tooth moves
from behind to the front horizontally, while      moves verti          it
cally from top to bottom,  or  vice versa, according as   be*                      it
longs  to the upper or lower jaw.
     This    is   the reason why every tooth,               at the time      of its fall
ing,    is   very small, however large                 it   may have been pre
viously.
   This movement of the tooth makes room for that which
is formed in the back jaw, and which must succeed it; this
ceeond tooth assists     its development in pushing the first
                                 by
forward    and we may say that the large teeth of the elephant
            ;
come   behind  its young teeth, in place of coming above or
under, as in other animals.
   Patrick Blair*, who had seen separate transverse laminse
in the back jaws of the elephant, and who had named them
very justly rudiments    teeth, was unwilling to believe that
                                    of
these       laminae       afterwards proceeded           to form       a    tooth which

would replace the one behind which he found these laminae.
He   was therefore reduced to the necessity of searching for
various imaginary uses of them.
   Disputes were maintained as to the number of the teeth of
the elephant : the Royal Society of London perceived, in 1715,
that it varies from one to two on each side, and that the
place of the division varies also; that is, the first tooth is
longer or shorter, in proportion to the second, according to
the individuals*.    Pallas was the first who taught the mode
of their succession, which explains all                 these irregularities,    by
showing that at first they have only a single tooth on each
side ; that the second, in developing itself, pushes the for
mer in such a manner that during a certain time there are
two of them        ; afterwards      the   fall    of    the    first leaves    one
onlyf-
  I have announced   that this succession, and consequently
this alternate change in number, was repeated more than
once, because I had also found separate germs in an ele
phant which had already two teeth in their places J. Thii
last point had been already established, but with respect to
the upper jaws only, by Daubenton § ; in short, this great
naturalist had also presented to a certain degree the neces
sity of this succession from back to front, which Pallas hat
more clearly developed.
   Mr. Corse || has informed us that this succession is re
peated so often as eight times in the Indian elephant ; that
there are consequently thirty-two teeth which successively
occupy the different parts of its jaws.
   The first appear eight or ten days after birth ; they are well
formed in six weeks, and completely cut in three months.
The    second   are well cut at two years          of    age.    The third     ap
pear at this period,        and make the second fall out at six
years ; these are,   in their turns, pushed out by the fourth at
nine years.      The subsequent periods are not so well known.
   For my part, I never found more or less than three teeth
at once in the two elephants I dissected, and in five dry sket

leton heads which       I examined, viz. a small grinder more or
less ready to fall ; a    tooth in its place, and full grown ; and
a germ more        or less large, more or less consolidated, and
occupying the whole bottom of the back jaw.
    We may easily judge, from the depth of the detrition,
whether a tooth which has been found isolated, was situated
before or behind in the       jaw;    those which    were   situated   in.
 front never have any of their laminae entire.
    The number of the laminae which compose             each tooth go
on augmenting in such a manner, that each tooth has more
 laminae than that which immediately preceded it.
     Mr.  Corse, who first made this remark, gives these num
                                        * : the first have four lami
 bers from his own observations
 nae only ; the second, eight or nine ; the third, twelve or
 thirteen   ;  and so on to the seventh        or eighth, which have
  22 or 23 laminae.       Mr. Corse never saw any         teeth which
  had more.
     We   have reason to believe that these numbers are not very
  constant; for we have a lower jaw, the first tooth of which
  has  14 laminae,   and the subsequent        one has fourteen germs
 of laminae.      M. Camper has one completely similar (De-
  scrip.  Anat.   d'un Eleph. Plate XIX. fig. 2.) ; but in the
  upper jaw, which corresponds to ours, there are in the full
  grown tooth thirteen laminae, and in the germ of the subse
  quent one there are eighteen.
     Independently of the number, there are deficiences with
  respect to the thickness of the laminae; they are thinner in
  the first teeth than in the last : and as the jaws are shorter
  when they bear the first teeth, it happens that the number
  of the laminae in activity is nearly the same at all times ; i. e.
  from   10 to 12.
     When the elephant is foil grown the space occupied by
  the laminae in activity, is larger, it is true ; blit these laminas
  are themselves larger, and always fill the space whatever it
  may be.
     As it requires nearly the same time to wear down the same
  number of laminae, the last teeth, which have much more

  of them, last much longer than             the first.   The substitutions
  therefore take      place   at intervals      longer and longer     as the
  elephant advances in age.
     The   teeth    of elephants, like          those   of all other anit
  male, only push out their roots when the body •> perfect;
 the roots are formed in layers like the rest of the tooth : it
 could not well he otherwise.                 But why this division in
 another     sense,   when     the   junction of      the  caps of all   the
 gelatinous eminences seems to produce nothing else than                   a
 single body     ?
     In order to answer this question, which is of a general
 interest to all kinds of teeth, we must add a circumstance
 to the description I have given of the genus : I have reserved
 this point until the present occasion, that I might not too
 much confuse the ideas of my readers.
    The base of this gelatinous body,                  whose productions,
 which I    have    called   walls,    serve as nuclei to the   laminz of
 the tooth, docs not adhere at all its points to the bottom of
 the capsule. There are, from space to space, interruptions
 of the continuity, and consequently the adherent parts of
 this base may be considered            as very   short pedicles.    When
 the   laminae     of   osseous    substance cover all the        produc
 tions   or walls,      and    all the body of the nucleus of the
 tooth,   it is continued      always upon and between the pedi
 cles : the particles of this lamina which proceed between the
 pedicles form the under part of the body of the tooth ; the
particles which envelop the pedicles, and which are conse
quently more or less tubulous, form the first commence
ments of the roots.
    These roots, and the pedicles which serve them as a nu
cleus, are afterwards lengthened, for two reasons : at first,
the progress     of  the laminae     of  osseous    substance, which, by
always shooting, force the tooth to rise and leave the alveo
lus ; afterwards, the thickening of the body of the tooth by
the formation of the successive layers, which, by filling the
interior vacuum, hardly           leaves    any more room for the      ge
latinous nucleus,        and pushes      it towards the interior of the
tubes of the roots.
    There is uo enamel nor cortical produced upon the roots,
                                                                  because

             Mernoir     vpbn   living and fossil Elephants.            3G5
because the internal lamina              of the capsule, which has alone
the power to secrete these two substances, does not extend
so far.
     I  am   of opinion that it       is partly to this absence of enamel
that the corrosion is         owing, which begins upon the roots as.
soon     as the    portion   of   the corona corresponding to them is
worn down their length.
     At this period the root has assumed              all the development
 of which it       is capable;      the pulpy nucleus is entirely repelled
 by the layers with which it has itself filled the cavity it oc
 cupied.       This force of increasing of the root ceases there-
 fore to counterbalance the increase of the osseous partitions
 of the alveolus, and the latter continually push the root out
 wards.        It begins to rot as soon as, when showing itself
 out of the gum, it is exposed to the septic action of the air,
 the heat and humidity of the mouth.
      What, in my opinion,              adds some probability to this idea
 is, that the corrosion            begins rather at the junction of the
  mot and the corona than at the point of the root.                   I have
  several proofs of this in my specimens. We may also judge
  of it from      the small tooth represented        by  Mr. Corse.    (Phil.
  Trans. 1799, PI.        VI.    fig. 3.)    Perhaps also the mechanical
  compression         which   the    root  experiences from the alveolus
  contributes to its destruction, as we attribute the destruc
  tion    of the roots    of  the young teeth to the compression they
  receive by the        shrinking of their alveolus, occasioned by the
  development of the teeth which must succeed them.
       To cdnclude, one part of their molecules must be organi
  cally absorbed ; but this would not be the only phenome
   non in which a body, become foreign, is sucked up by th«
   lymphatics, and disappears. The fact is known with re
   spect    to   liquids.     A9 for solids,     I think we have examples
   of   it in some remote instances.              We may consult on this
   head the dissertation by Alexander              Maedonald.
       The    teeth    of the    two jaws of the elephant are easily di-
   »tinguished by their form.               Those of the upper jaw have
    their laminae disposed in such a manner, that all their sum
    mits are iu      a convex Surface.        The tablet produced    by their
                                                                    detrition

   866                "French   National Institute.
   detrition is also convex.     The contrary is the case, in these
  two respects, with the lower jaw.
      A still more striking character may be inferred from the
  direction   of the  laminae,   with respect to the corona on            the
  triturating part.
     Those from below are inclined backwards            ; that is to say,
  the acute angle they form with the plane of trituration is
  directed forward, at least in their radical part; for the sum
  mits rtf the anterior laminae are bent a little backward.
     Those from above, on the contrary, are inclined forward^
  or the acute angle they form with the plane of trituration is
  directed backward.
     It is always easy to distinguish the back of the tooth from
 the front : the trituration cutting much more forward than
 backward, it is the end the most deeply             worn    down of the
 corona, which is always the anterior*
     It must be remarked, however, that the inclination of               the
 laminae    upon the corona diminishes at the two jaws in pro
 portion as the detrition increases.           The posterior laminae,
•which are not so slowly worn down, are now worn a little faster,
because, their development towards the root           continuing     when
that of the anterior laminas has ceased, they are pushed out
wards with more force : whence it happens that the tablet
of detrition becomes more and more perpendicular to                      the
direction of the laminae.
     We also distinguish the teeth belonging to each side,              be
cause they are convex to their internal face, and a            little con-
eave to the external one.

fibs, the prtints of the hydnae, &c., are covered at certain
periods with a multitude of small grains, or powder; other
genera, like the lycoperdons, have their interior filled with
this powder, and squirt it out at the period of ripeness. These
grains arc regarded as the seeds, or as their capsules ; at leasts
this is the opinion of all botanists who think that mushrooms
have   seeds.    M.  de Beauvois    maintains,  on the contrary,
that this is the pollen, and says that the seeds are in the in
terior of the laminae or of the points, or rather in some other
part of the texture, and that they have hitherto escaped the
eyes of his predecessors       because they arc almost invisible.
It is therefore at the moment       of the explosion, and conse
quently   when   they  are already  developed, that he thinks the
grains of the lycoperdons, as well as those of the mosses,
are fecundated.
   Such is the system according to which M. de Beauvois
thinks himself authorised to erase the name of Cryptogamia,
or of hidden fructification, given by Linnaeus, and also pre
served by   Hedwig, to     these   different families, and to sub
stitute the name     of JEtheogamia, or plants of an unusual
or extraordinary fructification.
   He has published one part of his Prodromus of JEiheo*
gamy, a pamphlet in which be announces the distribution
he establishes    among the mosses ; he has separated in the
formation of the genera what Hedwig takes for the organs
of the male sex ; a precaution so far proper, as the func
tions of these parts are not yet beyond controversy ; and he
uses the    same caution,     although in opposition to himself,
by not giving any account of this columella,             which he
takes for the pistil.    Nevertheless, it is according to the or
 gans of the sexes that he separates in this same prodromus
the lycopodce of the common mosses ; but this is because he
thinks there remains no doubt with respect to the former,
at least in some genera.
    In  a second    part, still in manuscript, but read to the
class,  M.    de Beauvois    presents his distribution of mush
rooms and of the algce. In the former he has made some
 changes   in the distribution    of Persoon, and    he reduces the

 368                  French National Institute*
 number     of genera from    7 1 to  60, which he distributes in   sit
 orders.
    In a more recent memoir he asserts that he saw upon
 some young plants grains which appeared to him to be sU
 milar to the seeds of the parasite mushrooms, which-are ac
 customed to develop themselves in the substance of these
 plants and under their epidermis : from this he draws a con
 clusion contrary to a memoir of M. de Candolle,             of which
 we shall speak shortly, that these grains traverse           the  epi
 dermis in order to lodge themselves below it. Ha further
dwells on certain living mushrooms, which grow by layers
from top to bottom, contrary to other vegetables : this ob
servation was made long ago by Marsili and Bulliard ; but
M. de Beauvois adds to it the idea that each layer may be
considered as a particular individual, or as a new mushroom
proceeding from the grains of the anterior layer.
    Lastly,   M.   de Beauvois     has   shown   that there are consi
derable    differences between       the flowers of the taphia of
Oware, and those of the sagoutier of the Moluccas, so that
we should no longer leave them in the genus of palm-trees,
as hitherto done ; and he has communicated             the description
of two lobelifE.
    Among the       less fortunate^ candidates, only two     of them,
Messrs. de Candolle and Du Petit-Thouars, have presented
new memoirs on this occasion.
    M.  de Candolle,     although still very young, has enriched
•with  discoveries   as numerous as they were interestincj vege
table physics, botany properly so calledj and the maicria
medica.
    To the first of these sciences belong the observations he
tnade upon the action       of artificial light, which acting at first
but insensibly, proceeds at last to change completely the
habits of vegetables : his observations upon the cortical
pores; upon the production of oxygen gas by the green li
chens, which had been denied, but of which he showed the
reality ;  lastly, upon the vegetation of the misletoe, which
attracts very fast the sap of the apple-tree, while it cannot
suck up water into which it is suddenly plunged ; a fact
                                                                which

                      Prenck National Institute.                309
 which modifies the      ideas entertained upon the causes  of the
 Ascension   of the  sap.
    To descriptive botany belong his history of the oily plants,
 of the liliacece, of the astragal, the edition of his French
 Flora, which he published under the eye of our colleague
 M. de la Marck, and various memoirs on particular sub
jects; works which have enriched the catalogue of vegeta
 bles with 37 genera, and more than 300 species formerly
 unknown.
    Lastly, in the materia medica he was the first to distin
guish   the various vegetables     confounded under the name      of
 ipecacuanha, and those which are jumWled together under
 the name of Cvrsican moss ; and in a treatise upon the agree
 ment of the virtues of plants with their natural families, he
 has developed, according to new views, the rules to be fol
lowed in these sorts of inquiries ; rules, the neglect of which
 has led into serious errors those who were occupied before
 him with this subject, one of the most important          of prac
tical botany.
    To  all these labours    M.  de Candolle has added three me
 moirs,   which he presented to the class in the course of the
last half year.
    The first is on the subject of the parasite mushrooms,
which are developed under the epidermis of vegetables, and
which cause fatal diseases to several useful plants : the rust
or cAar, which destroys corn, and the caries or rot, which
poisons wheat, are probably to be ascribed to this cause. It
has been hitherto supposed that these mushrooms were in
troduced by the pores of the epidermis ; but as coloured li
quors cannot pass through these pores without great diffi
culty,   and as a simple application     does not inoculate these
diseases    upon   the plant,   M.  de Candolle  thinks that their
germs are introduced by the roots       with the nutritive juicea
of  vegetables,   and circulate in the interior    of  the vessels,
until they arrive    at the places proper for their development    $
he compares them in this respect to intestinal worms,       which
cannot subsist except in the interior of the body of other
animals : from this theory, and from the observation that
each species of parasite mushroom can only propagate itself

in plants of            the same     family,   he deduces         rules    from which
agriculture may derive great advantage                       in etopping this kind
of contagion.
  Before M.              de Candolle's       time, we were acquainted with
84 of these mushrooms                    :   his observations have increased
this number to 100.
      In
      memoir upon marine algce- he shows that these plants
           a
have not any real roots ; that in their organization there is
no trace whatever of vessels;                        that they absorb          humidity
throughout their whole surface ; that the more green they
are, the more oxygen gas they liberate   the light he an       °.n             ;
nounces that the small grains, hitherto regarded as their
seeds,         are only        the capsules     of them,       and contain
                                                                        grains
much           smaller, coated         with    a   viscous matter, which fixes

   Lastly, M.de Candolle has presented                        a   memoir, in botany
properly so called, upon the family                     of the     rubiacece, which
he divides into four orders, and to which he adds four new
genera.
      M.       de Petit-Thouars         has resided     a   long time         in   the isles
of France           and Bourbon,         and    has made       a     voyage to Mada
gascar.             He    has begun to publish          the    Flora of the latter,
which  very rich in singular plants; in particular, he has
               is
made some valuable observations upon the orchidece, plants
which must-be examined while in life, and which refuse all
cultivation.              He    is   ready to publish    a    great number          of new
species of these plants.      The ferns have also been   pecu                      a
liar object of his inquiries.   The island of Madagascar alone
supplied him with 89 new genera, the characters of which
he    about to print, and which he sent into France ten
      is
years ago.   His observations upon the germination of the
cycas led him to discover that this singular tree, which some
call   fern, and others
       a                    palm-tree, ought to constitute
                                         a                                                  a
distinct family.
  The draceena or candle wood has made him acquainted
with particular facts, extremely curious, which led him to
a   general         and    new system         upon    the development              of   trees.
We shall endeavour to give an idea of it.
 We know that the trunk of ordinary trees                                 increases     from
                    4                                                                     tlir

                       French National Institute.                   371
 the layers of wood, which are every year manifested under
 the bark, and that it is lengthened and ramified by shoots,
 which    are merely the development       of buds. Each of these
 new shoots has only a single layer       of wood, which is in com
munication with the last of those formed upon the trunk ;
 and the medullary thread, which occupies the axis of these
 shoots, comes from the marrow which            reigns in the middle
of the tree. Naturalists generally suppose that these suc
 cessive ligneous layers grow every year under the internal
 face  of the bark.
    Palm-trees,      and the other monocotyledonous      trees, grow
quite differently : the new fibres are developed in the axis
and not in the circumference of the trunk ; they traverse the
 whole length of this axis in order to expend themselves at
the summit of the tree in leaves and flowers.              This  is the
reason why the trunk          of  the palm-tree increases   so imper
ceptibly, particularly       below,   and  in  general  produces no
branches.
    M. Desfontaines, our colleague,        has shown that this me
thod of growing is common to nearly all the nTonocotyle-
donous plants, and distinguishes them in general from the
dicotyledonous.
    But, M. du Petit-Thouars having              remarked    that the
draccena       (trees really monocotyledonous)       ramified, as it
were, like the ordinary trees,       and wishing  to account for this
phenomenon, he ascertained by dissection that the axis of
a branch did not communicate with that of the tree, but that
 the fibres     of this branch, when arrived      at the place  of its
junction with       the trunk, blow out upon the latter, diverging
like radii   ;   the lower fibres descend directly ; the upper ones,
after having mounted a little, become crooked, and descend
 also. These trees therefore grow by concentrical layers,
and, in fact, they become thicker the more they ramify.
 Such are the facts, and the following is the system :
    M. du Petit-Thouars, applying these observations to all
the trees with concentrical layers, concluded that the new
layers are not produced by the bark, but the buds ; that their
fibres are descending prolongations of these buds, as the
•hoots are ascending prolongations.             He thinks     that the
                                    A  a 2                        juice

juice contained in the marrow furnishes               to  the buds their
 first nourishment,     as the cotyledons furnish it to the young
 plant :   he is forced to add that these fibres are developed from
 the buds, which give them birth, to the roots, with a rapi
 dity which he compares to that of light or electricity, be
 cause the ligneous layer is formed upon the whole              extent of
 the tree   in the  space   of  a   few days.     The necessity of ad
 mitting    so rapid a development is already, as has         been seen,
 a strong difficulty against this opinion.             There is another
 objection    which   seems   still  more   forcible : where we engraft
 one kind of tree upon another, a pear-tree, for instance,
 upon an apple-tree, each species forms its own wood in the
 parts which come from itself; the graft has apple-tree wood
 only, and every thing above the insertion is pear-tree wood
 only. We may distinctly observe the place where the two
  woods are separated ; and, as great care has been taken to
  strip the graft of its buds, it must necessarily follow, that
  its wood was furnished by the bark alone ; for bow, the
  partisans of the antient doctrine ask, can pear-tree budt
  produce apple-tree wood ? It is, answers M. du Petit-
  Thouars,    because the fibres       which   descend   from these buds
  cannot be nourished       in their passage along the trunk of the
  apple-tree, except     from   the juices furnished to them by the
  latter.

                    METEORIC       STONE IN RUSSIA.
 Wn     the 13 th  of March last, in the afternoon, the inhabitants
 of the canton of Juchnow, in the government of Smolensk,
were alarmed by an uncommon lou'd clap of thunder.                 At
the moment of this explosion two peasants belonging to the
village of Peremeschajew, in the canton of Werreja, being
out in the fields, perceived at the distance of 40 paces, a
black stone of considerable magnitude falling to the earth,
which it penetrated to a considerable depth beneath the snow.
It was dug up, and found to be of an oblong square figure,
of   a black   colour,     resembling cast iron.      Its surface was
rery smooth, shaped like a coffin on one side, and it weighed
 about Kio pounds.
                             MISCELLANEOUS.
    A  traveller who lately arrived at Baltimore, in America,
has brought from the banks of the Missouri an enormous
tooth of a mammoth.               He relates, that being occupied,
along with others,        ii  searching for mines in the neighbour
hood of the river, they found the extent of a quarter of a
mile square, filled, to the depth of six feet, with bones of an
enormous size.         The above traveller offers to produce, upon
payment of a certain sum, a complete skeleton of a mam
moth,     which is 54 feet long and 22 in height.         The middle
toe of the fore foot of this skeleton is 7 feet 8 inches long.
Each jaw has eight enormous grinders.             The tooth brought
by the traveller was presented         by him to the Baltimore   mu-
•eum.      What     he has related as to the enormous quantity      of

 bones he saw may be exaggerated, but it would be interest

     The Instructions for Vaccination, drawn up by the Vac
 cine Society of Copenhagen, have been translated into the
  Icelandic    language by      M.   Thorarsen.      It  is expected that
 by this means the ravages of the small-pox will be entirely
 stopt. The work has been printed, and the copies distri
 buted, gratis, throughout          Iceland,    accompanied     with en
 gravings.
     It  has been    mentioncJ in       some   of the foreign   journals,
 that   M. Klaproth,     the orientalist,    had set out for Pekin   with
 the Greek missionaries.           This is not the case, however;
 M.    Klaproth    having    set  out   for Kiachta with M. Helm, a
 botanist, in order to explore the frontiers of Chinese and
 Russian Tartary.          At Kiachta M. Klaproth composed a
 Chinese and Jipane_se dictionary.
     The university of Coimhra, in Portugal, has been enriched
 by a bequest of the library of Monsenhor Hasse, who lately
 died at Lisbon. The rare books and manuscripts of this
 rich library amount to nearly 12,000 volumes.                    Besides
 some    Latin   and Spanish works        of the 15th century,    it con
 tains every thing,      both in print and manuscript, upon the
 Portuguese legislation, as well as most of the scarce works
upon Portuguese and Spanish literature.
    An institution for      the cure   of  the deaf and dumb has been
established     in Sweden.       The number of        these  unfortunate

Calmar,      Ikera,   and Carlstadt,      alone contain t87.
     Basilius,   a learned    Greek   _ physician   at Constantinople,
has published a collection of letters in order to form a pure
modern Greek epistolary style. He has introduced into it
several letters of Alexander Maurocordato,              the Turkish mi
nister who had so much influence in the affairs             of the Otto
man cabinet betveen the years 1653 and 1699.                  These let
ters, which are      the   most   interesting of the collection, arc
followed by some others of Nicolas Maurocordato, the son
of the minister who was alternately prince of Wallachia and
Moldavia.        The work is also enriched with some notices
upon learned Greeks; such as James Manas d'Argos, Ge-

    M. D. Brewster, of Edinburgh, has invented a new an
gular and position micrometer, which serves also for a per
spective micrometer ; and a goniometer for measuring the
angles of crystals.    It also furnishes a method of ascertain
ing the apparent values of all angles seen in perspective, and
also their real value, when one of the lines which contains
the angle is either a vertical or horizontal line on a level with
the eye.     We believe this is the only instrument that can
measure angles without the observer being at the angular
point, and it has likewise all the properties of the common
micrometer.
