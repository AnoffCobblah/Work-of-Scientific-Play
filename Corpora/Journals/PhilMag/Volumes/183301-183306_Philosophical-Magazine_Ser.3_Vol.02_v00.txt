actly that    of the freezing point.

height of Irkoutsk above the level of the sea, it is impossible
to compare the above result with that of the formula.           I have

      Paris.                  Brussels.           Göttingen.                  Berlin.         Stockholm.

     The result for Berlin differs greatly from that which might
have been expected from the general decrease of the intensity
with the latitude. I have no reason, however, to suppose
that there is any error in the observations. The dip was de
termined by four trials, as well by myself alone, as by M. Riess
and me; and the differences between the results were ex
tremely small.

 IV. Of       the Structure            of Living      Fabrics.           By the Rev.
                         PATRICK KEITH,              F.L.S.*
THE    structure of every living fabric is composed partly of
  solids, and partly of fluids. The solids are the substances
which constitute the several parts or organs that give form to
the fabric, as the head, feet, limbs and trunk of animals; or
the root, trunk, leaves, and flowers of vegetables.      The fluids
are substances absorbed or imbibed from without, or formed,
secreted, or exhale ‘rom within,_as chyle, blood, lymph,
urine,—sap, nectar, cambium, expressed juice.           While life
remains the fluids are in motion, except in the very singular
case of the hybernation of some animals, and perhaps of some
plants; or in the equally singular case of some very vivacious
animalcula, which, though left on the stage of the micro
scope till they have shrunk, by the evaporation of the fluid in
which they were placed, to a mere dry and shrivelled-up mem
brane, will again revive and move as at first, upon the appli
cation of a little fresh water. The same thing happens to
many of the mosses, which will revive and recover their ver
dure when moistened with water, even after having been com
pletely dried, and kept in a dried state, for many years.
   The perfection of the individual is in the ratio of the com
plexity of    its
               organization. The fewer the organs, the fewer
the faculties with which the individual         endowed.  isThis                          is

incident upon              it,long      the angle

                                                                          I                            a
convex lens         5-8 inches focal      length    with       obtuse-angled          an
prism placed upon                  its
                             plane side, the obtuse angle being over
the centre      of
                 the lens.         drop   A   water was placed between
                                                            of
them.     Though             its
                          refractive index differs sensibly from that
of  the  glass,  yet   the reflexion                     at

prism and lens          almost totally destroyed, for the following
                         is
reason. The surface                 of
                              the lens        suppose very slightly con

vex, and when the drop               water     ofinterposed, and the air
                                                                  is

           between      two Substances       of different refractive Powers.                25
 bubbles are rubbed out, Newton's rings are seen, very large
 though slightly irregular, with the black spot in the centre.
 The rings in question are seen through this black spot, and
 consequently are not injured by the effects of reflexion. The
 water seems to have the power of bringing the lens and prism
 into closer contact than is otherwise attainable * : for am                           I
 well convinced that no force that could be applied without                                in
juring them would bring them so near together as to exhibit
 the central black.
    For the denser medium                   I
                               have used a diamond with a sur
 face of about tº inch in diameter,   mounted in a ring: for the
 use of which I am indebted to the politeness of William John
 Broderip, Esq. Vice-President of the Geological Society.
 When the lens and prism were placed on this, a small system
 of rings was seen perfectly distinct and well formed, the dia
 meter of the fifth ring not exceeding # of the diameter of the
surface.
   These rings were examined with the combination of tour
maline and doubly-refracting prism that I have described.
When the angle of incidence was small, the rings formed by
light polarized perpendicular to the plane of reflexion were
seen sufficiently vivid, with black centre, accompanied by the
other set of rings which were faint. When the angle of inci
dence reached the polarizing angle of the glass, the first set of
rings disappeared. On increasing the angle, the first set of
rings was again seen with centre white. In the most favour
able state, the first set of rings was much more faint than the
second, but not so faint that there could be the slightest doubt
upon the fact of the existence of the rings and the whiteness
of the centre, as I saw them repeatedly with every change in
the arrangement of the apparatus, and saw a succession of
several rings.   The white spot appeared larger than the dark
spot in the other set of rings, but this      imagine is owing   I
merely to the undefined nature of the spots, and to the circum
stance that, in appreciating their comparative extent, the eye
always gives credit to the brightness for a greater surface than
it can properly claim. In respect of dimensions of correspond
                  I
ing parts, could see no difference. On increasing the angle
      I
   * may here mention a curious circumstance which occurred to me in
the use of this combination.    After leaving the prism, with the lens hanging
to   its
       lower surface, for one      two days, the water contracted itself
                                       or                                                  to

I  was not able     move the lens upon the prism, though

26 Prof.      Airy on the        Phaenomena          of Newton's Rings,                  as formed
of incidence, the first              set   of rings again disappeared, and                         re
appeared in great brilliancy, the centre being now black.
     Iam willing to think these experiments important, because
they bear immediately upon a part of Fresnel's theory which
has always appeared to me most liable to objection, namely,
the formulae for the extent of vibration in reflected and                                          re
fracted rays.      On the truth of Fresnel's general theory as a
mere    geometrical   representation, namely, that light consists of
transversal    vibrations,  and that polarized light is light in which
 all the vibrations are perpendicular         the plane  to polarization,      of
I  shall say nothing, because             not think

stage except a total absence    of rings. From the agreement of
 this with theory                I
                       conclude that the polarization of light at
 the inner surface of glass is (to the senses) complete.    But at
 the polarizing angle of the diamond the case is perfectly dif
ferent. On increasing the angle of incidence till it exceeds
 this angle, the white-centred rings do not disappear, but the
 first black ring contracts so as to leave no central white, and
 becomes itself the black centre.     After this there is no mate
rial change:             I
                 find, however, that the black centre of the rings
produced by light polarized perpendicular to the plane of re
flexion is always (beyond the polarizing angle of the diamond)
sensibly larger than the black centre of the rings produced by
light polarized in the plane of reflexion.               -
    The nature of this transition from   rings of one character to
rings of the opposite character appears to me to be, theoreti
cally, extremely curious. As the rings do not disappear, it is
plain that if light polarized perpendicular to the plane of inci
dence (or whose vibrations are entirely in that plane) is inci
dent at what is called the maximum polarizing angle of the
diamond, a portion of it is still reflected.    Still, however, on
increasing the angle of incidence the character of the rings is
changed: and this takes place at an angle where (so far as we
are entitled to conclude) there is nothing peculiar in the re
flexion from the glass; and we are therefore compelled to
admit, that the incident vibration being a . sin

angle of incidence; which is not the case at the polarizing

 nomena observed by me are entirely inconsistent with this
 supposition.            If
                      homogeneous light were used, then (on this
 supposition) the bright-centred rings would disappear and
 black-centred rings would succeed them as at the polarizing
 angle of the glass. If white light were used, the rings in the
 neighbourhood of the polarizing angle would be wholly co
loured, and on changing the angle the intensity of the differ
ent colours in each ring would alter, but there would be
nothing like contraction. Thus at a certain angle the bright
est part of the red would be at the centre of the spot, and                                       its
faintest part would                 be
                                the first ring; while for the blue the

other electrical phaenomena by the same mode of excitation,
(which have completely verified my anticipations as to the
real character of the excited force which operates on the

different head.       Magnetic Electricity is an appellation

generally, every class of phaenomena hitherto developed by
magnetic excitation of the electric matter, whatever may be
the character or form of the metal employed.                 It will there
fore be more consistent with          simplicity   to confer on the whole
that general appellation; and to designate, if necessary, each
individual class of phaenomena by                       its

is but half accomplished. There is still something more to
be done.       A process of ratiocination has yet to be exercised,
frequently above the sphere of the mere experimenter, which
conveys the ideas                  far
                              beyond the simple exhibition               phaeno                       of

penetrate into the more recondite recesses                  nature; transport       of
the mind        to the very source from which emanate proximate
and    unerring      fundamental laws, and display               superior radi           in
ance    of   philosophic light the modus operandi                    which the                 by
 dormant powers are impelled into activity, and exercise their
dominion over the resulting obsequious phaenomena.

poles, and one, at least, of each description,--it will next be
necessary to take into consideration in what manner the two
systems of polar matter affect each other, and in what manner
the elementary polar lines of each system become deflected
out of their natural rectilinear course by their mutual attrac
tion of each other.
    If fine steel or iron filings be gently scattered on a sheet of
card paper, under which is placed a bar magnet, they will im
mediately become polarized by the influence of the magnetic
matter enveloping the bar; and if they be slightly agitated by
hitting the paper a few gentle taps with a pencil or other such
light body, they will become arranged in multitudes of ex
ceedingly fine lines, some of which will be straight, and others
curved, as in fig. 3. Conspicuous lines, each with a dash
across one of          extremities, are drawn,

direction, in front of the metallic poles; whilst but very trifling
deflections of the polar lines are to be seen, along the edges of
the magnet: even on the outside of the limbs the aberrations
are much less than those exhibited on the surface of the bar
magnet fig. 3. at similar distances from the poles.
   In this case the magnetic polar lines maintain their natural
rectilinear direction, even at considerable distances from the
extremities of the metal, and particularly between the limbs
of the magnet; in consequence of the two systems emanating
from the metallic surface in diametrically opposite directions,
and meeting each other, as it were, in the same rectilinear path.
On the outside of the limbs, the aggregate of the two systems
of polar lines, in the plane of the magnet, are not only so far
separated from each other as to be little affected by their mu
tual attraction, but are also so situated with regard to the
transverse curvilinear forces (see fig. 5.), that they form a
series of resultant right lines in the plane of the magnet.
These lines have, however, a small degree of flexure from their
natural course, arising from their mutual attractions in the
direction of the metal, which bend them a little towards the
centre of the magnet.
   Having thus illustrated what I consider to be the virtual
polar magnetic lines, and also their most usual arrangements
in the vicinity of steel, or other ferruginous magnets, I now
propose to show that the eccitation of magnetic electricity,
and also the direction of the currents excited, are referable to
the agency and position of these polar magnetic lines alone;
 without any regard whatever to the poles, figure, or position
of the steel which they envelop; any further than as those lines
 are casually arranged on       surface,its                    by

ment of dates and circumstances connected with that diffusion
of his views, which is known to have had great effect in the
advancement of the subject in this country, before the appear
ance of his geological map in 1815; and such a statement the
writer of these pages is enabled to give upon the best authority,
through the kindness of Mr. Phillips of the York Institution,
who has entrusted to him several original maps and other
papers, of very early date, prepared chiefly by Mr. Smith
himself at various times.     The collection however, unfortu
nately, is but a part of what it was originally; several of the
documents having been lost on Mr. Smith's removal from his
residence in London in 1819.
    The best mode of introducing the information contained in
these papers, will be to prefix a brief notice of Mr. Smith's
progress, drawn up in very unpretending language by himself,
about the year 1804.

‘the great similarity in the rocks of oolite, on          and near the end

‘posed of one, two, or even three, of those rocks, as by the di
 “stinctions of some parts seemed to appear. These doubts
“were at length removed by more particular attention to the
“site of the organized fossils, which I had long collected.
 ‘This discovery of a mode of identifying the strata by the
 “ organized fossils respectively imbedded therein,          the sharp

‘most important distinctions; which at once seemed to clear
 “away the rubbish and common stumbling-blocks in geology.

‘parts of that work: but getting into a variety of business, in

equal   regularity may not be observed, with equal care; but
simply because the commercial value of the coal is great
enough to justify a large expenditure of capital in those ope
rations of surveying and levelling, which are indispensable to
the perfection of geological maps and sections. Among the
documents connected with this early period of his inquiries,
is a section of strata sunk through for coal, at Pucklechurch
in Gloucestershire, in which a considerable depth of lias and
red-marl is represented nearly in a horizontal position reposing
directly upon coal-strata, which are highly inclined. The
drawing is very well executed, and could not fail to suggest
to Mr. Smith the important fact, that these two groups of
strata are, generally, unconformable in that part of England:
—but in this we have already seen that he was distinctly an
ticipated by Mr. Strachey.
   Another document still preserved, of about this date, is a
part of a coloured section, from the chalk-downs near Salisbury,
to the coal-measures near Bristol. What remains of this draw
ing goes down to the red marl, and gives in detail, with very
little room for correction even at the present day, the out
crop of the several beds, as they appear along the main road
through Norton, Hinton, Broadfield, and Mitford. A single
transverse section of this kind on a well chosen line, it is ob
vious, is sufficient to unveil the whole structure of any strati

Farleigh near Bath, in 1799, he acquired one of his most steady
and disinterested friends. When this gentleman, who had been
himself a zealous geological inquirer, first showed his col
lection of fossils to Mr. Smith, the latter began immediately
to place them in the order of the strata, to the extreme asto
nishment of the collector, at the new light thus suddenly
thrown upon a subject which he had long and successfully
studied in other points of view.     By Mr. Richardson, Smith
was made known to Dr. Anderson, who, forcibly struck by
the novelty and importance of his discoveries, urged him
to prepare an account of them for publication in a periodical
work on Agriculture, and            its

  borious     business,   and    struggling     with difficulties, may well
  be allowed to tremble at the prospect of appearing, for the
  first time as an author, and on a subject upon which he felt
  his reputation must ultimately depend.                He says himself, in
  one of his     letters,    “Many     of the better learned in the world
   “might deem it the height of folly, for a man who has never so
  “much as received a common grammatical education to at
  * tempt to instruct the public.’             The work of composition,
  therefore, went on but slowly; and in reply to pressing letters
  from Dr. Anderson during the autumn of 1799, there is a
  draft of an answer from Smith apologizing for this delay, and
  stating that without aid and instructions he was much at a
  loss to arrange his papers in such order as would make them
  fit   for publication: “But,”                   he
                                           continues, ‘had not business

to the Rev. Joseph Townsend, of Bath; at whose house the
former wrote, from Smith's dictation, and at the suggestion of
 Townsend, that “Tabular View" of the order of the strata in
 the vicinity of Bath, with their respective organic remains, of
 which the original is now in the museum of the Geological
 Society. A copy of this very remarkable document is inserted
 in the present paper (see the TABLE in p. 46 and 47); and it is
 unquestionably one of the most striking examples of elaborate
and successful research which the history of geology affords.
 It will be perceived, as Mr. Sedgwick observes", that the suc
cessive groups from the chalk to the coal-measures inclusive,
are here denoted by series of numbers; the author not having
then decided upon those names for them which he subse
quently adopted, and which still form a part of the geological
 nomenclature of England.
    From such interviews, and from excursions with Smith
 himself in the neighbourhood of Bath, Mr. Townsend became
fully possessed both of his principles, and of the detail of his
results: and the knowledge thus acquired he published sub
sequently (in 1813) in a volume, already mentioned;—which,

 “system with great pleasure.
     “In  January 1802, at the Duke of Bedford's request, Mr.
 * Smith came to Woburn, to investigate the stratification of
 ‘the southern parts of this country, and the parts of Bucking
 “hamshire adjoining. The letter announcing the arrival of
 “Mr. Smith, is dated 23rd January 1802, inviting me to join
 ‘them on the following Monday, to spend three or four days
‘on a geological survey, to commence near Dunstable, at the
‘foot of the chalk hills, and thence to Wendover, Aylesbury,
 * Quainton,   Winslow, Leighton, &c. In this survey we loaded
“ourselves with fossils and specimens;–and thus commenced
“our geological experience under the guidance of the - founder
 * of the system.
    “More investigations of this nature would have followed,
“but for the death of the Duke of Bedford, under whose kind
‘patronage, and at whose expense, the first survey was
 * made.”
    The picture given in the beginning of these passages is
very striking.    Those who are acquainted with the imperfect
diffusion of  geological  knowledge in England even at the pre
sent day, can imagine what it must have been to deliver a
lecture on a new geological system, after dinner, to an assem
bly of English farmers at an agricultural meeting, more than
thirty years ago; nor can they be surprised at the result de
scribed by Mr. Bevan.       Yet even there this zealous devotion
and enthusiasm were not without reward: for Smith then made
one convert of such value as to compensate for the inattention
of many of his reluctant hearers.
    Mr. Farey was another pupil who became known to Mr.
Smith about the same time: and in a letter to Sir Joseph
Banks, giving an account of the geological excursions men
tioned by Mr. Bevan, Mr. Farey states, that he had then
seen in Smith's possession a coloured geological map, of very
large size, (about 74 feet by 5 feet,) on which the outcrop of
the several strata was delineated; and that Smith had given
him information of peculiar value on the distinctions between
the superficial accumulations of clay, loam, and gravel, and
the same substances in the form of regular strata.
    In May   1804, he attended a meeting of the Board of Agri
culture in  London,   for the purpose of exhibiting his maps and
sections, and of explaining his views, and was requested by the
Board to prepare a specific statement of his researches.        At
the Woburn     sheep-shearing  of the same year, a paper was drawn
up by Sir Joseph Banks, and a sum of money raised, by sub
scription from the Duke of Bedford and other eminent and

 patriotic persons, for the double            of publishing Smith's
.
 works, and of compensating the author, on the ground that
 ‘the expenses he had incurred in travelling and in sacrificing
 ‘time that ought to have been altogether devoted to his pro
 “fessional duties, were not likely to be repaid to him by the
 ‘profits of their publication.” In the course of this year also
 his collection of specimens was removed to his house in
 London; where it was seen and examined by many of the
 persons interested in the subject; among whom were several
 of those who afterwards became leading members of the Geo
logical Society, on the institution of that body in 1807. The
            was subsequently (1806) purchased by Government
for the British Museum, where it now remains.
    In the mean time, this continued delay in the publication of
works so long announced, must have appeared unaccount
able to those who were not acquainted with the circum
stances; and as the hopes of a communication from the author
himself had been so often disappointed, it was not to be ex
pected that other persons should abstain from applying the
general principles which had been so freely diffused.        Those
who, from indolence or a fastidious desire of perfection, or—
as in the case of Mr. Smith, from a combination of unfor
tunate events,    too long delay the appropriation of what they
have done, must be content to run the risk of seeing their
discoveries brought forward by other persons.          Nor would it
be just or reasonable, without the strongest evidence, to doubt
the fairness of such rival claimants. The history of every
science abounds in examples of coincidence in discovery, pro
duced by accident, by the natural course of inquiry,          or by
the effect of hints so  very slight, as not to be appreciable  even
by those who act upon them.
    During the latter years of Mr. Smith's progress in England,
the French naturalists had been intently occupied in the ex
amination of their own country: and in 1810, Cuvier and
Brongniart published an abstract of their celebrated work on
the environs of Paris”, which was followed during the next
year by the volume itselft.      Of a work so well known, it is

sufficient to say, that no publication has given a greater im
pulse to geological science;—bringing into view distinctly,
and for the first time, that great class of deposits which con
nects the secondary strata with the products of still subsisting
operations, establishing on impregnable ground the import
ance of zoological inquiries to the history of the earth, and
affording some of the most masterly examples of the investi
gation of local details.   The principles on which this memo
rable work is framed, are precisely those to which Smith had
previously been conducted, and which there can be no ques
tion he had made known extensively in England, so far back
as in 1799,-superposition      of strata, identified by the fossils
which they contain: and to these principles it is plain the
French philosophers must have been led, by the independent
inquiries which had been long going on in France, and by
the better acquaintance of the French naturalists with Wer
ner's doctrines as to the order of formations.      After mention
ing the steadiness in the order of the strata throughout the
tract which they describe, the authors have thus distinctly
announced the principle of which they availed themselves in
recognising them.—

per; so that the series of figures may serve to place before
the eye of the reader some of the most important steps which
geological science has made in this country. The first figure
of   the plate represents                   a real section,        by    Mr. Strachey, of
 a colliery in Somersetshire, in which the relative position of
 the red-marl and superior strata, and of the coal-measures, is
 distinctly seen. The second figure proves that Strachey was
 acquainted also with nearly the whole of the English series
                         ãº
 of strata, though he suffered himself to be called aside from
 the facts, by a
 inclined   position.

 Michell illustrates his masterly exposition of the structure of
 the globe. It is in truth an abstract section, on a very small
 scale, of what really exists in nature. The fourth figure is
 Smith's section of England just mentioned; and was at the
 time of       of its
                publication not only the first and most perfect
 display       the strata       this island ever published, but un

                         it would not be prudent to adopt with
                      When coal-gas is used, the change in the
 colour of the flame indicates with great precision the exact
                                                                                      59
 amount of oxygen which is sufficient to insure perfect com
 bustion; and by these means I readily effected the fusion of
 100 grains of clippings of platinum into a perfect button,
 with an expense of less than three pints of oxygen gas. The
 aperture of the jet did not become, during the process, hotter
 than the hand could bear.         The combustion of the gases is
thus rendered so extremely manageable and oeconomical, that
I  have not the least doubt that by the proper arrangement
of three or four such jets, the waste cuttings of platinum which
are formed during the working of that metal, and which at
present can only be worked up by redissolving them in acid,
might be readily melted together, and applied to profitable use.
I   have succeeded in melting together a considerable quantity
of the grains of crude platinum, after digestion in nitric acid;
but the button was perfectly brittle under the hammer.
    By placing the end of the jet b h within a lantern provided
with a parabolic reflector, and exposing to the flame upon a
pin of platinum a small fragment of lime, I succeeded perfectly
in exhibiting the beautiful experiment of Lieut. Drummond’s
light; and can produce a prismatic spectrum almost equal in
brilliancy to the solar. By concentrating the rays of light
from the same source by means of the lenses of a solar micro
scope, phosphorus may be inflamed, and chloride of silver
blackened; affording a beautiful illustration of the conversion
of heat, which will not pass through glass into heat which will
pass through glass, with       all

 night rendered these observations somewhat difficult, being
 a transition of no less than 60° Fahrenheit, from the heat
 under which I had been suffering in the plain a few days be
fore. The longitudes which I have deduced chronometrically
cannot of course be depended upon to great exactness, con
 sidering the trial to which the instrument is subjected in tra
velling on the mountains. The rates which I shall give below
will show the degree of confidence which may be placed upon

which it has been subjected: the rates              I

     Observations on the              Minuteness of Animalcula.  In a Letter

     Esq. F.G.S.
          My dear Sir,
INwhich   the course of          a series     of microscopical observations, in
            I have been of late engaged, accident has thrown in
 my way a species of natural micrometer, an account of which
I  now beg leave to send you. For though it may possibly not be
 new to one so well acquainted with every thing relating to
                                               I
 such subjects as yourself, yet think it worthy of description,
 from        its
           having brought home         my own mind the conviction
                                                   to
byof
     afact   nature, which, though we are assured
                   in                                            reality    of        its
     numerous authors who have written              animalcula, on   yet                     is
almost   beyond  the  range     credibility,
                                         of   unless proved      actual               by
demonstration.
    All authors who have treated                     of
                                          microscopic objects, have
said that there are some animalcula            inconceivably minute,
                                                           so
that      would   require   many  thousands        them         of
                                                            form the        to
         of it                 Now, although we may                             be
                         of of
size       grain
              a       sand.                                   satisfied
that the extent       created objects appears quite boundless,                                    in
whichever direction         the scale we may direct our thoughts,
                                 of
yet the powers       the human understanding are
                         of                               much more        so
limited, that though the tongue may express                          it,
                                                        the mind fails
in     its
       attempt          to
                    conceive defined ideas       organized beings
                                                            of                                    so
much below the scale          which our common conceptions are
                                      on
formed.
                                                                            by
                                                                                                  of he
I     have not found,         any author, the mode
                                   in                       which
arrived          at
            his conclusions    respecting    the comparative    size

                         and on the Minuteness                     of Animalcula.                          65
the two objects above named.              Leuwenhoek calculates, pro
bably from conjecture, that the size of some animalcula is to
that of a mite, as a bee is to that of a horse. I think that the
following observations will demonstrate the truth of that remark;
but in a manner more conclusive and convincing than mere
conjecture.
    In the course of last winter, having observed on a dry and
frozen gravel walk a variety of small hollows, of a greenish
colour, it occurred to me that that tint might have been occa
sioned by the scum upon water during the summer rains; and
if   so,
       that would probably contain animalcula.
                  it                                           accordingly            I
scraped off little   a             of
                          the frozen  surface,   and mixed with water                      it
which had been boiled, and              which      had previously ascer
                                                     in                I
tained that there were no animalcula.               In few hours ex              a                I
amined       drop
                a      this    of
                            water,  and   found,      yet,    animalcula;   as         no
but I   discovered number        a    minute transparent fibres, appa
                                                    of
rently vegetable, and                     to
                               the existence       which, the green tint
                                                                       of
I  had first remarked was      probably    owing.       found these fibres  I
transparent; and when viewed                    certain degreein   a shade,                     of
I  observed them             marked throughout their whole length,
                                 to     be
in  the most delicate and regular manner, with divisions like
globules          hollow tube, each
                 byin                                         of

                                          similar dimensions.             the                        In
                of

            I           observed,    except   perhaps   those found                                   in   an

                                                  and moved about with
considerable activity.

             had then an exactly graduated scale for this par
ticular calculation; and by taking the square and cubic mea
sure of a variety of grains, of different shapes, and striking
the mean of the whole, I found that instead of many thousands
of animalcula for the size of a grain of sand, there were from
one to three millions, necessary to make up the solid bulk.
For I found the mean of ten measurements to be, 50 of the
globules, which, with their 50 equal intervals, made 100 for
the side of a square: the matter therefore stood thus;
                100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000.
But in this calculation I had by no means taken the smallest

the   young ones are less noisy and more flagging in the motion of
their  wings.  Than the flight of the Woodcock before and after in
cubation, Sir F. Mackenzie states that he knows nothing more rapid,
as for an hour or two about dusk he (probably the male, though
two have been seen together pursuing each other) flies in large
circles over the tops of the trees, uttering his sharp and piercing
cry, a whistle which sportsmen may have occasionally heard weakly
when cocks are first flushed in the back flight in March. Some
times his sudden flight will be arrested and changed into a sailing
slowly, like a pouter Pigeon, his cry being at the same time varied
to a purr or bleat resembling that of the Ptarmigan ; then he will
dart away with greater rapidity than a Pigeon in full flight, moving
his wings, however, with a different action from that of the Pigeon,
and with inconceivable rapidity.
   The soil where the nests were found is gravelly and rather dry;
the grass tolerably long, without underwood; and the trees, oak,
birch, and larch not exceeding thirty years' growth. The situation
is warm, and not 150 feet above the level of the sea; it is not far
distant from the river. The woods are kept quiet, and several phea
sants' nests were hatched in their close vicinity.
   It is probable that the parent birds sought this spot for the pur
pose of breeding, as they must have arrived in the spring from
other localities: for those who shot in the covers till February de
clare that they did not know of a single Woodcock being then left
in them; and had there been two or three, the keeper must have
been aware of it.
   The skeleton was exhibited of the Weasel-headed Armadillo, Da
sypus 6-cinctus, Linn.; and Mr. Owen read some Notes on the
osteology of that species; which are given in full in the Proceedings
of the Committee. Among other particulars mentioned were the
following     :-     1st, 2nd, and 3rd dorsal vertebrae are the longest,
   The spines of the
and slope considerably backwards; the rest of the spines, together
with those of the lumbar vertebrae, also incline in the same direc
tion, but in a less degree. “Every one who has seen the living
Armadillo running about the open plot of ground in the Society's
Gardens must have been struck with the machine-like manner in
which the body is carried along. The short legs are almost con
cealed, and their motions are not accompanied by any correspond
ing inflections of the spine, the two extremities of the trunk not
being alternately raised and depressed as in the quadrupeds which
move by bounds.        Hence there is no centre of motion in the
vertebral column, or point towards which the spinous processes
converge, but           all
                     these have        direction towards the sacrum.

superadded to the manubrium.       This part is evidently a rudimentary
form of the   Y-shaped   bone placed   anterior to the manubrium of the
Ornithorhynchus, which Cuvier regards as analogous to the os furca
torium of birds; it thus affords an additional and very interesting ex
ample of the affinity of the Edentata to the Monotremata, and supplies
a step which was wanting in tracing the recedence of the latter, in
their remarkably constructed sternum, from the mammiferous to the
oviparous type of the Vertebrata.     The manubrium itself also presents
a  peculiarity observable in that of the Monotremata, viz., a mesial
longitudinal ridge on the anterior surface. This appearance in the
Ornithorhynchus is regarded by Cuvier as indicative of an original
division in the bone itself, ‘Ossemens Fossiles,’ v. pt. 1, p. 149; but
Mr. Owen has examined the foetus of the minebanded species, and find
that ossification commences in the manubrium by a single central nu
cleus, and not by two lateral depositions.       The other bones of the
sternum appear on an anterior view, to be almost deficient, being
wedge-shaped, with the apices anterior ; their number is four, ex
clusive of the ensiform cartilage.
   The caudal vertebrae, like the cervical, present in Dasypus a pe
culiarity which is also found in the Cetacea, viz. that of having infe
rior spines, or V-shaped bones. These are present beneath               but                              all

    Mr. Woods concluded his communication by remarking, that it is
difficult to conjecture for what purpose these minute claws are deve
loped in so strange a situation, that of stimulating the animals to
anger being of course out of the question. It is at least evident, he
observes, that they can fulfil no very important design in the animal
oeconomy, from their smallness, their variable form, their complete
envelopement in the fur, and especially from the readiness with which
they are detached and consequently the majority of individuals de
prived of them for the remainder of their lives.

ingeniously applied.
    An eminent London cutler, Mr. Weiss of the Strand, to whose
inventions modern surgery is under considerable obligations, has
remarked, that steel seemed to be much improved when it had become
rusty in the earth, and provided the rust was not factitiously produced
by the application of acids*. He accordingly buried some razor blades
for nearly three years, and the result fully corresponded to his expecta
tion; the blades were coated with rust, which had the appearance of
having exuded from within, but were not eroded, and the quality of the
steel was decidedly improved. Analogy led to the conclusion, that the
same might hold good with respect to iron under similar circumstances;
so with perfect confidence in the justness of his views, he purchased, as
soon as an opportunity offered,                          all
                                          the iron, amounting      fifteen tons,             to

                           RED OXIDE OF PHOSPHORUS.
   M. Pelouze      observes,  that there remains after the combustion of
phosphorus, a red insoluble residue, which has generally been re
garded as an oxide of phosphorus.            M. Pelouze prepared this sub
stance in the mode     proposed    by Berzelius,    which consists in melting
phosphorus in boiling water, and passing a current of oxygen gas
into it; the phosphorus burns under water, phosphoric acid is formed
and dissolves, and the oxide of phosphorus floats in the liquor in the
form of cinnabar-red flocks. When the combustion ceases, the clear
acid liquor is poured off, the oxide is washed and put into a retort;
water passes over first, and afterwards the phosphorus which had ad
hered to the oxide; this remains in the retort, and is to be separated
from a little phosphoric acid by water.
   The oxide thus obtained was exposed for three days to a vacuum
over sulphuric acid to dry          The properties

they are heated together, the results are the phosphoric and sulphurous
acids. The nitric and nitrous acids attack it with extreme energy; they
inflame it suddenly, and convert it into phosphoric acid : this is re
markable, considering that the red oxide resists the influence of heat
and air much better than phosphorus, upon which cold nitric acid has
scarcely any action.
   It is probable that the extreme energy of this combustion depends
upon the minute division of the oxide, and that phosphorus would
exhibit similar phaenomena if it were possible to obtain it in very fine
powder.
   The red oxide of phosphorus thrown into either dry or moist
chlorine suddenly inflames, and phosphoric acid and perchloride of
phosphorus are formed. It detonates with extreme violence when put
in contact in the cold with chlorate of potash.     Sulphur decomposes
it only when near                   its
                       fusing point, and without detonation. The oxide

phaenomenon in interference, whilst repeating, in a new mode,
an experiment first described by Professor Powell in a former
Number of the Philosophical Magazinet.              The experiment
consists in  placing   a  prism   of  glass  in the direction of two
pencils of light which interfere; these pencils arising from
the reflection of the light which diverges from the image of
the sun, given by a lens of short focus, by two mirrors slightly
inclined to each other. Professor Powell, by using a prism
with a refracting angle of only a few degrees, and common
light, believed that he found the same parts of the luminous
pencils to interfere, after refraction by the prism, which would
have interfered if it had not been interposed, and that the
                                           º
only alteration was in the direction of the pencils, produced
by the refraction.    I saw that this experiment merited a more

 82                     Mr. R. Potter             on a   particular Modification
   angle about 43 degrees.          By using a homogeneous light pro
   duced by a coloured solution and two plane mirrors of spe
   culum metal, or rather one mirror polished as for a New
   tonian telescope and then cut into two across the middle,                                                      I
   obtained sufficient brightness to trace readily the whole phae
   nomena. I immediately found that Professor Powell’s con
   clusion from using the prism with a small angle, was prema
   ture, and that the same portions of the pencils did not interfere
   after refraction which would have interfered before, if the
   prism had not been interposed; but that interference then
   took place between rays which had passed at a greater                                                     di
   stance from the angle of the prism.             Another phaenomenon
   which greatly attracted my attention was, that when the eye
  and eye-glass were withdrawn further from the prism, the                                                   in
  terference occurred between other parts of the pencils which
  had passed at still greater distances; and that when the eye
  and eye-glass were withdrawn still further,                   appearances            all
 of   interference      length atceased.      This last effect arose where
  the prism became too narrow                allow         to
                                                       sufficient breadth   a                                 of
  the pencils      pass, to    when the mirrors were not sufficiently
                                        or
  inclined          to
                each other       give the required overlapping
                                             to                            the                          of
  pencils for interference         take place to     such     distance from
                                                                       at             a

                                                      or
                                                                                               of by
 the edges              of
                  the mirrors give         certain criterion
                                                         a          which                                     to
judge         of
             this other   interfering  light;   and     the act     drawing  in
 the   eye  and  eye-glass   from the    prism,   we see the    phaenomena
 which we consider traverse gradually over those inflected                                                    or
 diffracted bands, and finally become                 gradually lost    as the                          in
 single light                of
                      the other mirror.          This    appearance     takes
 place whatever may            the angle be     which the pencils emerge
                                                                at
 from the prism. Another fact which demands equal attention
 is,  that the breadths          the fringes produced
                                             of                   the inter                by

 the prism: thus from the angle                            of

 how we    may   expect     interference        take   place,      the theory
                                                                  to                       on
 that the  phaenomena           light      of
                                       arise from the effects            subtile            of  a
 matter which          emitted
                           is                     by
                                      luminous bodies. The discovery
 of interference renders certain conditions now essential in
every theory          light. These are: 1st, That luminiferous sur
                           of
 faces expand     around each luminous point, which expanding
surfaces tend             near spherical form
                           to    as         a             the circumstances     as
of   the luminous body permit.
    2nd, That these luminiferous surfaces,                   shells, succeed     or
each other        regular
                      at     intervals,which     differ for the different co
Hours       of
            the spectrum, and are for each colour exactly the
double       of
              Newton's fits                     of
                                     easy reflection and transmission.
    Those who admit the material theory                     light, generally     of
allow that    light  and heat are      mutually    convertible;     and many
facts may             be
                   adduced which confirm this view.                Now heat
                                                                            light

perpetually radiates without causing any impression
in  the  eye,  and we must        suppose    that interfering    rays       light
produce           an
                 effect        the     on
                                     organ       vision similar   of    radiant                 to
heat;       so
            that when two rays arrive             the same path    on    juxta                   in
position, they cease, either                           by
                                         their combined bulks being too
large,      or    by
                 some other        property    unknown          us,       create      to         to
that sensation which we call            light.    That the    eye  has only                                  a
very limited power            appreciating the impressions which may
                                      of
 be  conveyed          to       it,
                         the advocates                        of
                                               every theory must allow.
    There        isfundamental difference, however, between this
                      a
way    ofviewing interference and that adopted               the undulatory          on

                    this view the rays would neutralize each other's
effect, while              on

84.         Mr. R. Potter   on a  particular Modification
with nature, and for which they have offered but very unsatis
factory arguments,      I must claim as strongly in favour of the
view which I have proposed. There are, indeed, cases in which
the undulatory theory affords a direct application, as in the
transmitted colours of thin plates, and in the fringes within the
shadows of narrow bodies: but on a careful review we must
 allow that these cases arise in less simple circumstances than
 those exceedingly numerous ones in which the claim of half an
 undulation has to be made.
      Having shown how interference may arise according to the
 theory that light is caused by an emitted matter,       I shall pro
 ceed to the mathematical      investigation  of the experiment  with
 the prism, which has been before described.
      To find the central points of interference after the refrac
  tion of the pencils by the prism, requires the previous conside
  ration of three distinct questions; namely, 1st, The positions
  of the secondary images of the luminous point, or the centres
  of divergence of the rays after the two refractions: 2nd, The
  simultaneous positions of the luminiferous surfaces: 3rd, The
                                    j,
  figure of the curve of the principal section of these surfaces;
  —the plane of this section being common to both pencils.
       The first question involves        the common rules of optics;
   the other two   require, in  addition,  the application of the re
   spective theories as to the velocity with which the light passes
  through the substance of the prism.
       From the properties of the prism we cannot rigorously
   consider the light which emanates from a luminous point
   before refraction to do so afterwards, excepting for very small
   pencils near the angle of minimum deviation; for which rea
         I
   son shall only investigate the principal part of the problem
   on this supposition, of exceedingly small pencils, incident on
   the prism near the angle of minimum deviation.            I do not
   nevertheless consider that it would lead to objectionable re
    sults for other incidences: in making the corresponding ex
   periments, however, some care would be requisite to be taken,
    to preserve the direction of the bands perfectly parallel to the
    line bounding the angle of the prism. We find that inter
    ference, according to the rules, is not prevented by even the
    great degree of aberration which exists in the focus of the lens
    we use to form an image of the sun, and which, though of
    considerable dimension, we consider in calculation as a lumi
    nous point. The effect of these imperfections generally tends
    to render the phaenomena less distinct and less sharply ex
    hibited; or, where it was required to determine whether the
    central band were a bright or a dark one, this aberration would
    present a serious obstacle.

 - To find the positions of the secondary images of the lu
minous point after the passage of the small pencils through
the prism, we will suppose one of the primary images at o,
fig. 2; then after refraction at the first surface the pencil will
diverge as from another point p, such that r being put for the
distance or, and r" for the distance p r, we have

tise on Optics, I shall here use them without further explana

through, we have for r or q s this equation:

   Supposing, therefore, the black precipitate to be a hydrate
of platina, it would appear by my experiments to be a com
pound of about four atoms of the metal and one atom of water.
Now the existence of a hydrate so constituted is not only of                                                   it
self extremely improbable, but is rendered still more unlikely
by the supposition that a metal without previous oxidizement
should form a hydrate at all; for it is quite as contrary to ex
perience that a metal and water should combine, as that a metal
and an acid should unite, without the intervention of oxygen.
     Iam therefore disposed to consider the 1:41 per cent. of
water which remains with the black powder, after being heated
to 212°, as in a state of mixture, and not of combination. There
are other circumstances which strengthen this conclusion :
If  the black powder be strongly pressed or rubbed in a glass
mortar, the metallic appearance of platina is as perfect before
as after the application of a red heat; and I conceive this could
scarcely occur if it were chemically combined with water.
That the platina is in the metallic state in the black powder,
is proved by              its
                        total insolubility        nitric     muriatic acid,
                                                               in                   or
even when first      precipitated,   and before          dried. Another

circumstance which induces me                believe thatto       not hy                it   is        a

                answering most perfectly the purpose                 spongy                   of

ture      of
           oxygen and hydrogen gases; indeed                appears       me       it                    to
to       be  excellent preparation for these purposes, and
              an                                                                                           it   is
procured with very great facility.
     It   isprobable that some other metals whose affinity for
oxygen        weak, may also          precipitated

 I passed it into lime-water and obtained a plentiful precipi
 tate; it is probable therefore that the hydrogen of the tartaric
 acid combines with the oxygen of the platina, and thus re
 duces it to the metallic state; whilst the carbon and oxygen
 of the tartaric acid form carbonic acid gas,

   Quail-On the 29th of December a Quail was killed near
Kirkbride, a small village within a short distance of Solway
Firth; and notwithstanding the time of the year, it was in most
excellent condition, and proved, upon dissection, to be a male.
   We are induced to record this circumstance, as it confirms
the statement we made in our notice of this species for the
year 1829, that              “a
                      few have been known to remain over the
winter*.”
   9. Turtle Dove (Columba Turtur).-A Turtle Dove was
killed in Blackwell Wood on the 18th of September. It was
a young bird, being entirely destitute of the black patch on
each side of the neck.   This is the first specimen we have
seen that has been obtained in this neighbourhood, although
we have been informed that it has been met with at Woodside,
and one or two other places; it is however of very rare occur
rence in this county.
   17. Honey Buzzard (Pernis apivorus).-We were shown a
specimen of this elegant bird on the 17th of November, by
a dealer in this place, who states that it had been killed
about the middle of October last near Raughton Head.                It
was evidently a very young bird, and agreed in every respect
with the description given by Temminck, of                 jeunes                       les               de

which we trust will induce ornithologists         examine this bird to
with greater attention, and consequently the more readily lead
to the detection      of
                      these two species.

are not altogether free from objection;           one      two  as the        or            of

   102      Meteorological Remarks for 1832, at Carlisle.
  gular variety of the Lapwing was obtained near the canal re
  servoir on the 13th of March. This specimen, which was a
  male, had the whole of the back and wing-coverts white,
  interspersed here and there with a few feathers of the usual
  colour.
      204. Razor Bill (Alca Torda).- A remarkably fine adult
  specimen of this bird was killed on the river Eden, near the
  village of Beaumont, on the 18th of April.          Young Razor Bills
  are occasionally met with in this district; but the old birds
  are exceedingly rare.
     211. Northern Diver (Colymbus glacialis).—On the 13th of
  December a young male of the year of this bird was shot on
  the river Eden, within a very short distance of Carlisle, and
 nearly upon the very same spot where a very similar Northern
 Diver was killed on the 21st of January 1789*.
     219. Fork-tailed Petrel (Procellaria Bullockii).—The first
 specimen of this bird that has been detected in this neigh
 bourhood, was found dead upon the coast near Cardurnock,
 on the 17th of December. Not very many years ago the
 Fork-tailed Petrel was considered one of the rarest of the
 British birds, but within these last few years several have been
 met with from time to time in various parts of the kingdom;
 and during the latter end of the year 1831 it appears to have
 visited this country in very considerable numbers, and is stated
 to have been obtained amongst others at the following places;
 WIZ.
     One found dead near Chipping Norton, Oxon; two on the
 banks of the river Severn, Gloucestershire; several in the
 vicinity of London.
     One found dead not far from Rington, Hertfordshire; four
 found dead a short distance from York; three or four in the
 vicinity of Halifax.
     One shot on the river Tyne, near Newcastle; two or three
 in the neighbourhood of Plymouth; one or two on the coast
 of Cornwall; one at Thirsk, Yorkshire.
    One contiguous to Hanbury, Worcestershire; one or two
near Hull, &c. &c.f.

and again from the 4th to the 12th of April; the remainder,
however, of this month was for the most part gloomy and
exceedingly cold, and on the 25th the summit of Cross Fell
was pretty thickly covered with snow.    During the first three
weeks of   May,  keen  cutting winds prevailed  generally from
the East; on the 2nd, there was snow several inches in depth
in the vicinity of Tindal Fell, and on the 15th and 16th we
had several smart hail-showers; in short, it was not before the
22nd that the weather became at all warm and seasonable.
   Vegetation, as might naturally be expected, made but little
progress; and upon the whole the spring of this year was per
haps more backward than the very late one of 1829.
   The summer and autumn which followed, however, were fine
and remarkably dry, the harvest early, and the crops in this
district, generally speaking, were exceedingly good, more
particularly on cold elevated grounds, where the farming pro
duce was scarcely ever recollected to have been more abun
dant, or to have been secured in finer condition.

XIX.    Abstract of the principal Demonstrations of M. Fourier,
  relative to the Mathematical Law of the Radiation of Heat.
  By Baron MAURice, Member of the Institute of France, and
  Professor of Analytical Mechanics in the Academy of Geneva.

        My Dear Sir,
THE       précis of Fourier's Demonstrations, from which the
  following      translation is taken, was put into my hands in
manuscript, by my friend Baron Maurice of Geneva, last
month.    It was written for the Supplement to M. Prevost's
work on Heat, which has since appeared. As I have not ob
served any account of this part of Fourier's labours in Eng
lish works (and, indeed, the writings of that distinguished
man are too little known in this country), I think the present
notice may not be unacceptable; more especially as the ori
ginal Memoir of Fourier, in the fifth volume of the Memoirs
of the Institute, is really obscure. In this tract M. Maurice
has reduced the theory to a few simple propositions, which he
has given with            all
                       that copiousness       of
                                            reasoning which            di
stinguishes the writings        Fourier, when

der different angles from the same point of the surface of any
body, have an intensity which decreases proportionally to the
sine of the angle formed by their direction with the plane tan
gential to the surface, at the point of emission.”

the wave-surface only in the two points just mentioned; and
consequently that a single ray, proceeding from a point with
out a biaxal crystal, and refracted in the direction of the optic
axis, would necessarily be divided into two, determined by the
points of contact. Professor Hamilton, however, has shown
that the four planes in question touch the wave-surface, not
in two points only, but in an infinite number of points, consti
tuting each a small circle of contact, whose plane is parallel to
one of the two circular sections of the surface of elasticity; and
 that, consequently, a single ray of common light, proceeding
from an external point, and refracted in the required direction,
 ought, if the theory be true, to be divided within the crystal
into an infinite number of rays, constituting a conical surface.
     Here then are two singular and unexpected consequences
 of the undulatory theory, not only unsupported by any phae
nomena hitherto noticed, but even opposed to                   the analo       by
 gies derived from experience.                   If

the come just mentioned. The remote cone then disappeared,
and the circular arch diminished; and, as the obliquity of the
line to the axis was further increased, these two luminous por
tions merged gradually into the two pencils into which a sin
gle ray is divided in the other parts of the crystal.
      The same experiments were repeated by bringing the flame
of the lamp close to the first surface of the crystal.                  In this
 case the lens was removed, and the incident cone of rays
 formed by covering the surface of incidence with a thin me
 tallic plate perforated with a minute aperture. The results
 were perfectly similar to those obtained in the former case.
      But to apply a yet more palpable test to this theory,                                            I
 substituted a narrow linear aperture for the point, in the plate
 next the lamp; and fixed it so that the plane passing through
  the line on the first plate and the point in the second, should
  be the plane of the optic axes.          In this case, according to the
  received theory,         the rays transmitted through the two aper
                            all
  tures should         be
                       refracted doubly        the plane
                                                       in       the optic axes,
                                                                              of

       that               the line should                               breadth             in
        looking through the second aperture; whereas, according
        Professor Hamilton's beautiful deduction from the same
   theory, the ray proceeding                 in
                                          the direction               optic axis  of   an

                                   in  plane    passing    through    that line.
    In accordance with this conclusion found,          I      looking throughon
   the second aperture, that the luminous line was undilated,
   except    in the direction       one of         of
                                              the optic axes; and that

 and R.— 13° 54'49".           Now the difference of these angles, or
 3° 0'  38", may    be called the angle of the cone; and half the sum,
 or 15° 25'    8",   is the mean angle of emergence.             The angle
 15° 58', found above, differs from this by 33' only; but the ob
 served angle of the cone is about double of that given by theory.
     I also measured the angle of the cone by receiving it on a
 screen of roughened glass at different distances, and tracing
 the outline of the section on the screen : the diameter of this
 section and the distance being then measured, the angle was
 determined. Three measurements taken in this manner gave
 for the magnitude of that angle respectively 6°24', 5° 56',
 6° 22', the mean of which, 6° 14', agrees very nearly with that
 determined by the former method.
    Conceiving that the difference between experiment and
theory arose chiefly from the rays which were inclined to the
optic axis          all

branches of what is called the Live-oak, of East Florida, are

    The most beautiful specimens that England affords, of plants
with wide-spreading branches, are undoubtedly those of the
 Beech-tree; and the finest we have ever had an opportunity
of admiring, are those in Eastwell Park, Kent, a seat of the
 Earl of Winchelsea.      Expanding their aged and venerable
arms in the full maturity of their growth, dignified in their
elevation, and clothed with the pleasing verdure of their glossy
leaves, they excite in the breast of the spectator emotions ap
proaching to those of the sublime; and yet they are not so
conspicuously remarkable for vastness of dimension as for
beauty and symmetry of contour.       The measurement of one
of the handsomest of them was as follows: girth of the trunk,
 close to the soil, from eighteen to twenty feet; height,
clear of branches, from seven to eight feet; horizontal growth
 of the lower branches, thirty-six feet, which, with half the
 width of the stem, gives a semidiameter of thirty-nine feet,
 and consequently a diameter of seventy-eight feet; slanting
 extent of the upper branches, such as to give to the group a
 sort of globular contour, as regular as if it had been clipped
 with shears, with an estimated elevation of from fifty to sixty
 feet. Think of the cooling and delightful shade afforded by
 this ample expansion, as filled up with      summer garniture   its
of  leaf and flower, and you  have   type  before you similar

now agreed to regard it as an involucrum.              The Scale is a
thin, chaffy, and membranaceous substance, forming part of the
fructification of a variety of plants that produce incomplete
flowers, and constituting their calyx.        It may be seen in the
catkins of the Willow and in the cones of the Fir.              In the
former it is a  proper   calyx, in the latter it is a common calyx.
   The Corolla is the interior envelope of the flower, investing
the central parts, but invested by the calyx.          It is generally
of a finer and more delicate texture than the         calyx,  and is of
all the parts      the fructification the most showy and orna

figure, surmounted with a small bag or viscus, and situated
immediately within the corolla, to which they are sometimes
attached.    A very good example of them may be seen by
opening up the blossom of a Tulip or of a Lily. They are
apparently of no importance in the eye of the vulgar spectator,
but are essential to the botanical notion of a flower, because
indispensable to the formation of perfect fruit.   The calyx is
sometimes wanting, and the corolla is sometimes wanting; or
the calyx and corolla both, as in Euphorbia; but the stamens
are never wanting, except through adventitious or accidental
causes.    On the number of stamens, Linnaeus has founded
the first twelve classes of his artificial method; so that if any
flower is furnished with but one stamen, it is to be referred to
the first class; if with two, to the second class; if with three,
to the third, and so on in succession.     The remaining classes
are founded on other peculiarities.
   Stamens are usually regarded as consisting of two parts, a
 filament and an anther. Yet the filament is not an indispen
 sable part of the apparatus of a flower.              There are many
 flowers without a filament, but no flower without an anther.
 It is a viscus of one or more cells containing a powder, which
 botanists denominate the pollen, and which, at the period of
 the maturity of the flower, bursts         integuments and explodes.

fracture of the umbilical cord.      Linnaeus gave it the appella
tion of the Hilum, which the term scar translates.
    The number of seeds produced by a single flower is ex
 tremely different in different plants.     In some plants a flower
produces only one seed; in others two, in others three, and
in others many. But the great fertility of some species is
altogether astonishing.     A single stalk of Zea Mays will pro
duce two thousand     seeds";  a single plant of Inula Helenium,
three thousand; and a single spike of Typha major, ten thou
sand. A single plant of Tobacco has been found, by calcula
tion, to produce the almost incredible number of 360,000+;
a single stalk of Spleen-wort has been thought, by estimation,
to produce at least a million of seeds.
    Like bulbs, seeds are also extremely tenacious of potential
life.   If well preserved from the action of the atmosphere,
they will retain their vitality for thousands of years.    Among
the mummies lately unswathed in this country, one was found
to grasp in          its
                 hand some grains        Egyptian wheat.

from a Committee of their Members: as the persons who are
selected for this duty are frequently veterans in their respective
sciences, who have earned by their labours an European reputation,
the Reports which are thus produced prove often more valuable than
the original communications upon which they are founded, and the
collections of them, as is well known, form a most important part of
the stock of modern science.               Many other advantages also have
been found to result from the            adoption     of this practice. The deci
sions of men who are elevated              by  their character and reputation
above the influence of personal feelings of rivalry or petty jealousy,
possess an authority sufficient to establish at once the full import
ance of a discovery, to fix           relations   its  the existing massto      know                       of

In   other countries, however, where the learned professions are nei
ther richly paid nor highly honoured, and where the exclusive cul
tivation of particular branches of literature and science presents the
readiest access to the possession of competence and social rank, we
find large bodies of men who have no professional engagements
whatever to divert them from their literary and scientific labours,
which are thus made to constitute the business of their lives.            am                             I
fully sensible of the great advantages which other countries possess
in these respects above our own, and that it is quite impossible for
us to command an equal concentration of attention to the advance
ment of particular branches of science, or to the concerns of a par
ticular Society; still less so when it is considered that those services
must with us, be afforded gratuitously, which, in other countries, are
remunerated by the State, or are required as part of the duty of a
salaried office:—we are not less called upon, however, on this account,
to make the best and most efficient use of the means in our power,
and the assistance which we cannot command as due from a sense
of official or professional obligation, we may receive as rendered
from a higher feeling of devotion to the promotion of the general
interests of science, and with it of our national fame.

    However much may lament the want of establishments, in this
 country, for the exclusive and liberal support of men of learning and
 of science, and however anxiously                         I
                                            may look forward to the time

 an evil, yet I rejoice to observe amongst       ranks     society allzealous       of          so

 science, appear to entitle them to particular notice.
   | Sir Everard Home, Bart., was born at Hull on the 6th of May 1756.
 He was the youngest son of Robert Home, a surgeon in the army,
 and descended from the Barons of Polwarth, the ancestors of the Earls
 of Marchmont in Scotland; he was educated at Westminster School,
 and though elected off as a scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge, in
  1773, he never went there, having abandoned his prospects in college
 upon the invitation of the celebrated John Hunter, who had recently
 married his eldest sister, and who offered to superintend his educa
 tion in surgery and human and comparative anatomy, and gave him
 the free use of his unrivalled collections. Under his auspices he con
 tinued to study for several years, availing himself at the same time
 of the lectures and instructions of the most eminent anatomical and
 medical teachers of his day. He went to the West Indies upon the
 medical staff in 1780, where he remained for four years; upon his
 return to England in 1784, he continued to assist Mr. Hunter in
 the arrangement and completion of his museum, and also in his
 various official duties until his death, which took place in 1793.
 Mr. Home was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1785; in 1808 he
was made sergeant-surgeon to the King, and in the same year he re
ceived the Copley Medal for his various papers on Anatomy and
Physiology, printed in the Philosophical Transactions.          In 1812
he was created a baronet, being the first surgeon in actual practice
upon whom that honour had been conferred.
     In 1821 he was appointed surgeon to Chelsea Hospital, and in
the following year he was elected President of the College of Sur
geons. In the year 1827 he began to retire from the practice of
his profession, and from most of his official employments; and he
died at his residence in Chelsea College in August last, in the 77th
year of his age.
     Sir Everard Home was the author of 107 papers in the Transac
tions of this Society, a number exceeding that of any other contri
butor.      He published Lectures upon Comparative Anatomy, in six
volumes quarto; the two first in 1814, the third and fourth in 1823,
and the two last in 1828. They consist chiefly of the results of his
papers in the Transactions of this Society, with a republication of
the splendid plates, by the permission of the Society, by which
many of them were illustrated.       He was also the author of several
other works upon different subjects of anatomy and surgery; and
he published in 1797, Memoirs of John Hunter, who had be
queathed to him    all  his papers.
     Sir Everard Home must be considered     as   the successor of John
Hunter, and   in    every way most closely connected with him. He

like many other ardent young men of that period, an admirer of the
principles      of that great national movement; and the

answer which appeared in that age to Mr. Burke's celebrated                   Re
flections, and gained for him, at once, both at home and abroad, a
distinguished reputation.            The atrocities, however, which marked
the more advanced stages         of the French Revolution, his own in
creasing experience and knowledge of mankind, and still more his
 frequent intercourse with his illustrious adversary, for whose genius
he had always professed a chivalrous admiration, however much he
 had opposed his views and his reasonings, combined to sober down
the fervent enthusiasm of his own youthful speculations and hopes;
 and the principles which he avowed and vindicated in his celebrated
defence of Peltier in 1802, must be considered as those which he
 adopted as the result of the convictions of his maturer age, and
 which he continued to maintain through life.        In 1803 he was ap
 pointed Recorder of Bombay, where he resided for seven years, and
 where he secured the affection and admiration both of natives and
of foreigners, by the able, impartial, and considerate discharge of his
judicial functions. Upon his return from India in 1811, he was
 elected Member of Parliament for Knaresborough, a place which
 he continued to represent for the remainder of his life.
    Few persons of his own age had read so much as Sir James
 Mackintosh, or remembered what they had read so well. His con
 versation was singularly instructive and brilliant, without being
overbearing; his manners were conciliating; his temper excellent;
and he was entirely tolerant of opinions which were different from
his own. He was one of the most distinguished Members of the
House of Commons; and his speeches upon                     all

                              in            remarkable,    not merely for

ferent military and civil capacities, in various parts of India. In the
year 1804 he was appointed principal Resident at the Court of My

the financial condition, resources, and many other subjects connected
with the administration of the government of that country. He was
the author of “Historical Sketches of the South of India, in an

or species. To a perfect naturalist, therefore, the inspection of
a bone, or any other part of an animal, would bring to his mind
the entire animal itself, and would identify it as perfectly as if
it was exhibited entire to his eye : this would be a triumph of
science to which our limited knowledge and faculties can never com
pletely attain; but it was to this point that Cuvier approximated,
when he reconstructed as it were the fossil animals of an antediluvian
world from the imperfect fragments which remained of them; when
he showed in what such animals must have differed, and in what
they must have agreed, whether in magnitude or in kind, from the
animals which exist at present; when he ventured in fact to define
their habits, and to write as it were the natural history of a former
world, by throwing upon                             its

    Nov. 7, 1832–The Society                                       assembled this evening for the session.
    A paper         was first read,                  “On some
                                       Intersections of Mineral Veins
in Cornwall,” in a letter to Davies Gilbert, Esq. M.P. F.G.S. F.R.S.
&c., by William John Henwood, Esq. F.G.S.
   The chief object of this communication is to lay before the reader
particular facts bearing upon certain theories respecting the disloca
tion of veins; and the author in pursuance of his intention first states
the theory as a question, and then adduces his facts.    The following
are the  principal propositions.
   1. When one vein is dislocated by another, is it to be found on the
side of the smaller or larger angle
   At Bulls, in the Herland mine, two veins are heaved by a cross
course; and one of them was rediscovered on the side of the smaller
angle, and the other on the side of the larger angle.
   2. When one vein dislocates several others, are      the latter    be                              all                        to

Counties of Mayo and Sligo,” by the Venerable Archdeacon Vers
choyle, and communicated by Roderick lmpey Murchison, Esq. P.G.S.
was also begun.
    Nov. 21–The reading of Archdeacon Verschoyle's paper, begun
at the meeting held on the 7th of November, was concluded.
   The author divides his memoir into two parts ; in the first he gives
a topographical description of the country, and in the second a detailed
account of the different formations of which it is composed.
    I. The district described is situated in the western part of the pro
vince of Connaught, and is bounded on the N. and W. by the Atlantic.
Through the eastern portion a primary chain, called the Ox moun
tains, having a mean height of 1300 feet, extends in a N.E. and S.W.

    The author, having noticed the various memoirs and works which
 have appeared on the organic remains of the fossil reptiles of Sus

Iguana, the back of the animal was armed; but at the same time he
mentioned many anatomical peculiarities, which led him to hesitate
in determining positively that these bones had formed such appen
dages. He next entered upon a careful examination of the reasons
why they could not be processes of the vertebrae.         Many dermal
bones, which served to support the large scales, were discovered by
the author in the stone. The author proposed forming a new genus
for this animal, the characters of which would depend on the pecu
liarity of the sternal apparatus and the spinous processes; and he
suggested the name of Hylaeosaurus, or Forest-Lizard, to indicate
 itslocality, the Forest   Tilgate.  of              In

   Excepting between Berne and Thun, in an autumn morning in
1814, we have never seen a fog-bow.      It was formed, however, by
the rays of the sun; and in so far as we remember, a fog-bow formed
by the lunar rays has never been described.                 D. B.
ON       THE SENSATION  PRODUCED   UPON THE TONG UE                                      BY
           MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.  BY MR. F. WATKINS,

    Gentlemen,
   Among the several electrical effects exhibited by natural, artificial,
steel, and electro-magnets, none are in my estimation more curious
than that produced on animals. Dr. Faraday in his excellent paper
on experimental researches in electricity, published in the Phil. Trans.
of the past year, observes, in page 138, that when using an armedload
stone of great power, belonging to Prof. Daniell, he convulsed a frog
powerfully, and adds with a diffidence so peculiarly his own, that                       “I
thought also I could perceive the sensation upon the tongue, and the
flash before the eyes.” That this eminent philosopher did observe
the phaenomenon in a slight degree (at this moment) there can be no
doubt; but as the effect was feeble, in consequence of the exciting
cause not being sufficiently powerful, he alludes to it in the manner
here quoted.
    Through the kindness andliberalityof the proprietors of the National
Gallery of Practical Science, Adelaide Street, West Strand, I have
seen and performed several magneto-electric experiments with great
success, with their superb artificial steel magnet; and as I have not
noticed in print anywhere else than in Dr. Faraday's paper, that the
tongue had been electrified             (if
                                    may use the expression)

   M. Matteuci found also, that when acetic acid, sulphuric acid, and
peroxide of manganese are mixed, no formic acid is produced, as when
some other vegetable acids are so treated; and he considers carbonic
oxide as a compound analogous to cyanogen, and susceptible of form
ing an acid by combining either with oxygen or with hydrogen.—

     In the fourth volume of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals
  (page 379) we announced the intention of the cultivators of Na
 tural History to commemorate by a public meeting the second cen
 tenary of the birthday of Ray, whose extensive and accurate
 labours laid the foundation for the philosophical study of organic
 nature in this country; and in the following volume we had
 the pleasure of recording the highly satisfactory accomplishment
 of that intention. We have now equal pleasure in announcing that
 the cultivators of Chemical Science are about to commemorate in
 a similar manner, the centenary of the birthday of that distin
 guished Philosopher of a later period, to whom—whether we re
 gard the invention of the apparatus requisite for researches on
 aëriform fluids, the investigation of the action of those fluids upon
 each other, or the number of them actually first discovered by him,
and his determination of their relation to the functions of animal
 and vegetable life—must be awarded the merit of being the Founder
 of Pneumatic or Gaseous Chemistry. The object of this notice is to
 give additional publicity to the following circular:-
    “Commemoration of Priestley.— A hundred years having elapsed
 since the Birth of the Philosopher whose extensive and successful
researches entitle him to be considered as the Founder of Pneumatic
 Chemistry, it has been resolved that the event shall be commemo
rated by a Public Dinner on the 25th of March; and the Committee
appointed upon the occasion, express a hope that                  those who      all
justly appreciate the high importance              Priestley's Discoveries,

siders to be inexplicable on the theory of undulations.   These
phaenomena are, in fact, a confirmation of the truth of that
theory, and might have been predicted from the theory.         I
should not therefore have troubled you with these remarks, if
I did not feel that the public is much interested in seeing a
distinct and correct interpretation put upon experiments
and calculations like those to which I allude; and if     I were
not convinced that Mr. Potter, whose labours as an experi
mentalist I value most highly, would feel any thing but pain
at my pointing out the error into which (I conceive) he has
fallen as a theorist.
    In Mr. Potter's experiment two pencils of light originating
from a common source are made to interfere by falling upon
two plane mirrors inclined at a small angle: the two reflected
pencils fall upon a prism whose edge is parallel to the line of
junction of the mirrors, and the interference-fringes, after
emergence, are examined by means of an eye-glass in the usual
manner. The light being supposed homogeneous, Mr. Pot
 ter finds (correctly) from the theory of undulations that the
 points, at which the paths of the pencils from the two images
 are equal, are almost exactly at the centre of the mixture

162                             Prof. Airy's Remarks
of the lights:    he infers that the centre of the mixture of lights
ought to be the centre of the interference-fringes; instead of
which it appears in experiment that on removing the eye and
eye-glass further and further from the prism, the interference
fringes deviate from the centre of the mixed light more and
more towards the thick side of the prism, and finally disappear.
And this discordance is the point now to be explained.
    Suppose now that the light is not homogeneous (the reasons
for believing that this supposition is true will be given pre
sently); and suppose only that the proportion of the differences
of the lengths of the waves, or if you please, of the lengths of
the fits, for     all
                   colours, from the length corresponding              some                              to
particular colour,        the same
                               is            the proportion   as   the dif                          of
ferences     ofthe deviation for those colours (produced                  the                             by

that particular colour.         This assumption           very nearly true           is

 The consideration, therefore,           homogeneous light will never
enable
         us
         to      determine which                   of is of
                                         the point that the eye imme
diately turns      to     as
                       the centre       the fringes. What then            the                             is
physical circumstance that determines the centre               the fringes?                    of
     The answer very easy. For different colours the bars have
                        is
 different breadths.         then the bars of all colours coincide
                                    If                                                                         at
 one part    ofthe mixture        light, they will not coincide
                                             of                           any                             at
 other part; but          equal distances
                               at                   both sides from that on
 place  of coincidence they will                        be
                                           equally far from the state                                          of
 coincidence.        then we can find where the bars of all colours
                    If
                                                              of of of
 coincide, that point       the centre
                                    is         the fringes.
  It   appears then that the centre         the fringes     not necessarily               is
 the  point  where the two      pencils       light  have described equal
 paths, but   is  determined                  by
                                     considerations          perfectly dif            of  a
 ferent kind.     And this         the radical error into which Mr.
                                          is
 Potter has fallen. The distinction               important     this and
                                                                     is                        in              in
 other  experiments.
     To find the centre                  of
                                 the fringes         Mr. Potter's experi  in
 ment, we must proceed thus:–First,                                      we
                                                    premise that the prism
 produces greater deviation for yellow rays than for red rays,
 and that the interference-bars are narrower for yellow rays
 than for red rays. Next, we allow that the centre                the mix                           of
 ture for each colour           point which the interfering pencils
                                    is   a

                       on Mr. Potter's Experiment on Interference.                                               163
of  that colour have reached by equal (or rather equivalent)
paths, and therefore is the place of a bright bar for that colour.
Lastly, as the interfering pencils for different colours are made
to deviate unequally by the prism, the centres of the mixture,
for different colours, will not occupy the same place.
    From the last consideration it follows at once that the
centre of the mixture will not be the place of the centre of the
fringes, inasmuch as similar bars of the different colours are
not united there. To find the place where they are united
we must consider that the centre of the red mixture, being
the least deviated, has made the smallest progress towards the
thick side of the prism, but that                                its
                                           bars are the broadest: the
centre         of
            the yellow mixture has made the greatest progress,
but its bars are the narrowest.         number      of bars can there

of the prism.          Ifd and & b have the same proportion for rays of
                            &
different colours (which we have mentioned above to be very
nearly accurate), then in a given position of the eye-glass the
union of colours will be perfect at the place which we have
found for the centre of the fringes; and the same place would
be found for the centre of the fringes if a part of the colours
were abstracted, or if the light were made more nearly ho
mogeneous.
    It appears then that, according to the theory of undulations,
we ought to have precisely the phaenomenon which Mr. Potter
has observed, supposing the light heterogeneous.                  It appears
also that a diminution of the heterogeneity will not alter
the place of the centre of the fringes;                              its

fringes more than another.
    But this will not apply             Mr. Potter's experiment unless
                                                to

 go  further, and will assert that,            the face   on the experiment      of
itself,it
          is is certain that the light was heterogeneous.            And the
reason         simple and unanswerable, that             the light had been
                                                                         if

the centre         of  fringes would occupy the same place                                               as   if
 the light were (within certain limits) ever

    Make a small wooden frame (like a window-frame, or
rather like the frame of a schoolboy's slate, but smaller);
with a saw cut through the centres of two opposite sides and
unite them by hinges; keeping the parts in one plane, fix in
them a clear piece of glass with putty; and when it is well
bedded, cut it with a diamond along the line of the hinges.
The frame will now turn well, carrying two pieces of glass
of the same thickness almost exactly in contact at the turning
line.     Fix one side of the frame so that the glass in it re
ceives, perpendicularly, the light which is to fall upon one of
the mirrors, and so that the line of the hinges divides the
pencils which fall upon the two mirrors.             One pencil will then
pass through the fixed glass and one through the moveable
glass. Now if the glasses are in the same plane, the inter
ference-fringes are not altered; but              while oneif,      perpendi       is

 the fringes become narrower as the prism is turned so as to
 increase much the angle of emergence,—is a direct consequence
of the theory of undulations. In fact, the light after emergence
comes from two virtual images more widely separated than
the first images; and the breadth of the fringes              catteris pa                     is,

    In   describing     student the relation between the versed

 subtracting the cosine from the radius when the arc           less                                      is

   In explaining to a young student in mechanics the motion
of elastic balls when one has impinged on another which was
at rest, we might perhaps make two separate cases distin
guished by the circumstances of the impinging ball being the
greater, or the impinging ball being the smaller; and we
should point out, that in the former case the motion of the
impinging ball after impact was in the same direction as be
fore; while in the latter case the motion after impact was in
the direction opposite to      first motion.   its
                                                more advanced                 A
student would   perceive that both were included   the general                        in
formula   A—B             v.    Thus      it    is    with the reflexion               of   light from

and the theoretical result       similar; namely, that whereas                                          in
one case we are bound                      to is
                                   suppose the remaining motion
(which  produces  the reflected ray)         retain the same directo
tion as before,    the other case we are equally bound
                          in                                      sup                          to
pose that the remaining motion has              direction opposite a                                    to
that which      had before.
                  it              lay smaller stress upon this part
                                           I

pare his experiments with the mathematical results derived
from the theory                of

science) that             he

    Sir D. Brewster                on the Action            of Light           upon the Retina.         169
Mr.    Smith, in the true spirit of philosophy, invites, and hope                                  I
I  shall do it with the impartiality which truth requires.
    In performing the fundamental experiment in candle-light,
I  find that the colour of the paper seen by the excited eye
varies with the distance of the image from the excited part of
the retina. When the image of the paper is at the furthest
possible distance from the luminous or exciting image, the
colour is yellowish, becoming greenish yellow, green, blue, dirty
purple, and finally disappearing as the image approaches to
the point of maximum excitation.—The cause of these changes
is obvious: the part of the retina least excited, because furthest
removed from the exciting cause, becomes insensible to the
red rays; nearer the point of excitation it becomes insensible
to the orange also, nearer still to the yellow, nearer still to the
                                                                                                         or or all
green, and so on, till close to that point it is insensible to
light whatever. Hence we have the paper first yellowish,
                     of of
   mixture         all the rays except red; next greenish yellow,
a a                          all
                   º
   mixture              the rays except red and orange; next green,
and    so  on with the other colours.
    Let      us
             now attend         the red image
                                          to          the unexcited eye.     in

170      Sir D. Brewster's Eramination of the      Phaenomenia
    Mr. Smith   has remarked (page 251, Exp. 1.), “that the
same   phaenomena   occur, and are even more vivid, if one of
the  eyes is exposed to the rays of the sun either direct or re
flected.”    According to my observations, however, the phae
nomena are quite changed in the latter case. The green image
becomes a bright blue, and the reddish image almost colourless
or white.    The colours are therefore not complementary, and
there is not even the appearance of an influence upon the
unexcited eye, whatever tinge there may be of redness in the
one image being merely the effect of contrast.
   This result enabled me to make a very decisive experiment.
I took two slips of paper, and having illuminated the one with
day-light, and the other with candle-light, I excited the right
eye with the light of a candle, and doubled the images.         The
slip illuminated with day-light gave one image blue and the
other white; while the slip illuminated with candle-light gave
one image green and the other reddish.          Now, in this experi
ment the   exciting  cause was the    same, and yet the colours were
different,-obviously proving that the colours depend upon the
nature of the light which falls upon the slip of paper, that
they are not complementary, and that when pure white light
is used the unexcited eye sees the paper colourless.
   These results may be confirmed by examining the red image
when the green image has become a dark purple by bringing
it close to the excited spot.       In this case the redness instead
of being increased is greatly diminished, and the slip appears
yellowish or cream-coloured. This arises from the want of
contrast, the green colour which heightened  -       the red having
almost   wholly  disappeared.
     Inow took two candles of equal brightness, and having
placed them at the distance of about four inches from each
other, and about two inches from the eyes,          I held a slip of
paper between them, and having doubled it by looking at a
more distant object, I found that both images were yellowish
green, not only when thus seen separately, but also when
combined into one. Now if the colours were complementary,
and if there was a balance of increased and diminished sensi
bility, the image must have been white.                               -
    Before quitting this part of the subject I may mention the
curious fact, that when the eyelid of the excited eye is closed
completely, and the eyebrow kept raised, before the exciting
light is applied to     it,
                         then when the light  is  applied, there will
 be  only one slip  of paper seen,  as  thereis  only one eye open;
and the colour     of this slip
                              is  certainly white   asusual: but the
moment       we
              open   the right  eye, withdrawing the exciting light
at  the same time, the slip seen     by   the newly opened eye    isa

bright green, (though the light passed only through the eye
lid,) and fully as green as if the eye had been open;—and
what is interesting, the other white slip instantly becomes
reddish, which now can only happen from contrast.
     I
     have mentioned in a former paper (vol. i. p. 172.), that
a stick of red sealing-wax seen by a highly-excited part of
the excited eye was of a dark liver colour; while to the other
eye     colour was brilliantly red. By substituting the follow
         its
ing coloured fluids      place    the slip   paper, and illumi

 the slip of paper are colourless.      A bright light is held as
 near the eye  as possible, so as to be seen with perfect distinct
 ness, and a slip of paper illuminated by a candle held above
 the head is placed between the exciting light and the eye, and
 so near the latter as to be seen double. In this experiment,
 which he has repeated often with the utmost care, the images
 of the slip of paper are perfectly colourless, the one seen by
 the exposed eye being only a little darker than the other.
 “In performing this experiment,” says Mr. Smith, “great
 caution is required that the exposed eye be adapted correctly
 to the distinct vision of the flame; for by much observa
 tion I have found that a small error in this respect, such as
 occurs when the eye becomes dazzled, is sufficient to excite
 those changes in the sensibility to red light which have been
 proved to be the causes of the green and red appearances of
 the white paper.”

                                 at the side of the eye we hold
the light within two inches of the retina, and in the front of it
within six inches, then the degrees of illumination are as 4 to
36; so that a light nine times greater should be used in front
of the eye to produce, catteris paribus, the same effect.

 produce a decided deterioration in the tints of a fine pic
 ture.   Hence it is that we see paintings to most advantage
   when we view them through two blackened tubes held close
   to the eye.     By this means the colours are not only more bril
   liant, but faint lights are brought out which would otherwise
   have been overpowered by the action of lateral light upon the
   retina.    Ifwe turn a picture upside-down, and look at it with
   the head    inverted,   a similar effect is produced, because the
   image is received upon a part of the retina which is not so
   frequently used; and it is for the same reason that the colours
   of the sky and of the landscape near the horizon are so beau
  tifully seen by looking at them either between the legs, or be
  neath the arm with the head inverted.
      It is well known that the human complexion is seen to
  greater advantage in candle- than in day-light, unless the com
  plexions are very ruddy. This arises from there being so
  much more red in candle- than in day-light.              There are cer
  tain states, indeed, of the atmosphere, when dark blue clouds
  prevail, in which the ordinary complexion appears to great
  disadvantage; and persons in variable health are often de
  scribed as looking    ill, when the change arises from the prevail
  ing colour      ofthe clouds.
      When gas-lights were first introduced,               was  it common  a
 complaint among those who frequented the theatre, that they
 injured the personal appearance                 of
                                                the audience. This bad
  quality made them      so  unpopular, that        red colour was com
                                                      a

 glass. The effect, however, arose from the great quantity                                of
 light which was used, and from               influence upon the retina;
                                               its
 and if    the same intensity         of
                                       light had been obtained either
 from oil     or  from candles, the same effect would have been
 produced.       Our eyes are now          so
                                           much accustomed           the use   to
of    strong lights, that the retina         not

these gases, being the reciprocals of the square roots of the
densities, the density of air being assumed as unity.
   If the two gases are separated at the outset by a screen
having aperturesof insensible magnitude, the interchange of
“equivalent volumes of diffusion” takes place through these
apertures, being effected by a force of the highest intensity;
and if the gases are of unequal density, there is a consequent
accumulation on the side of the heavy gas, and loss on the
side of the light gas.      In the case of air, for instance, on the
one side of the screen, and hydrogen gas on the other, a pro
cess of exchanging 1 measure of air for 37947 measures of
hydrogen, through the apertures, is commenced, and continues
till the gases on both sides of the screen are in a state of uni
form mixture.        Experiments on this principle can be made
with ease and precision, as will appear in the sequel, and af
ford an elegant demonstration of the law.                    -   -
    There is a singular observation of Doebereiner, which che
mists seem to have neglected as wholly inexplicable, on the
escape of hydrogen gas by a fissure or crack in glass-receivers,
which belongs to this subject, and from which set out in the           I
inquiry. Having occasion, while engaged in his researches on
spongy platinum, to collect large quantities of hydrogen gas,
he accidentally made use of a jar which had a slight crack or
fissure in     it.He was surprised           find that the water

twelve hours, and that, after twenty-four hours, the height
the water was two inches two-thirds above the level of the
water-trough.        During the experiment neither the height                                of
the barometer, nor the temperature               the place, had sensibly

     In other experiments,               he

     On repeating Doebereiner’s experiment, and varying the
 circumstances, it appeared that hydrogen never escapes out
 wards by the fissure, without a certain proportion of air re
 turning inwards.       In the experiment, however, as originally
 performed, it is evident, that, as soon as the water rises in the
jar above        its
                 outer level, air will begin                                        be

     Atthe beginning of the experiment, the instrument con
tained 855 measures hydrogen, saturated with vapour at 62°;
in three minutes a contraction of 95 measures took place, and
in the course of an hour the diffusion was sensibly at an end.
The instrument, however, was exposed for two hours longer,
that the diffusion might certainly be complete.    During                                     in
tervals so short uniformity of temperature might be counted
upon, with certain precautions; and the variations in atmo
spheric pressure were generally so minute, that they might
be neglected with impunity. Corrections for temperature and
pressure might therefore be dispensed with, which was a great
advantage.    855 measures hydrogen were found eventually
to be  replaced by 226.5 measures air, both saturated with va
pour at 62°.

    New hydrogen gas was made for each experiment by the
 moderate action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc, and it was
 collected in the diffusion-instrument from the beak of the re
 tort.    The observations could not be made with so much ac
 curacy as to entitle us to place any reliance on more than two
 decimal places of the calculated diffusion-volumes.         A great
 variety of experiments were performed on the diffusion of
 hydrogen with the diffusion-bulbs employed above, and se
 veral others of similar construction, principally with the view
of discovering the cause of the slight variations in the re
sults, and why the quantity of return-air was pretty uniformly
somewhat less than the theoretical quantity, which has the
effect of increasing the proportion-       of the hydrogen diffusion
volume.
    It appears,   that when the stucco-plug is in a parched state,

the quantity of return-air is uniformly greater than it should
be. Thus 3-65 and 3:69 were the diffusion-volumes of hy
drogen deduced from an experiment, in the one case with a
plug which had been dried at 100°, and subsequently exposed
for several hours to the air, and in the other case, with a plug

     It
      is evident from this, that the air does not diffuse out
against so strong a pressure and the inward current of hy
drogen.
   When this jar, of which the capacity was 65 cubic inches,
was used as a diffusion-instrument, and filled over water with
hydrogen, one fourth of the hydrogen which it contained
escaped by diffusion into air in the first hour.      Now, we find
by the table,                 (p.
                   188.), that hydrogen penetrates the plug with
greater velocity when passing into       vacuum        into the ex

 hydrogen being least resisted in passing through the plug. The
 experiments on the permeability of the stucco by gases under
  pressure, above detailed, were projected with a view to settle
  this point among others; and they are evidently incompatible
  with such an application of the theory, for hydrogen passes
 2-4 times more swiftly, and not 3-8 times, as in the diffusion
 experiments.     Carbonic acid, too, permeates the plug, under
 pressure, as rapidly as air does, or even somewhat more ra
 pidly, for our results inclined to this side rather than to the
 other; whereas carbonic acid diffuses through the plug more
 slowly than air does, or is replaced by more than an equal

 XXVIII.    Notice of the Occurrence on a Stone Wall of a re
   markable Deposition of Ice, similar to that described in the
   preceding Number of the Philosophical Magazine.     By Pro
   fessor RigAUD.
                      To Sir David Brewster.
        Dear Sir,
            thing connected with an unusual fact is interesting
 EVERY
   in itself, and variations may assist in leading to the ex
 planation of it—no further apology seems requisite for offering
  the following notice to your consideration.
    The account in the last Number of the London and Edin
 burgh Philosophical Magazine, of a remarkable deposition of
 ice, immediately recalled to my recollection that I had once ob
 served the same phaenomenon, though not on vegetables.      The
description there given answers precisely to what saw : the  I
engraving, indeed, gives me the idea more of snowy white
ness than of the semi-pellucid icy appearance which occurred
in the instance which     Iwitnessed; but this may have arisen
from accidental circumstances”.
                                *
    On looking back to a memorandum which was made at the
time, I find that in 1821, between 11 and 12 at noon on the
18th of February, I observed the fact on a stone wall, with an
eastern aspect, in a lane of this place.    It occurred in many
parts, which were from three to six or seven feet from the
   * The engraving represents the            imperfectly.   It   was, as   Mr.
Rigaud describesit,semi-pellucid.—(H.)               -

 ground.      The portions of ice (with a single exception) were
 formed at the edges of the stones,—indifferently at the tops, the
 bottoms, or the sides, but the curvature was uniformly turned
 inward from the mortar. There was a single instance of for
 mation on the mortar itself, in which case the threads of ice
 were formed in an horizontal line, and I think (for of this             I
 made no memorandum) parallel to the layer of mortar.
     There was a considerable extent of old wall in the same
 situation, but the ice was only found on a part, which had
 been recently built. In looking back to the meteorological
journals kept at the Observatory, I find the following entries:
    1821. Feb. 17.  12°   30'

    May not, therefore, the new mortar be supposed to have
 supplied the moisture which was congealed by the radiation
               #.
 from the sharp edges of the new stones? and as water expands
 in freezing,            ice contracts after it is frozen, may not the
 curling form have been produced by the greater cold retained
 in the stone from the frost of the preceding night?

     of Ireland".

                             of prismatic interference, published in
 the last Number of the London and Edinburgh Philosophical
 Magazine (for February 1833), deserve attention; for, if cor
rect, they would furnish a formidable and, perhaps, fatal ob
jection against the undulatory theory of light.            I have not re
peated the experiments, but I have endeavoured to examine
the mathematical part of the question, and have obtained re
sults which differ from the mathematical results of Mr. Pot
ter, and which appear to show that the phaenomena described
by him are consistent with the undulatory theory.                 It may,
therefore, be useful to state briefly some of my results, in a
form adapted for comparison with those of which they profess
to be corrections.        In stating them, it cannot be supposed
that I intend     any   personal    attack on Mr. Potter, for whose
talents and industry       I  feel a sincere respect.

  Mr.    Potter believes it to be a mathematical consequence of
the undulatory theory of light, that when rays, in a plane per
pendicular to the edge of a prism of glass, diverge from a
luminous point in vacuo, and emerge from the prism after re
 fraction, into a vacuum again, the locus of the points simul
 taneously attained by the emergent light is a circle;—either
 rigorously, or at least with an accuracy sufficient for the     in
 vestigation of the positions of the central points of interference
 of two emergent streams of homogeneous light, which had set
 out together from two near luminous origins, namely, from
 the images of a luminous point formed by two plane mirrors
inclined at a small angle to each other:—from which he con
cludes that these central points of interference, in the given
plane perpendicular to the edge, are situated on a certain hy
perbola, tending towards the angle of the prism, whereas he
found by experiment a tendency from that angle.         I find, how
 ever, that in consequence of the prismatic aberration (which
 is greater than the aberration of a lens), the section of an emer
 gent wave differs sensibly from the circular form, and the time
 of arrival of the light at any proposed point of interference re
 quires a sensible correction; by allowing for which I find, as
 the locus of the points of central interference in the plane
 perpendicular to the edge, a curve not hyperbolic, and not
 tending towards but from the angle of the prism; so that the
 phaenomenon observed by Mr. -Potter is a consequence of the
 undulatory theory.
    To simplify the question I shall suppose, with him, that the
 linejoining the two near luminous origins is perpendicularly    bi
 sected by a line which, if considered as an incident ray, would
 undergo the minimum of deviation, and would emerge in a
 certain direction, which I shall take, as he does, for the axis
 of a ; supposing also, with him, that this emergent line passes
 through, or very near the edge, and measuring the positive
 ordinates y towards the thickness of the prism, while the po
 sitive abscissae w are measured from the incident towards the
emergent light.       The problem is then to find, at least ap
 proximately, the equation in r, y, of the locus of points of
 central interference, or of simultaneous arrival of the light from
 the two luminous origins, with the undulatory law of velocity;
and, in particular, to examine whether this locus tends to or
from the angle of the prism, by examining whether the ordi
 nate y decreases or increases, while the abscissa r increases
 from   itsvalue   atthe prism.
    Denoting,      Mr. Potter does, the coordinates
                  as                                   of   the pris–

 in which a is half the interval between the two near luminous
          and m is a positive number depending on the angle
 and index of the prism. Mr. Potter finds for the difference of
 times of arrival of the two streams of emergent light at any
 point a, y, not far from the axis of a, the expression
      w/a^+ (y-º-a)”          –    v.   (x-ma)*--(y—a)”                              –    m   a...       (1)
 and equating this expression to zero, he finds for the locus of
 the points of central interference, the equation of a common
 hyperbola, which may be put under the following approximate
 form,

 If then  this analysis were sufficient, it would show, as Mr.
 Potter has concluded, that y decreases, and that the locus tends
 towards the angle of the prism; whereas the experiment showed
 a contrary tendency.
    But I find, that on account of the prismatic aberration, the
 expression (1) for the difference of times of arrival, requires

MR:tionKANE   prepared iodide of platina by adding a solu
        of hydriodate of potash to a dilute solution of per
muriate of platina, the latter being in excess; a black preci
pitate was formed, which consisted of iodide of platina mixed
with the double chloride of potassium and platina; the latter
was dissolved by putting the precipitate into a large quantity
of water, and              it at a temperature of 200°. The insolu
ble residue was iodide of platina, which when cautiously dried
had the following properties:                            its
                                        colour was dull black, rather

198   Mr. Kane's Analysis of some                         Combinations              of Platina :
   Mr. Kane prepared the iodide of potassium and platina, by
adding an excess of the former in fine powder to a strong solu
tion of permuriate of platina; effervescence took place. Some
aether was immediately poured on the mass, and the whole
agitated for a few minutes; a black powder was formed, which
when separated by the filter was the double iodide, mixed with
some chloride of potassium.         This double salt, when pure,
is very  soluble in water,  the solution is of a magnificent claret
colour; it is not decomposed by evaporation, but yields a soft
crystalline mass; the form of the crystal could not be deter
mined. It is soluble in alcohol, but not in aether, and when it
is added to a strong aqueous solution, the aether precipitates
the salt in the state of a black powder; solution of potash
dissolves       it.                                                                                        -

platina mixed with iodide           potassium; the latter was dis
                                                of
solved      water; the solution
           in                                        by
                                       evaporation left 7-75 grains
of  iodide     potassium,

  Mr. W. Sturgeon              on the Theory                 of Magnetic Electricity. 201
 point out the similarity between these results and his. M. Las
saigne's   iodides of platina are two, --the prot-iodide and the
 bi-iodide; Mr. Kane's only iodide is a sesqui-iodide; M. Las
 saigne's iodide of platina and potassium contains 1 atom of
 bi-iodide of platina, and 1 atom of iodide of potassium;
 Mr. Kane's (of questionable accuracy), 1 atom of sesqui-iodide
 of platina, and 1 of iodide of potassium. M. Lassaigne men
 tions an hydriodate of aminonia and platina, consisting of 2
 atoms of bi-iodide of platina and 1 of hydriodate of ammonia.
 Mr. Kane has what he calls an iodo-platinate of ammonium,
 containing 5 atoms of sesqui-iodide of platina, and 1 atom
 of ioduret of ammonium.
    Mr. Kane seems to claim great credit for the more philo
 sophical manner in which he views the nature of the iodides
 of platina than M. Lassaigne does. M. Lassaigne “examined.
the compounds of iodide of platinum with iodide of potas.
sium, &c. as double iodides; whilst I investigated them as
iodine salts, in which the iodide of platinum is the electro
negative (acid) element,” &c. &c.     I confess I wish Mr. Kane
would return to the simpler views entertained by M.Lassaigne;

clature is proceeding, every month will produce a new lan
guage; for if when two iodides combine, one must be an acid
and the other a base,                 I
                          do not see why any compounds what
ever may not be at the same time acids, alkalies, and salts.                                          I

would observe, that in line 7, p. 310, vol. i. of the Dublin
Journal, in Mr. Kane's paper, iodide of potassium is printed
instead of iodide of platinum; and in p. 311, line 6 from the
bottom, the sentence “its formula (I* I + Pl.) + (I + Pl),
and      its

for generating   the electric currents.
   Thermo-electric currents are also, in some cases, of a pul
satory character; for, as several of the metals are constituted
of crystals, and those crystals of distinct elementary metallic
films (see my paper on the Thermo-magnetism of simple
metals, Phil. Mag. and Annals, vol. x.), the heat, which
in this case is the impelling agent, must necessarily arrive at
a certain degree of concentration, or of intensity, if you please,
in one film, or distinct metallic element, before it can possibly
take possession of the next. Consequently, however small and
inappreciable may be the interruption in each stage of                                                 its
progress, each interruption must necessarily produce         virtual                        a
pause; the very existence        which    ofthe advances      inheat                         of
from film   tofilm will constitute pulsatory progression.

 single ray has been incident externally in such a manner, that
 one of the refracted rays may coincide with the normal to the
 circular section of the surface of elasticity, or the optic axis".
     In the article alluded to, I have entered into an account of
 some experiments, undertaken at the request of Professor                                        Ha
 milton, which establish the existence of the first case of coni
 cal refraction; and go far, therefore, to support the theory of
 which it is a consequence.      I have only to add, on this part
 of the  subject,  that additional measurements, taken since that
 paper was written, indicate a nearer agreement between the
 observed and computed cones than was at first obtained.
     I have since succeeded in observing also the second species
 of conical refraction; and I now propose to give a brief sketch
 of the results of my experiments, referring for further detail
 to the forthcoming volume of the Transactions    -
                                                      of the Royal
 Irish  Academy.
    It has been already mentioned, that the existence of this
 phaenomenon depends upon the mathematical fact, —that the
 wave surface is touched in an infinite number of points, con
 stituting a small circle of contact, by a single plane parallel
 to one of the circular sections of the surface of elasticity.
 When a ray is incident upon the crystal externally, in such
 a direction that one refracted ray may be normal to the plane
just mentioned, it will be divided into a cone of rays within
the crystal, determined by lines connecting the centre of the
wave with the points of the periphery of the circle of contact.

                   in passing along the Aires of Biaral Crystals.                                                  209
     The light first employed,
                            was that of a lamp placed at some
distance; and in order to procure an incident ray as minute
as possible, this light was made to pass through two small
apertures; one of which was in a screen placed near the flame,
and the other perforated in a thin plate of metal close to the
first surface of the crystal. Observing the two rays into which
the incident ray is generally divided,        turned the crystal                      I
slowly, so as to alter the incidence very gradually.        After
some trials, in which                            I
                           was partly guided by the changes in
the relative position of these rays,      at length succeeded in               I
obtaining an ineidence at which the two rays were seen to
spread into a continuous circle; the diameter of which was a
parently equal to the interval between them when near #.
ultimate position.
   The emergent light in this instance was received directly
by the eye, assisted by a lens. On repeating the experiment
                                                 I
with the sun's light, was enabled to receive the emergent
cylinder upon a small screen of silver paper, and to see that
there was no sensible difference in the magnitude of the- sec-
tion at different distances from the crystal.
   When the adjustment was perfect, the light of the entire
annulus was white, and of equal intensity throughout.        But
on a  very  slight deviation from the exact   incidence, two op
posite quadrants of the circle appeared more faint than the two
others; and the two pairs were of complementary colours.
   The theoretical incidence is easily calculated. The ray
which proceeds within the crystal in the direction of the optic
axis being a normal to the wave-surface, the direction of the
corresponding incident ray will be given by the ordinary law
of the sines, assuming as the refractive index the mean index
of the crystal. The angle which the optic axis makes with
the axis of a, or with the perpendicular to the surface of                                                         in

and the voltaic fluid, unless it also be indefinitely contained
in the wire; and heat may be indefinitely continued by- fric

  To   put Dr. Hare's charcoal experiment to a test as nearly
parallel as the cases seem to admit,
   A card was placed between two copper plates, bound round
with wire, and set in the fire until the card was well charred.
It was then taken out and put between two plates of polished
copper, to each of which a wire was soldered; they were then
bound round tightly with many turns of waxed thread, and a
wooden wedge afterwards thrust under the thread, on each
side, so as to insure the charcoal being firmly and uniformly
pressed between the plates.        The two wires were then made
the connexion between a thermotest and a magnetest, one
connected with each pole of a large voltaic pair, weakly
charged.     Neither instrument was distinctly affected.
    A multiplier being substituted for the magnetest, the needle
deviated a few degrees.        A slip of bright copper was now
doubled so as to    pinch  the plates containing the charcoal, and
thus  complete   the metallic communication.       The needle was
set spinning, and the thermotest rose 10° an inch.
    The charge was now increased to about ºth of nitric acid,
 a smaller pair being employed (30); the charcoal and slip of
copper forming the communication alternately; and the mul
tiplier being again superseded by the magnetest.       The results
are  given in the  following  table.
    (The column headed “Mag.” is the deflection of the needle.

objections to the identity of voltaic and common electricity,
those objections do not seem to me sufficient, after the striking
experiment of Dr. Wollaston+, to establish any other distinc
tion between them than difference of tension; nor will any
other distinction be considered, in the following pages, between
the electrical and chemical effects of the pile. Tension is even
well known to expedite and facilitate the decomposition of water
and salts by the voltaic current.

   9. Professor Berzelius took 12 glasses, each 3 inches deep
and $ inch wide, half filled them with alkalescent muriate of
lime, the other half with dilute nitric acid.   Into each he
put a copper wire with a zinc foot, the zinc lying in the alka
lescent liquid, the copper bending over into the acid of the
succeeding glass. This formed what is commonly called the
circle of cups.                                            -
    So long as the poles were unconnected, the copper dissolved
in the acid, and the zinc remained unacted on ; but as soon as
the connexion was made (through solution of salt), the solu
 tion of copper ceased, and the zinc began to oxidate, the zinc
 becoming positive (in the liquid) and the copper negative, as
                                               -

    Here the chemical action, which was in full play on the
 copper, before the electrical circulation was opened, instead
 of directing that circulation, was checked, and even reversed
 bv it.          -
   yº simpler variation of this experiment will be described
 (14). And it will also be seen (18), that placing the zinc in
 an alkaline, the copper in an acid solution, is more efficacious
 than the contrary arrangement, although the acid acts much
 more freely on the zinc than on the copper.
    It is also generally known, that of neutral salts, none (ex
  cept sal-ammoniac) makes a more efficacious charge than sul
 phate of zinc, which is very unlikely to undergo decompo
sition.           -                                                              -

  The zinc was soon covered with gelatinous white oxide in
the alkali; and the copper in the acid gave off hydrogen gas
copiously, but without giving the slightest tinge to the liquor.
  The above table gives only about the average of many ex
periments, some of which differed considerably from the num

alkaline solution, of which more (21).
    15. If two glasses be filled with solution of common salt or
sulphate of zinc, and connected by a syphon of water; and a
pair of zinc and copper, connected through the multiplier, be
plunged one plate in each glass,—divergence of course ensues.
Now add some acid to the glass containing the zinc, no                                      in
crease takes place in the divergence.      Change the glasses so
that the  copper  shall be in the acidulated one, the divergence
is decidedly  increased.
    16. In both these cases (14, 15.) we have the zinc and cop
per in metallic connexion through the magnetest, and in
liquid communication through the same fluids; the only dif
ference being in the order of arrangements of the liquids.
    Hence the increased effect is not attributable to varied elec
trical relation between the metals; to different conducting
power in the liquid, still less to chemical action, that being
greatest when the zinc is in acid,-   where the voltaic action is
least.

mical effects. The zinc and silver were in good contact, and
so were the zinc and cloth; but the cloth communicated with
the silver only through the points of the tripod, a contact
with the liquid insufficient to convey a current capable of any
chemical action.
    His third pile was, zinc, tripod, cloth, silver; zinc, tripod,
wet cloth, &c.; and this produced no effects at all. The pile
was inert.    Yet (as noticed 16.) the communication here was
the same as in the previous experiment, except that the tripod
intercepted the contact of the zinc with the liquid, instead of
that of the silver. But the tripod was of brass, which is nega
tive to zinc, and was in contact with it on one side; whilst the
silver, also negative, was in contact with it on the other. And
De Luc attributes the inaction of this pile to the neutralizing
effect of the brass and silver on opposite sides of the zinc.

probable, would apply, the pair of plates described (14.) were

    But on soaking the paper in a strong alkaline solution (liquor
potassae), the rate was inverted, and the maximum effect pro
duced when the liquid was in full contact with the zinc.
    Alcohol produced, as might be expected, no effect whatever.
    In these experiments, the effect of the copper is weakened
by the liquid in contact with it being electro-positive (alkaline),
and destroyed by the interposition of a ring of positive metal
(zinc) between it and the liquid. And the effect of the zinc is
reduced by negative character in the liquid with which it is
in contact, or annulled by the interposition of a ring of nega
tive metal between it and the liquid.
    20. This similar effect of homo-electric metals and liquids,
and vice versä, in their contact with the voltaic plates, seems
 to offer a clue to the theory of the cases, (9, 13, 14, 15, 45,)
and of other unexplained phaenomena of the pile. If a nega
tive metal, placed between the zinc and the liquid, neutralizes
 the effect of the silver on the other side, has not a negative
property in the liquid itself a similar tendency?—modified and
impaired, of course, by the mobility and unsteadiness of liquid
particles.
     If it be so, when a negative liquid is in contact with the
 zinc of   a voltaic pair, the effect should be (except chemical
 action, 40.) the difference between the influence of the negative
 metal and the negative liquid.       On the other hand, when the
 negative liquid is in contact with the copper, the effect should
 be, the influence of the zinc, plus that of the negative liquid.
 And if we possessed a liquid of good conducting power, which
 should be electro-positive to zinc, the condition of that metal
 might be likewise exalted.        But here we are restrained by
 the   non-conducting    power   of oils, naphtha, alcohol and the
 like; and as water is negative to zinc, and alkaline solutions
 seem to lose in conducting power faster than they gain in
 electro-positive condition, a solution of neutral salt slightly alka
 lized seems to answer the best purpose with this metal: for—
     21. In experiment (14.) when the alkaline liquid contained
 a double quantity of potass, and was poured in nearly an inch
 deep, the effect was remarkably weakened, the deflection of

               therefore a real value of q corresponding to
any proposed real value of p may always be found so as to
make  Q = 0, and then we have R = P, a quantity always real.
   By assigning to p real values indefinite in number, the real
values of R thus obtained must either pass through zero, or
else some one result is nearer to zero than any other.

a value assigned to q that                 §

  But if we put for p, p + h {col}+ A/ — isin;} this
substitution will lead evidently to the same result as if we

  “At 4" 51* 36*5, sid. time, the comet was compared with a small
double star, whose approximate place for 1830.0 was found, by com
parison with 3 Aurigae, to be
                 AR 5h 40" 54°5; Decl. -- 36° 13' 31".
The stars composing this double star are about the 8th and 9th mag
nitudes ; their distance, roughly taken, about 65 parts of the micro
meter = 15"; and their angle of position 13° 20'sf= 103° 20'.
This description will enable any observer easily to identify and re
observe the double star in question. The comet, at the time above
stated, preceded the double star 38 seconds of time, and was found,
by a micrometric estimation (for I cannot call it a measure), to be
about 550 parts = 2' 12" North of                                   it.
    “On the next night, again observed the comet with the 20-feet

      September 25, and October 9, 1832–Colonel Sykes resumed the
   exhibition of the collection of Birds formed by him in Dukhun. On
  previous evenings he had brought under the notice of the Committee
  the Raptores and Insessores; and on the present he submitted the
  remaining orders in the form of a “Catalogue of Birds (systematically
  arranged) of the Rasorial, Grallatorial, and Natatorial Orders, ob
  served in the Dukhun by Lieut. Colonel W. H. Sykes, Bombay Army,
  F.L.S., F.Z.S., &c. &c." which is given in the “Proceedings" of the
  Committee.       In this catalogue are enumerated 95 species, making
  together with 137 enumerated in the former catalogue 232, among
  which 14 of those enumerated in the present catalogue are new to
  science. Of these new species the specific characters, dimensions,
  and localities are given, throughout ; together, in many instances,
  with observations on their habits, food, affinities, &c. Of the species
  already described by naturalists, specimens of which are contained in
  Colonel Sykes's collection, the synonymes and in some instances the
  native appellations are given; also references to figures, with remarks
  on their fidelity; in many cases the dimensions and the localities of
  the birds; and various remarks on their characters and habits, &c.
 We proceed to extract from Colonel Sykes's present Catalogue some
  articles which appear to possess peculiar interest.

 OBSERVATIONS                    ON TWO ARCHES      OF AURORAE BOREALES.—
                                       FROM R. POTTER, ESQ.
     observations I have to offer on these two appearances of the
THE
  aurora borealis, are not such as would be necessary for very ac
curate calculations of the height of the meteor; they will nevertheless
suffice for determining this height approximatively if contemporaneous
observations should chance to have been made in places properly situ
ated for the purpose. Indeed, if we adopt the hypothesis, as already
sufficiently demonstrated, that the arches are portions of luminous
rings round the magnetic axis, we may reduce the observations of
any two localities to a common magnetic meridian, when the arch has
not exhibited any deviation from a regular curvature.
   The last arch of those below having been nearly stationary for a
considerable length of time, I hope it may have been observed in
Scotland; and if Mr. Wharton of Dryburn near Durham shall have
seen     it,
          I  am sure       will       he

             apparent altitude with         instrument.  anThough this gen
tleman's observation, combined with mine, would not                  adequate,                        be

time after that I perceived the arch to have become double; by look
ing more frequently I found this appearance to arise from another
arch which was rising above the former, and which after attaining a
considerable altitude became irregular in form and disappeared, as
well as some other irregular appearances.        I noticed the first arch
during about an hour and a half, and though it was often very faint,
and had almost entirely disappeared, yet when it became bright again,
it always had very nearly the same altitude as at first: I, however,
sometimes believed it to be a little less if at all different.
   The next evening when I had arrived on the high ground of Stan
edge, between Huddersfield and Oldham, there was a promise of a
fine display, but the sky became immediately densely overcast, so that
no after-opportunity of observing occurred. The appearance on this
                                               I
occasion was different to any had before seen; the sky in the mag
netic north appeared thickly covered to a considerable height with
minute fleecy clouds of bright auroral light; this uncommon appear
ance made me regret having arrived within the influence of the cloudy
atmosphere of Lancashire.     I found that the evening of the 21st of
December had also been cloudy in the neighbourhood of Manchester.
                                       ANALYSIS OF GUMS.
   In our Number for September last, we gave the analyses of several
gums by M. Guerin; we now continue them.
   Cherry-tree Gum. Specific gravity 1.475, colourless or coloured
like gum arabic; it is in rounded pieces of various sizes, like those
of gum Senegal, or stalactitic. It frequently contains fragments of
wood in        interior; reddens litmus-paper, and has sometimes
               its                                                                                       an

acid taste. Heat, light and chlorine act upon         they     upon gumit      as          do
arabic; and the action                   of
                              alcohol, and    sulphuric and nitric acids,
                                                                 of
is also similar.   When pieces       this gum are put into cold water,
                                                   of
they swell and partially dissolve only, whatever may        the quantity                  be

              ;             by
                       boiling for some hours they dissolve perfectly.
According         Dr. Thomson, alcohol occasions
                      to                                 precipitation              no                   in
             gum, but M. Guerin asserts that precipitation always takes
  ace.
   One hundred parts cherry-tree gum heated with 400 parts    nitric                                of
acid, yielded 15:54 parts                 of

yielded the most. Water at 65° dissolved 10.91 per cent of sugar of
milk, and at 212°, 96.70 percent.; 100 parts of it heated with 600 parts
of nitric acid gave as a maximum product 28.62 of mucic acid, mixed
with oxalic acid; gum Senegal, which consists of arabin and water,
gave only 16.70 per cent. of mucic acid mixed with oxalic; but then
sugar of milk contains less than one per cent of water, while gum
Senegal contains 16.1 per cent. and 2.78 per cent. more of ashes.
   Mucic acid, obtained either from sugar of milk or gums, when dis
solved in boiling water, crystallizes on cooling in small scales, which
present on their edges small crystals, which appeared to be prisms
with a rectangular base.
                              SUPPOSED ARTIFICIAL                         MALIC ACID.
  M. Guerin observes that Scheele obtained a peculiar acid, which
he called Malic acid, by the action of nitric acid upon mucilage.
Fourcroy and Vauquelin repeated these experiments, and described
a new uncrystallizable acid, which they considered as identical with
the malic acid of fruits, this acid not having then been obtained in a
crystalline state.
   In order to prepare this artificial malic acid, M. Guerin employed
the following process: one part of gum arabic was treated with two
parts of nitric acid, diluted with half their weight of water; the mix
ture was heated moderately, until                              all
                                               the gum was dissolved, and the
solution was then slowly boiled for two hours. After dilution with
water      was neutralized with ammonia; mu<U+017F>riate

    oN THE CHEMICAL AGENCY                   of water.           By M. PELouzE.
    Anhydrous alcohol, sulphuric aether and acetic aether, disguise, more
or less completely, the properties of the strongest acids.       Their so
lution does not redden litmus, nor decompose a great number of car
bonates.       A mixture of about 6 parts of absolute alcohol and 1
part of concentrated sulphuric acid does not act upon any neutral
carbonate, but it immediately decomposes acetate of potash, and dis
engages abundant vapours of vinegar mixed with acetic aether.
    It is well known, since the labours of Hennell and Sérullas, that
sulphovinic acid is formed in the cold, in a mixture of alcohol and
concentrated sulphuric acid, but whatever may be the excess of alcohol
employed, free sulphuric acid remains in the mixture.       It is therefore
reasonable to conclude, from the above-mentioned experiment, that
an alcoholic solution of sulphovinic and sulphuric acid is incapable of
 decomposing a carbonate; water must be added that the action may
 occur.
    A solution of muriatic acid gas in alcohol, so concentrated that
 when diluted with several hundred times its volume of water it red
 dens litmus-paper, attacks artificial carbonate of lime and even marble
 itself with extreme violence. It also attacks, but less strongly, the
 carbonates of barytes, strontia, magnesia, and soda, even wheu they
 have been previously calcined; but on the contrary it does not de
compose carbonate of potash.         Concentrated nitric acid mixed with
alcohol does not decompose carbonate of potash; it acts emergetically
upon the carbonates of lime and strontia; those of barytes, magnesia,
and soda are also attacked, but much more slowly.
   Vegetable acids produce similar effects; the tartaric, paratartaric,
citric, and oxalic acids          all

  Means, &c.
   There have been very few meteorological peculiarities observed
during the year 1832. The annual mean of the barometer exceeds
in a trifling degree that of several years past.         The annual average
of the thermometer is less than that of 1831, but greater than the
mean of several preceding years. The cholera made                   appearance                        its

                                       was so fortunate as to obtain
my object on the first trial; for when the vibrations were
made to vary from 19:5 to 2°5, on each side of the point of
rest, they were equal to within less than half a second in
24 hours.
     Inext adjusted the suspending spring of the other clock,
which had a mercurial pendulum, and a suspending spring
nearly # of an inch in breadth, and Tlm of an inch in thick
mess.    A moveable clamp-piece was made to fasten near the
top of the pendulum rod, so as to be shifted up and down
at pleasure, and to clasp the suspending spring.             By various
trials     I
         found, that for this strength of spring and weight of
pendulum, the acting part required to be about gº of an inch
in length.
    After both clocks had been going for some time, I was sur
prised to find that each of them experienced a losing rate, but
particularly the shop time-piece with the light bob. Since
that period, which is about four years, I have had ample op
portunities of satisfying myself that this loss of rate originated
in the weakening of the spring.
    The clamping or fastening of the spring in the manner de
scribed, without any shortening of the absolute length of the
pendulum, occasioned the clock having the light pendulum to
gain about 3 minutes in 24 hours.             I therefore lowered the
pendulum bob, and brought it to time. About a month after
wards,         I
            found it losing on       rate, and screwedits        the pen               up
dulum bob.              now It   the distance
                                 is             (at  nearly  four years)    of
 screwed
                       up
                    about half

first;     circumstance which shows how much the spring has
           a
 weakened since that time. The clock frequently maintained                                              a
 uniform rate for three                   or
                               four weeks successively; after which
it  began       lose   to         on
                              rate, particularly when any sudden

                                          forming them thus:                    with          /

 These pallets were made separate, and being jointed upon their
 axes    ofmotion, the distance between them was regulated by

     of minute         Forces on the Rate          of the Seconds           Pendulum.           247
a tangent-screw, so that they could be adjusted to any depth
in the teeth of the wheel. This shape afforded the means of
giving about three fourths of the impulse in the descent. Ex
periment showed that the clock now gained about 2 seconds
in 24 hours. The extra friction in this case was in the ascent.
     It is known that if a pendulum have at the point of rest
impulse sufficient to reach 2°, with a certain quantity of fric
tion, it will require a greater impulse with a greater quantity
of friction. The greater impulse will of course cause the first
increments of motion to be quicker in the latter case than in
the former; but this incidental quickness will have gradually
decreased, and vanished when the pendulum has arrived at
the extent of 2°; and consequently, the entire vibration will
be quicker.        Pendulums having strong adjusted suspending
 springs require a maintaining power in weight about double
 of that which they would require with a thin spring, or on a
 knife-edge, in order to make them vibrate to the extent of 2°.
     The change of rate occasioned by the use of strong suspend
 ing springs, led to the consideration of some other practical
 means for obtaining isochronism, cycloidal cheeks being ad
 mitted to be objectionable in practice. It occurred to me that
 by placing a cylinder, or a portion of                      it,

pendulum rod, edgewise to the direction of motion of the pen
dulum.    The object in making it so light was, that the effect

 by transference of the acid into the alkali, and vice versä, until
 either neutralization has taken place, or the activity of the cir
 cuit is so far lowered as to have no longer power to commu

 hydrogen to the copper, in most cases; and we have seen (22)
 that not only this took place, but that the alkali continued to rise,
 and the acid to descend, in opposition to their specific gravity.

 augments the effect; but I do not find this happen unless the
additional copper be in immediate liquid communication with

vity of voltaic plates.
   29.     If
           this transference be the real conducting agency, it
should follow, that when the poles are disconnected, as the
electricity accumulates, and counterbalances those attractions
and repulsions between the plates, the action between them
should become gradually weaker, and at last cease, but be
renewed on restoring the connexion.     And such we know to
be the fact.
  Also, when the plates, and consequently the intermediate
imperfectly conducting strata of liquid, are multiplied, resist
ance to the passage of electricity is increased. It must there
fore accumulate, in degree, on each pair of plates; and the
atom of hydrogen from the zinc of pair A should be unable
to discharge itself into the copper of pair B, unless           charge                             its

 254     Mr. J. Prideaux               on the Theory                of Voltaic           Action.
      The number  75 is an estimate, and   think considerably be    I
 low the truth.    Becquerel's  table does not go so high.
    These facts do not appear so easy of explanation upon any
 other hypothesis of liquid conduction, as on that by trans
 ference of particles.
    31. As, however, we are unacquainted with any standard
 of the actual quantity of electricity circulating in any given
 voltaic action, and as it would be difficult to measure even
 the relative quantity that a given portion of positive and ne
 gative liquid matter can convey by transference of particles,
 under a given tension,--we cannot ascertain by calculation, any
 more than by direct experiment, whether this transference is
 likely to be the chief, or even a partial agent, in conveying
 the electricity through the liquid. The discharge of a Leyden
jar through a water-tube, though with great diminution of                                               its
impetus, yet exhibits,        rapidity a                       of
                                           conduction inconsistent
with our notions             of
                         the transference      particles; and     dis

tached to the plates will gradually drain off, and those remain
ing in the liquid may reassume the arrangement due to their
natural affinities. Thus the energy of action should be re
newed on replacing the plates in the liquid; and this renova
tion should have more or less permanence, according as the
re-establishment of the natural order of affinities were more
or less complete, and freed from remaining electrical influence.
And this, in an imperfectly conducting liquid, subject to the
 effects of combination and decomposition before noticed (28)
may be an operation not quite instantaneous.
    35.  If   such an electrical arrangement of molecules be the
 chief cause of decay of power in a battery (when the neu
 tralization of acid or alkaline charges is not concerned), then

 liquid (although kept beneath the surface of the water                      the           all

    As the plates occupied only the middle of the glass, and
 the backs were varnished, it was probable that but little of the
 charge, perhaps only the part immediately between the faces
 of the plates, had suffered electrical change. The needle was
 therefore allowed to recede to 28°, when the plates were lifted

258      Mr.    J. Prideaux on the                  Theory         of Voltaic Action.
When of two similar       plates, one is withdrawn from the action
of the    acid, the other remaining subject to           the latter will           it,
give off positive electricity       the liquor, which the former,
                                             to                                                                on
reentering, must take                  up
                                and convey back through the wire,
 as copper does.
    So   in   voltaic pair, when acid        brought      electrical at
                                                              is                    by
traction      or a
                otherwise into contact with zinc, the metal            at                                is
 tacked; the acid       water being decomposed
                            or                           the one hand,             on
and the zinc dissolved                on
                               the other. The positive electricity
passes from the zinc into the liquid (40)            the direction           in                                of
the galvanic current (and assuming the theory                 two elec                   of
tricities, the negative passes from the acid          the zinc, also          to                              in
the direction          of
                    the current).     Thus the chemical action com
pensates,       surpasses, the neutralizing effect
                or                                        the negative              of
liquid particles            on
                         the zinc,       proportion in        facility             to    its                  of
                                                                                              byits

                           the electrical character             residual                of
ingredients; whilst the copper          negatively excited
                                                    is           the acid

          Mr.   J.   Prideaux on the Theory of Voltaic Action.                               259
not recollect to have encountered elsewhere, is in point here,
and compares well with the stimulative action of the electric
state of the liquid (20).
     Ifa large and a small plate of zinc connected through a
multiplier be plunged into a weakly acid liquor, the larger acts
as copper; but increase the acidity, or warm the liquid, the
larger acts as zinc.
    Here when the acid is too weak to attack the zinc, the
larger surface giving the greater field for the influence of the
negative liquor, positive electricity sets away from it (20)
through the wire, to the smaller plate, as happens with cop
per. But when the metal is acted on, either by increasing the
acidity, or warming the liquor, the larger surface gives off the
more positive electricity to the liquor, which then sets through
the wire in the other direction, as in the case of zinc.; thus
not only compensating, but surpassing (42), the negative sti
mulation of the acid first demonstrated.
  It must here be confessed, that my results in repeating this
experiment have not been constant, though generally confir
matory. The authority of Berzelius                         is,

   When discharged of their acquired electricity, they remain
 attached to the anti-electric plates, and thus assume the coun
 teracting character above mentioned, obstructing the current
in proportion to the quantity collected on the surface of the
plates (32). But when there is free acid, it no sooner comes
in contact with the zinc, than it begins to act upon        and the                                    it,

they will form by their union a single wave of double force.
Now light is supposed to consist of the undulations of an ima
ginary elastic aether, as sound consists of undulations of the air.
  If   therefore we suppose a ray entering into a darkened
chamber through a small orifice at A (see the following figure)
to proceed forward in a direct line to Y, when it falls on a
sheet of white paper; while another ray proceeding in the
direction AK, is inflected at K by touching the edge of a
knife, or other solid body, and turned into the direction KY,
so as to fall on the same point Y as the former ray;—then the
effect produced by the joint action of these two rays will be
different, accordingly as the lengths of their paths differ or not
by an integral number of undulations. If the lengths of their
paths differ by a half-undulation, or any odd number of half
undulations, they will destroy one another, and the spot Y will
be dark.    Jf the lengths of their paths differ by a whole un
dulation, or any number of whole undulations, they will coin
cide, and the spot Y will be of double brightness.       And thus
are explained the alternate bands of light and shade, which
border the shadows of bodies placed in a small beam of light

    The lengths of the two rays AY, AKY, are always com
 puted by Young and Fresnel from the point A, which they
denominate the “origin of the rays:” or the “luminous point.”
 But it appears to me that the true origin of the rays is at two
points R, R', on the surface of the sun; and that instead of
 comparing AY with AKY, we ought to compare R/Y with
 RKY. Now that this comparison should give the same re
 sults as the former,-in other words, that the line RA should
 either be equal to RA, or that their lengths should always
 differ precisely by an integral number of undulations,—is evi
 dently impossible.
    It will not be said, presume, that the two rays RA, RA,

on entering through the small opening at A, exercise any
mutual action on each other, so as to become in fact a single
ray. Such a suggestion would be at variance with the whole.

   Thirdly. The theory of Fresnel is quite irreconcileable with
another observation of Newton's, which I have frequently
verified. When the interval between the two knife-blades is
very much diminished, the spectrum thrown on the paper ex
hibits a dark space in  centre.          its
                                  “When the distance      the                                           of
edges was about the four hundredth part          inch,” says                       of   an
Newton, “the stream      light parted    of
                                        the middle, and left            in
a shadow between the two   parts.  This shadow was     black                                      so
 and dark that         the light which passed between the knives
                         all
 seemed        to
              be bent,   and turned aside          the one hand      to                                 or   to
 the other. And          the knives still approached one another,
                              as
 the shadow grew broader, and the streams shorter             their                          at              in
 ward ends which were next the shadow, until upon the con
 tact     the knives the whole light vanished, leaving
          of                                                     place                            its
 to the shadow”.
    The most satisfactory way            performing this experiment
                                                       of
is
to     employ two razor-blades, whose edges are slightly con
vex; for then the coloured bands will be seen
running round the dark space                either side,   on
as   inthe annexed    figure.     The  position       the                    of
dark space, and                of
                          the greatest divergence                                  of
the coloured bands, answers              course       of
                                                      the                  to

    It will be seen that the intensity of the light is a maximum
 at the centre of the spectrum; or when r, the distance from
 that centre, is equal to 0.
    I have supposed a = 30 inches, and b = 21 inches, simply
because these appear to have been about the distances of the
knives, from the window-shutter and from the paper respec
tively, in Newton's observation.             But if any other values are
assigned to these       latter,   provided    the interval between the
two blades is very small, the same conclusion will be found to
                                -
hold good.
    I might refer to other phaenomena, which appear to me no
less irreconcileable with the undulatory hypothesis than those
here considered. But this seems unnecessary; for if the pre
ceding reasonings and computations involve no error, they are
 surely of themselves sufficient to overthrow that hypothesis.

 sures; in twenty hours, 34 measures; in twenty-nine hours,
41 measures; in thirty-eight hours, the expansion was at a
maximum, namely, 43 measures.          In explanation of the long
duration of this and the following experiments, it may be
stated, that the plug was fully half an inch in thickness.
   795 measures oxygen and vapour have therefore been re
placed by 838 measures air and vapour.
   795
   838   =  0-9487 = diffusion-volume of oxygen    by experiment.
   This is the exact theoretic number; a coincidence, however,
which we must view as accidental.
   Exp. 2.-In a careful repetition of this experiment with
another specimen of oxygen gas, the results approached very
closely to the preceding; but the return-air was in slight ex
cess above the theoretical quantity.     Thus,

   836 measures contracted 3 measures in two hours and forty
minutes, as corrected by standard; and 13 measures in eigh

the last as the true result,

receiver, allowed to stand over water for twenty-four hours,
and finally washed with caustic ley.

   The contraction in this experiment is a little above the
theoretical quantity. In another experiment with different
gas, the contraction was even greater, indicating a diffusion
volume = 1.0303; but the presence of a minute quantity of
carburetted hydrogen, or some lighter hydro-carburet, was
suspected, from the rapidity of the contraction in this case.

long occupied, but which I have not yet been able to get

considered sufficiently homogeneous for experiments where
much greater delicacy was required.           I also inclined the two
mirrors so much to each other as to render the bands suffi

little distance from the prism, into a po
sition similar to c d, I had no danger
of falling into Prof. Airy's error of sup
posing the change to arise only from
the shifting of the centre of the fringes,

quiries.   Amongst the objections not generally raised, which
OCCur to me at <U+017F>he moment, I may mention, that the heating
properties of one end of the solar spectrum and the chemical
effects produced at the other, seem very inadequately ac
counted for to a chemist, by a small difference in the lengths
of the undulations. The whole connexion of light, heat, and
electricity seems to him beset with extraordinary difficulties,
by adopting the undulatory theory of light. The subject of
the combined or latent caloric of bodies, and the circumstance
of transparent solid bodies belonging entirely to the class of
electrics, give him a presentiment that we must look to more
varied and profound causes than the motion of a subtile aether
for the explanation of the effects we witness.       (I must here
notice that I cannot, with many opticians, call the translucency
of thin metallic leaves transparency.) The phaenomena of the
absorption of light by coloured media have justly been shown
by Sir David Brewster to militate strongly against this theory.
   y own discovery of the law of reflection by metals offers also
a strong objection; for that whilst a considerable portion of
the light enters the substance of the metal as in transparent
bodies, yet the law of the variation of the intensity of the re
flection is essentially different. The chemical theory would
remind us that both classes of bodies possess determinate
specific heats, but that there is an essential difference in their
electrical properties, the former being conductors, and the
latter electrics. I hence learn to look beyond the results of a
mechanical theory on the motions excited in a subtile aether,
for the solution. The effects of chemical agency and of ar
rangement of atoms in crystallized bodies show also the con
nexion of the optical effects with chemical affinities, and which
brings us again to the theory of chemical combinations, with
out which, it appears to me, we can never give a satisfactory
reason for double refraction, which is so intimately connected
with the polarized condition of light.
    The failing of the deductions of the most talented men who
have adopted the undulatory theory, of which many instances
have fallen under my own observation, and several of which
I  have already published, give me also more than a distrust
of the fundamental hypothesis having any basis in nature.
    With respect to the claim of half an undulation, my manner
of speaking of which appears unpleasant to Professor Airy,       I
must say, that, although we do not find any mention of it
under this title in his undulatory theory of optics in the last
edition of his mathematical tracts, yet he is no doubt aware
that when he says “he must have derived it from some very
imperfect or erroneous statement,”       I   had in recollection

Dr. Young's        article “Chromatics” in the Supplement to the
Encyclopædia Britannica.                Dr. Young there gives as follows:
“In reflections at the surface of a rarer medium, and of some
metals, in         all

in considering  the  irregularity arising in pencils of only a few
minutes of a  degree   in breadth from aberrations to be correctly
negligible.

Hues 45 and 55 inches, we have

where, taking the numbers of my former paper, we have
                        m    = -00414834

and               -        l = 44-35 nearly.
Hence for r = 45        inches...... y = 000000382
and       a = 55              ...... y = -000003651
and the difference of these is .000003319, or rather more than
three millionths of an inch.
   This difference is so small, that I am sure Professor Hamil
ton would never have given me credit for being so minutely
acute an observer, if he had had recourse to actual quantities.
It is also easy to determine, that in the experiment the ordi
mate y is not zero at the prism, as the formula indicates it
should be. Without having an accurate measurement, I ne
vertheless know that the effect under consideration, from what
ever cause it arises, is at least several thousand times the amount
of the above calculated difference.                                    -
    Whatever velocity be finally ascertained to belong to light
in passing through refracting bodies, it is clear that a different
view in the theory of emission must be taken from the New
tonian one of refraction.          I
                                 recollect, a long time ago, hearing
Dr. Dalton express his opinion in private conversation, that
it was not the same light which impinged upon the first sur
face of transparent bodies that left the second surface.          It is
clear that this view would bring refraction to a similar consi
deration with that of undulations. I have frequently considered
the consequences which this view would lead                        to,
                                                            and must
confess that  I   donot still see        it        be
                                            entirely

difficulties, though these might most probably vanish                       on
further study; and have
                      I            no

XLVII.       On the undulatory Time of Passage of Light through
     a Prism. By WILLIAM R. HAMILTON, Esq. Andrews' Pro
    fessor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin, and Royal
     Astronomer of Ireland *.
SINCE    I communicated              my little paper, On the Effect of
   Aberration in prismatic           Interference, (p. 191.) I have seen
Professor Airy's remarks on Mr. Potter's experiment; in which
it is suggested, that the observed central points, which tended
towards the thickness of the prism, were not the points of                                             si
multaneous arrival of two homogeneous streams.                      From the
well-known experience and skill of Professor Airy as an ob
         I
server, think it likely that he has assigned the true physical
explanation of Mr. Potter's instructive experiment; though
I  wish that this experiment were repeated, with careful micro
metrical measures.          But              I
                                      continue to think the mathema
tical correction      just,  which                I
                                        proposed in my recent paper.
                        I
In that paper, took Mr. Potter's own account of his experi
ment; namely, that he had found, in the plane perpendicular
to the edge, a tendency towards the thickness, and from a cer
tain intermedial line, in the locus of the points of simultaneous
arrival of two near homogeneous streams: and endeavoured                            I
to show, that according to the undulatory theory, this locus
ought, during a considerable range, to tend in this direction
 and not in the opposite;—a mathematical result, which was
 contrary to Mr. Potter's conclusion.              It                    is,
                                                             hope, unneces I

restrial magnetism in a given place, viz. Declination, Inclination, and
Intensity, the first soonest engaged the attention of philosophers, the
second much later, and the third has only at a very recent period
become an object of investigation and experiment. This progressive
interest is chiefly to be accounted for by the circumstance, that while
the variation of the compass offered the greatest interest, as applied
to the purposes of navigation and geodesic operations, the dip was
looked upon as more nearly allied to it than was the intensity of ter
restrial magnetism. To the natural philosopher, those three elements
are absolutely of the same import, inasmuch as our knowledge of the
general system of terrestrial magnetism will ever remain imperfect,

computation unless we know the law of the force exerted on each
other by two elements of free magnetism, or, in other words, with
which, according as they are of the same or different denominations,
they repel or attract each other.      Tobias Mayer had already conjec
tured this law to be the same with that of general gravitation, i.e. that
the force is in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance. Coulomb
and Hansteen have endeavoured experimentally to confirm this conjec
ture; and the fact is now completely established by the experiments
detailed in Professor Gauss's forthcoming memoir. This law, however,
only relates to the elementary effect; for the computation of the total
effect of a magnetic body on another, as soon as the nature of the
distribution of free magnetism in these bodies is accurately known,
becomes a problem purely mathematical, and consequently remains
dependent on their casual individual nature; but the greater the
distance, the less the influence of this individuality becomes; and if
the distance be very great, we may, catteris paribus, assume (as indeed
follows from the above principle,) the total effect to be inversely pro
portional to the cube of the distance. The product of this cube into
the fraction which expresses the ratio of the effect of the first needle,
and of the terrestrial magnetism on the second needle, will therefore,
as the distances continually increase, tend to a determined limit.      A
proper combination of observations at several judiciously selected
distances will, being mathematically treated, make us acquainted with
that limit, from which may be deduced the ratio of those two quan
tities the product of which was derived from the observed times of
vibration. The combination of both results will then obviously give
those two quantities themselves.
    The experiments for comparing the effects of the magnetism of the
earth, and of the first needle on the second, suspended by a thread,
may be conducted in two different ways; inasmuch as the latter may
be observed either in a state of motion or of rest. The former is best
effected by placing the first needle in the magnetic meridian of the
second, whereby the time of a vibration of the latter is either increased
or diminished, according as poles of the same or of different names
are opposed to each other.      The comparison of the time of vibration
thus   changed,  with that occasioned by terrestrial magnetism alone,
or  rather, the comparison  of an increased with a diminished one (under
opposite directions of the first needle), will then readily lead to the
ratio sought. The second mode is that of placing the first needle in such
a manner that the direction of its influence on the second makes an
angle with the magnetic terrestrial meridian; when the angle of de
viation from the meridian, in a state of equilibrium, will equally lead to
the knowledge of the ratio sought. And here, too, it is more advan
tageous to compare with each other two opposite deviations, under op
posite positions of the first needle.    The most advantageous position
of this needle is along a straight line drawn through the middle of the
second and perpendicular to the magnetic meridian. The first mode
agrees upon the whole with that proposed some years ago by Poisson;

some natural philosophers with a view to apply that mode, have either
entirely failed, or their results can at best be considered only as im
perfect approximations.
    Professor Gauss, who has made frequent trials of both those modes
of proceeding, is satisfied that the second                     many accounts,   is,     on                                  far

 lowed almost from one minute of time to the other.
    Of equal importance is this mode of proceeding for observing the
 duration of the vibrations. The passage of the vertical thread in the
telescope before a fixed point of the scale (properly speaking, the re
 verse is the case), may, even if the whole deviation only amount to
 a few minutes, be observed with such a degree of precision as never to
leave any uncertainty amounting to the tenth of a second in time. The
considerable duration of a vibration (about 14 seconds in the most in
tensely magnetized needles), and the slow degrees by which the are
 decreases, are productive of other important advantages: only a few
 vibrations are required to enable us to determine the time of one vi
 bration with such accuracy, that, though the needle be left to itself
for one or even several hours, no doubt will remain on the mind of
 the observer as to the number of oscillations performed during the
 interval of his absence.    We may commence with vibrations so small
 (such, for instance, as those with which we generally leave off,) that
 the reduction to infinitely small vibrations becomes almost impercep
 tible; and yet, after an interval of six and more hours, the vibrations
 are still found sufficiently great to admit of having their beginnings
 observed with         all

are the most sensible and convenient galvanometers both for the

the strongest, it is only required to bring the conducting wire single,

   Dec. 19, 1832.-A paper was read, entitled “Report of a Survey
of the Oolitic Formations of Gloucestershire.”          By William Lons
dale, F.G.S.
   This survey was made in consequence of a resolution of the Coun
cil, confirmed by the Annual General Meeting of 1832, that one
year's dividends of the Wollaston Fund should be applied to the
continuing, northwards from Bath, the survey of the oolitic formations
commenced by the author of the Report in the year 1827.
   The district examined is bounded on the west by the escarpment
of the oolitic hills from Toghill, 4% miles N.W. of Bath, to Medn
Hill, near Chipping Campden ; and on the east by the foot of the
coral-rag-hills, from the neighbourhood of Chippenham to Farring
don, and thence by a straight line passing from Burford to Stow-on
the-Wold and Shipston-on-Stour. The formations examined are the
marlstone, inferior oolite, Fuller's earth, great oolite, forest marble,
and cornbrash.
   The geologists to whose labours the author acknowledges himself
much indebted, are, Mr. Smith, Mr. Cumberland, Mr. Weaver, the
Rev. William Conybeare, Mr. De la Beche, Mr. Murchison, and
Mr. Greenough : he also notices the great advantage which he pos
sessed in having the Ordnance Maps for the base of his survey.

    The author states that he was indebted to Mr. Greenough for the
first suggestion that the slate of Gloucestershire would prove to be
the equivalent of the slate of Stonesfield.
    The author, in alluding to the fossils of the great oolite, remarks
on the important changes which are effected by removing the Stones
field slate from the forest marble to the bottom of the great oolite.
    Forest marble.—The Bradford clay, which separates the great oolite
from the forest marble in Wiltshire, was observed only in the most
southern part of Gloucestershire. Of the forest marble itself, the
survey afforded no new characters.             It was found to consist of a thick
stratum of laminated shelly oolite, interposed between beds of sandy
clay, containing laminae of grit; and to have, from Bath to near
Fairford, for           its
                      uppermost stratum,          deposit     loose sand, contain

   February 19, 1833.—A paper was read, entitled, “Observations on
a new Genus of the Order Musci.” By William Valentine, Esq. F.L.S.
   This genus is founded on the Phascum Stoloniferum of Dickson;
and the principal characters are,        lateral fructification, and the pre

Mr. Griffith could not find any vascular connexion between the fila
ments and the perianthium                     :        he
                                       thinks the adhesion takes place                                                by
means      of loose cellular tissue.      Mr. Griffith remarks, that the stem
in   this plant deviates from the dicotyledonous structure, the centre
being composed           cellular tissue, with bundles
                              of                               woody fibre inter         of

  nations previous to the present. Newton, from observations of the
  fourth satellite made by Pound, determined the mass to be rºry of
  the Sun's mass; Laplace, from the same observations, found nearly
  the same value; and Bouvard obtained nearly the same from the
  perturbations of Saturn; Nicolai, from the perturbations of Juno,
  found ro-Hr ºr (a value generally adopted by the German astrono
  mers); Encke, in examining whether the absolute attraction of                                            Ju
  piter on the Sun and on Vesta were the same, found Tri-n-r, re
 marking at the same time that Nicolai's value would satisfy his
 observations nearly as well.        Professor Airy's observations were
  made on the     elongation  of the fourth satellite in right ascension.
  Thirteen sets of observations were made, in each of which the planet
 and satellite were observed upon twenty-four or thirty-six wires.
 The first set was never calculated. The second and third were
 rejected, because the axis of the declination circle of the equatorial
 employed in these observations, was not strictly perpendicular to the
 polar axis (all the other adjustments being tolerably exact). It ap
fº.       in the sequel, that in these two observations the instrument
   ad been in opposite positions, and the mean of the determinations
 might therefore have been retained.        The effect of such a want of
 adjustment was guarded against in the other observations, by re
 versing the instrument in the middle of the series.       For calculation
 of the mass, the place of the satellite was computed from Laplace's
 theory, leaving only the mean distance indeterminate. In the course
 of these calculations, some remarkable numerical errors were disco
vered in the Mécanique Céleste: in particular the mean longitude of
the satellite is in error by nearly one third of the circumference. On
comparing the different results, it appeared that         the observations     a all
in  which the satellite followed the planet indicated greater mass than
those     to in
           which     preceded the planet; this

dark part was opake.          Shortly after (probably between 8" 35m and
8"40" Cambridge mean time) it was noticed that the bright edge
began to divide into streamers, and that stars were visible through
the dark as well as through the bright part. At this time the upper
edge of the bright band, or the upper extremities of the streamers,
reached very little above Polaris, and perhaps two degrees above
Venus. The length of the streamers did not at the utmost exceed
six or seven degrees.        A bright spot formed itself below Venus, and
continued in that situation almost permanently during the whole ap
pearance. The streamers, when first formed, were curved, with their
convexity towards the west: afterwards they were straight, and their
direction nearly perpendicular to the band (perhaps deviating from
this direction towards the direction of a vertical).                While watching
the streamers east of       Polaris,   a shooting   star was seen above them ;
the direction of       itspath    coincided with the interval between two
streamers produced, but we were not certain whether                      approached             it
to them or receded from them. The lateral motion of the streamers
 was very remarkable.         Some        them remained stationary (changing

     CAMBRIDGE MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.
   The meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science for this year is to be held at Cambridge; to commence on
the 24th of June, and end on the following Friday.     A notice re
specting the arrangements for visitors, and inviting the attendance
and communications of men of science, has been issued by the Cam
bridge Secretaries, Professor Henslow and the Rev. W. Whewell.
All who are aware of the gratification, and the advantage to science,
with which the former meetings have been attended, must, we are
persuaded, feel a wish to be present.      A full Report of the Pro
ceedings of those meetings is nearly ready for publication, con

322       Mr.J.   S. Enys's Remarks on the Granite found
of the granite, varying in size from 10 to 500 tons, or loose
rocks of equal size; many of these last, however, are pro
bably in their original position, if any judgement can be form
ed from the coincidence both of the remains of the natural
joints and of the “cleaving line,” with the quarry masses: such
 seems the case with the Main Rock or Tolmen, a remarkable
 and well-known rock, situated near the centre of the hard
 granite line; it is supported on several large rocks by two
 points, and measures about 500 tons.
    Granite is always measured, and 14 cubic feet are allowed
 to a ton; though 13% of fine grit will generally amount to
 that weight.
     Cleaving is used to express splitting up a rock into blocks
 for sale.
     The joints both of the hard and softer granite are very simi
 lar, but are more frequent and numerous in the latter variety.
 They have a strong tendency to meet at right angles, so as to
 form masses or rocks of a rectangular shape; these are often
 50 feet long, and from 10 to 25 feet deep, and seem exactly
 similar to those at the Land's End and Cape Cornwall, and to
 the Logan Rock.
     A small quantity of a softer stone is occasionally found be
 tween some of the joints, which is not observed to be present
 in exposed headlands. The Arris is likewise square, but on
 rocks long exposed to the influence of the weather it seems
 to have been rounded. The rectangular form, however, is as
 strongly marked as in the quarry, the joints of which are ge
 nerally visible, though the granite seems in most instances to
 be in actual contact. Occasionally a rock has been split within
 two inches of a joint, which has only been found by the break
 ing of the blocks in working.       One of these joints is nearly
  horizontal, and is called the Bed-way or Floor, and two are
  nearly perpendicular, one of which is found generally to run in
  a direction N.N.W. and S.S.E. with a variation of 15 or 20
  degrees either way; the third being across.      In some quarries
  this  arrangement   is extremely  regular, though  in others many
  of the   joints are “unconformable.”      Fortunately,   blocks for
  buildings are mostly required of rectangular forms, so that
  rocks are often split up to great advantage.
     To form a cubic block, it is evident three ways of cleaving
  are required: these are termed by the cleavers or stone-cutters,

   This, as far as one trial can do so, more than proves the
stone-cutter's assertion;–the cleaver likewise added that the
tough way was struck rather harder than the other. The
cleaving can be effected on any diagonal line, but the fracture
is untrue; it is almost invariably true both on the capping
and cleaving lines, though less on the tough way.
    In cleaving granite two varieties of gear are in use, Wedges
and Cues,—the latter so called from the ox-shoes, which were
first used for the purpose; and Rippers and Feathers. The
ripper is sometimes called a Tearer; it is only a tapered bar of
iron, in fact a circular wedge; it is used in deep holes formed
by a borer or jumper; the last is well known in quarries, the
former is beat by a man with a sledge-hammer, and turned in
the hole by a boy who holds           The wedge placed

THE   unshaded part is intended to show the direction of
  the range of hard or compact granite near Penryn, which
is nearly N.E. and S.W.              Its length about 5 or 6 miles, and
its  breadth       1   to      14
                           mile.
    The dotted part represents             coarser granite, less compact,
                                                       a

    The granitic district extends many miles towards the north
west, and includes,          there  as    reason     isbelieve, other ranges
                                                                        to

        I
      apprehend that granitic ranges occur in various parts of
 Europe possessing identical characters, as far at least as the
joints are concerned, respecting which it seems desirable to
 obtain specific information bearing on the points in question;
 for I think it must be evident, that wherever a conformity in
 the cleavage, or indeed in the joints of different ranges of
 granite can be established, especially where such ranges are
 found in contact, there is good reason to consider them con
 temporaneous, however differently they appear to be circum
 stanced in other respects.                       R. W. Fox.

   Unfortunately the wire could not be displaced more than
 15', at which angle (of depression) the reflected disc appeared
so foggy, indistinct, and even elliptical, that—instead of ob
serving the lower or upper limb (or both), -the vertical dia
meter, which appeared under an angle of not less than two
minutes, was bisected, vaguely no doubt, but as exactly as
could be estimated.     No reference level was made use of, al
though clearly proved in a succeeding attempt to be absolutely
indispensable. So many sources of inaccuracy led, as might
be anticipated, to most unsatisfactory results; the error coming
out, not the same by both levels, as should have been the case,
but 30" by the one, and 38" by the other. An extra horizon
tal wire, fixed just within the limits of the stop, would insure
complete success to this novel method”.

measured in succession, first on one arc, and, immediately
after inverting the cylinder, also on the other. The reversing
points of the levels were well ascertained; the stand of the
sector being previously glued to the plank, which was kept at
one constant inclination by referring to Fortin's level. The
measurements, of which the details follow, give on an average

332            Mr.        J. Nixon      on the Measurement                 of the
inner surface BS of the bar must be elevated by the arc BA
before the bubble of the level attached to it can attain its mark.
This arc being in defect of double the elevation of ES (or arc
A/A) by the arc BA, equal to the angle formed by the sur
faces of the bar, whilst the previous measurement exceeded it by
the same quantity, half their sum will be the correct elevation.
   The elevation of a distant object, measured on this plan by
a 30-inch telescope carrying a divided arch (of 18 inches ra
dius), of which the moveable index was furnished with a double
level, exceeded by 30"5 the angle obtained by the correspond
ing observation with the sector.
   When a double level is affixed to the face of a divided cir
cle, move the latter until the bubble of the level uppermost
settles with       extremities equidistant from the zero
                    its                                                                            of   its
scale; then turn the circle exactly half round, and alter the
adjustments        of
                 the other level                  (at
                                      present uppermost) until the

LV. An      Account         of Test Objects for Microscopes.                 By ANDREw
                                  PRITCHARD,            Esq.”.

          important advance in our knowledge of those
EVERY
  bodies in the material universe, from which our earth ap
pears as an atom, has been coeval with, and greatly dependent
upon, some augmentation of the powers and effectiveness of
telescopes.      Before the discovery of the double stars and ne
bulae, the goodness of these instruments was determined by
their capability of showing the planets and their satellites.
But, since our acquaintance with the former bodies, telescopes
have to undergo more severe tests, and greater accuracy in
their construction is required.       What has been advanced in
regard to the telescope will be found applicable to the mi
croscope; and to the discovery of certain objects which may
be considered as tests of the penetrating and defining powers
of this instrument, we may justly attribute the grand and mag
nificent improvements which the microscope has recently re
ceived.
    In the perusal of the works of Leeuwenhoek, Dr. Goring
met with a passage describing the dust, or imbricated scales,
which cover the wings of the silkworm (Phalena Mori), from
which he was led to suspect there were some peculiar pro
perties in the lines on the feathers and scales of insects, ren
dering them more difficult to be discerned than other micro
scopic objects; and the result of his investigation was the dis
covery of their properties as tests—a description of object be
fore unknown in the annals of microscopic science.
     Now, as it is undoubtedly of the highest importance to the
naturalist that he should know the exact capabilities of his
instrument, in order that he may not be led astray in his in
 vestigations, by placing undue confidence in           and    these

 bited with the greatest perspicuity.          In this investigation, it
was found that there were two distinct properties in a micro
scope, and that the instrument might possess a very consider
able approximation to perfection in the one, and fall short in
the other, or vice versä, or might be perfect in both. The
lines on the dust or feathers from the wings of the lepidoptera,
and those on the scales from the body and limbs of the thysa
nuraeous insects, offered the means of determining their good
ness in one particular, viz. their penetration, and the structure
of the hair of animals, certain mosses, &c. served to ascertain
 their defining power.
    The analogy between telescopes and microscopes is so great,
that    Icannot be said to digress from my subject by stating
that the aforesaid observations apply also to the former of these
                                                                          #.
instruments, which seldom coinbines the two qualities of pene
tration and definition to any great extent.                 a telescope
with a large aperture will frequently resolve clusters of stars,
and exhibit nebulae, while it will fail in defining the disc of a
planet, or the moon, with precision; and, on the other hand,
one of moderate aperture accurately figured will define the
latter, but be wholly inert on the nebulae and clusters.            So a
microscope with large aperture and high power will show the
“active molecules” and lined objects, while it will not define
a leaf of moss, or a mouse hair; and another with a smaller
aperture will define the latter, but prove ineffective on the
former. This is very manifest in single lenses which require
different apertures for different objects”.
    The penetration of a microscope has been shown to be de
pendent on              its
                    angle                of
                              aperture, and that whenever this was
less than      certain  quantity,  the lined structure       the scales             of
               be a

may be; and the defining power            inversely     the quantity
                                                          is                  as                  of

first division, as artificial stars, enamel dial-plate, wire gauze,
&c.", which inform us of the state of their aberration, achro
matism, centering, adjustment, curves, &c., shall pass over,I
as many persons are not disposed to enter        into a scientific
scrutiny concerning the causes of their demerits, and because
they are more applicable to engiscopes, or compound micro
scopes, than to single and compound magnifiers,          and shall
content myself by giving some simple means of determining
effectiveness by means of the second division.
   (1.) Lepisma saccharina.-The insects of the families Le
pismenae and Podurellae are comprehended in the order Thy
sanoura of Cuvier and Latreille; they are small, frequenting
damp places, and are of various colours; they leap like fleas.
   The scales of these apterous insects must be taken from fresh
specimens, for, when long dead, they adhere so firmly to the
insect, that they cannot be detached without injury.
   Their longitudinal lines slightly radiate from the point of
insertion; they are readily seen, and appear flat or square,
like the indentations on some bivalve shells: these are the
prettiest scales I am acquainted with. There are other lines
in various directions, as shown in the drawing of a magnified
scale at fig. 1. Plate       III.
                               When the candle is so placed as
to bring out the latter strongest, and the scale is turned round
in the axis of the microscope in certain positions, they will
cease to appear connected.      In this object it is the sharpness
and cleanness of the   spaces that chiefly evince the goodness of
a microscope, for the longitudinal lines are easily developed.
   (2.) The Morpho Menelaus-This butterfly is indigenous
to America, the wings are indented, and their superior surface
of a highly-polished blue colour.
   The imbricated scales from the centre of the superior side
of the wing are of a pale blue, mixt with others almost black.
 The former are mostly broader than the latter, and are the test
objects required; they measure about one one-hundred and
twentieth of an inch in length. When viewed in a microscope,
they exhibit a series of longitudinal stripes or lines, as shown
 in the magnified drawing, fig. 2. Plate                   III.
                                                    Between these
lines are disposed cross striae, which, with the lines, give it
the appearance of brick-work.
    The microscope or engiscope under examination should
 be able to make out these markings, with the spaces between
 them, clean and distinct. The cross striae, which give the

short, broad, and more opake.             There are also found, on the
same    wing,   two or three other     sorts,  but they are unworthy of
notice as    proof  objects.
    In Plate      III.at fig. 4*. is represented a sample of the re
gular proof feather.            It
                               is very transparent, and has a yellowish
tint; the surface is seldom smooth, as indicated at the part a.
In the engiscope these inequalities are not so observable, and
therefore, when the lines appear strong, the surface is more
uniform than in the microscope. This object requires the
light more oblique than any other of the lined kind. On this
account      Ihave seldom been able to see the lines satisfactorily
with Dr. Wollaston's illumination, unless the magnifier was
much out of the axis of the perforation. If we throw the light
of a candle (placed a few inches behind the stage) obliquely
on them, they can be seen very sharp.                             I
                                                       have seen them in
this way with a simple jewel lens, of only one fifteenth of an
inch focus.
    (7.) The Podura plumbea.—(Lead-coloured Spring-tail.)—
The body and limbs of these insects are covered with scales,
which, from their extreme delicacy, require great care in re
moving.       They are also very soft, and easily wounded. The
fluid which exudes from the injury so completely adheres to
the scales as to obliterate                  all
                                         their markings,       Hence they
 must   be   cautiously handled. Those who are desirous                 pre               of

especially the French ones, are very easy, and unworthy the
title of proofs; and, as they might be substituted for those                                    I
am describing, and thus a common instrument might pass for
one of superior excellence,                             I
                                  feel justified in giving this cau
tion *.
    The size of these scales varies from one nine hundredth to
one hundred and sixtieth of an inch in length, and, as they
decrease in size, become more transparent.         They are of dif
ferent forms, but possess a general character, easily recognised,
by the want of any sharp angles.          Under a microscope not
having sufficient penetration, the tissue appears devoid of
structure or markings; but, when placed in a superior one,
and the illumination properly made, they show a series of
lines or cords on their surface, and present a much greater
variety in their arrangement than the scales of any other
species of insect.     Some have the lines straight, as shown in
the magnified scales, Plate                             III.
                                      fig. 5. and 6, and have two
 sets of oblique  lines on  them,  similar to fig. 8+; others are
waved and      curved,  as shown in fig. 7, 9, and 10, while on
some of the small ones, as fig. 11, nothing satisfactory has
yet been developed. In these figures           have endeavoured to     I
give the appearances which the objects present under the mi
croscope; and it will be observed, on a careful inspection of
them, that the lines on fig. 9, 10, and 13, (which are only
portions of scales,) are very different from those on fig. 5.
and 6, the former ones not being so sharp and defined as the
latter.
    As a general rule, it will be found that the smaller the
scales the more difficult the test; those in fig. 6, however,
cannot be included as tests, as they are very easily resolved.
I   must not omit to notice, also, that the cords on these scales
are loosely attached to the tissue, and are often rubbed off in
mounting. Of course it will be fruitless to examine such spe
cimens. Those on which the greatest reliance may be placed
are similar to fig. 5, though the same scale will assume          the                     all

the diamond beetle (Curculio imperialis) is shown at fig. 12.
Plate III.” The lines and markings on certain vegetable tis
sues, and many others too numerous to name, may also be
employed as proof objects. The reason for making a selection
of those above described, has been in order to render the task
of judging of the merits of an instrument by different indivi
duals more simple and satisfactory, so that by the assistance
of the drawings, and a sample of the objects, they may ascer
tain the quality of an instrument without the trouble of com
paring it with others, which are often difficult, and sometimes
impossible, to procure.

      The defining power of microscopes and                                                engiscopes depends

pear to be essential for the development of their structure, the
 degree of obliquity varying, however, with different specimens
 of scales.     The extremes of this variation are the Podura
plumbea and Pieris Brassica, the delicacy of the former re
 quiring almost central light, while the latter requires it very
oblique.     From this cause artificial illumination is to be pre
ferred to   day-light    for this class of objects, as the light of a
lamp or candle gives the rays diverging without any apparatus
whatever. The same effect, however, may be produced in
day-light, either with Dr. Wollaston's or Dr. Goring's illu
minator, where the rays, after meeting at the focus of their
illuminating lens, are permitted to diverge, and, by placing
the object out of the centre, oblique vision is obtained. In the
investigation of the class of objects now to be described, direct
parallel rays are preferable, and, indeed, in most cases are es
sential; and on this account they are scarcely ever well defined
by candle- or lamp-light. In these, therefore, clear day-light,
directed through the axis of the instrument, should be em
ployed.
    I. The hairs of the common mouse (Mus domesticus) differ
both in size and form; the principal varieties, with their rela
tive diameters, are shown in Plate III. fig. 14, 15, and 16.
These are drawn, as seen by transmitted light, and as proof
objects should have their transparent parts clearly and dis
tinctly separated from the darker portions.               This remark
holds good for the whole tribe of hairs and mosses, and it is
from the sharpness with which the parts are separated that a
correct opinion of the goodness of an instrument can be ob
tained. When these hairs are seen by reflected light, that                              is,

that size, I leave to those to determine who are better ac
quainted with the mathematical theory.
   The following experiments were made with a detached pen
dulum, both in vacuo and in air; a simple rod, with a knife
edge, being used; the clock pendulum was always adjusted to
the detached pendulum for the different extents of vibration,
and the rate of the clock was taken from another. In con
ducting the experiments in air, the pendulum was not removed,
the air being merely readmitted into the vessel.

    There being but a small difference between the results of
 the experiments in air and in exhaustion, with the brass bob
 of 5 pounds, and the results of those with the leaden bob
 of 10.5 pounds,      I  was led to suspect that the surface of the
 lead might have carried more air along with it than that of
 the brass, and thus have caused a greater current.                  I there
 fore varnished the leaden       bob,  and the results of      experiments
 with it were as follows:–

   These results show that the varnishing of the bob made
no difference in the time of the vibrations.   The apparent
difference between the results in air and in exhaustion arose
from the bob not being set precisely in     former place after        its
varnishing.

of 11 measures in fifty hours, 12 measures in eighty-nine hours,
 12 measures in ninety-seven hours; or 803 became 791. The
diffusion was slower, than usual, from the plug having been
partially wetted in filling the instrument with gas.

theory.
    In the case of the last three gases, when the experiment was
performed over water in a diffusion-tube, with free exposure to
the dry atmosphere, instead of any contraction ensuing, a po
sitive expansion generally occurred, which was to be attributed
to the return air, which was comparatively dry, being expanded
after entering the receiver.

simply determined by filling it with water, and weighing the
water which it contains, and which can be poured from it into
a counterpoised phial. Then, after any experiment, the re
turn-air may be found from the weight of the water which has
entered the instrument, determined in the same manner.                   By
proceeding in this way, we avoid wetting the stucco after every
experiment. A hood of damp paper may be inverted over
the upper tube while the diffusion is going on, and the whole
counterpoised in a tumbler of water, being suspended from
one of the arms of the beam of a balance, the scale on that side
being removed. An experiment with the bulb will generally
occupy several hours. But with a plain diffusion-tube, a much
shorter time will suffice.

Now, the gases were found by analysis to be uniformly                                      dif
fused through both bulbs; so that nitrogen and carbonic oxide
are of the same density, or at least do not differ more than
rºodth part, which was the limit of observation in the case of
these experiments. It appears, also, that inequality of density
is not an essential requisite in diffusion.
   I   had occasion to remark, more than once, a singular acci
dent to the stucco plugs. After being disused for some days
or weeks, and left in the interval exposed to the air, which
might be either dry or damp at the time, the plugs occasion
 ally, on a new trial, did not permit diffusion to take place
 through their pores, at least immediately.             Hydrogen, how
 ever, always opened a passage in the course of two or three
 minutes, and then the diffusion proceeded as rapidly as ever.
 Carburetted hydrogen, and the other gases, often required a
 longer period. A slight heat restored the action of the plug.
 The obstruction could not be attributed to moisture, nor to
 any thing but dust.
     It may be mentioned, that there was nothing peculiar in a
 mixture of two gases, in the proportion of the numbers ex
 pressing their diffusion-volumes;–nothing that could be con
 sidered an indication of mutual saturation.
     Evaporation, or the elevation of vapour from a liquid into
 air, or any other gas, comes now to be explained on the prin
 ciples of diffusion. The powerful disposition of the particles
 of different gaseous bodies to exchange positions, may as                                      ef.

piration, about 20 cubic inches, or #3th of the contents are
thrown out, from the application of a general pressure to
the whole.     But it is evident, that these twenty cubic inches
will be the twenty   cubic inches nearest the outlet, or the con
tents of the  larger  tubes.  The contents of the second-sized
tubes will advance at the same time into the largest tubes, but
no further, and will recede again into their original deposi
tories on the next inspiration, which will fill the larger tubes
with fresh air; which identical quantity will again be ex
pelled in the next expiration. This illustration is perhaps too
strongly stated; but it is evident that, in ordinary respiration,
the slight mechanical compression will have little or no effect
in emptying the most distant tubes, or the ultimate air-cells,
of their contents. The bulk of the air, also, is not altered du
ring respiration, although, for a quantity of oxygen, carbonic
acid gas is substituted.     This substitution, which is the great
end of respiration, undoubtedly takes place most abundantly
in the minute and distant air-cells, which present the largest
surface to the blood; and the carbonic acid there produced,
must be moved along the smaller tubes by the diffusion pro
cess, (which we know to be extremely energetic, and also in
evitable,) till it is thrown into the larger tubes, from which it
can be expelled by the ordinary action of respiration.         But
 the action of diffusion is always twofold: at the same time that
carbonic acid is being carried outward from the air-cells, oxy
gen is carried inward in exchange, and thus the necessary cir
 culation kept up throughout the whole lungs.
    Further, by a forced expiration, from 160 to 178 cubic
 inches may be expelled, after which, there still remain in the
 lungs about 120 cubic inches, which are not under the con
 trol of the respiratory action.
    There can be no doubt that much of this quantity occupies
 constantly and permanently the most minute tubes and air
 cells, for it can scarcely be withdrawn by means of the air
 pump. Now, the question has arisen, how these ultimate tubes
 and air-cells are so powerfully inflated; for they are not dis
 tended by the action of muscular fibre, of which they are
 known to be destitute. This state of distention must be highly
 useful, by exposing surface; and the law of diffusion enables
 us to account for   it.    The heavy carbonic acid which these
 minute cells may contain,      not merely exchanged for oxygen,
 but fora    larger  volumeof isoxygen,      the proportion

and there follows a tendency to accumulation on the side ori
ginally occupied by the carbonic acid. This accumulation is
limited by the increased facility with which the air-vessels can
empty themselves mechanically of a portion of their contents,
from their distended state.
    In the law of diffusion of gases, we have, therefore, a singu
lar provision for the full and permanent inflation of the ulti
                                                                  º

    But it is in the respiration of insects that the operation of
this law will be most distinctly perceived. The minute air
tubes accompanying the blood-vessels to every                 and like
them ramifying till they cease to be visible under the most
powerful microscope, are kept distended during the most lively
movements of the little animals, and the necessary gaseous
circulation maintained, wholly, we may presume, by the agency
of diffusion.
    In regard to the terms of the law of diffusion: “The dif
fusion, or spontaneous intermixture of two gases in contact, is
effected by an interchange in position of indefinitely minute
volumes of the gases.”     My experiments, published on a former
occasion, on the diffusion of mixed gases (Quarterly Journal
of Science, Sept. 1829), afford the first demonstration of the
fact, that diffusion takes place between the ultimate particles
of gases, and not between sensible masses, and therefore that
diffusion cannot be the result of accident.        For, in the case of
a mixture of two gases escaping from a receiver into the at
mosphere, by apertures of 0-12 and 0.07 inch in diameter, it
was not so much of the mixture which left the receiver in a
given time, but a certain proportion of each of the mixed gases,
independently of the other, corresponding to                individual its
diffusiveness.     The same separation             of
                                               mixed gases occurred
in   diffusion through the pores         of

makes up the deficiency. A gas, however, of large diffusion
volume escapes, in these circumstances, in a shorter time than
a gas of small diffusion-volume. Indeed, it was the conclusion
of the former paper, that gases diffuse more or less rapidly
according to some function of their densities, “apparently                                         in
versely as the square root of their densities.” The advantage,
in illustrating the process of diffusion, of minute apertures or
channels of communication, such as we have in the stucco
plug, depends upon the circumstance, that when a contraction
or expansion takes place in the gaseous contents of a diffusion
instrument, any current in an outward or inward direction is
prevented by frictional resistance; so that the simple result of
diffusion is exhibited, not complicated by the effect of any
other force.
    The law at which we have arrived (which is merely a de
scription of the appearances, and involves, I believe, nothing
hypothetic), is certainly not provided for in the corpuscular
philosophy of the day, and is altogether so extraordinary, that
I  may be excused for not speculating further upon         cause,                       its

   It appears, then, that the process       of diffusion into air through
stucco is four times more        rapid    in the case of hydrogen than
in that of   chlorine,  and twice as     rapid  in the case of the former
gas as in carbonic acid. The process of diffusion might be said
to proceed at a uniform rate, if the same quantity of air en
tered the instrument in the same time, whatever gas was dif
fused, and although the quantity of gas which escaped was
variable of course, and proportional to the respective diffusion
volume of the gas.         But this exchange of diffusion-volumes
takes   place  more   rapidly,  it appears, in the case of some gases
than of others.

 LIX.         Remarks on Chemical Changes                                      of Colour.               By H. F.
                                TALBot, Esq. M.P. F.R.S.*
VERY    little is known with certainty concerning the cause
  of those striking changes of colour which we so frequently
witness in chemical experiments. No theory has yet been pro
posed which will by any means account for the whole of them,
and we are often at a loss even for a plausible explanation.
And yet these phaenomena have probably some very close con
nexion with the ultimate constitution of bodies, and are there
fore well worthy of our particular attention.           I will therefore
mention a few facts relating to this subject, hoping to engage
others to pursue such inquiries further.
    Water, being a colourless substance, ought, one would ima
gine, when mixed with other substances possessing no decid
ed colour, to produce a colourless compound.                Nevertheless
it is to water only that the common vitriol or sulphate of cop
per owes           its
                 extremely vivid blueness;              plainly evinced             as    is
by      simple experiment.         For
                                                                                                                      of at

   is probable, however, that other laws are in operation
         this novel        of excitation, which are still more
                                process

velopment, experiments and a mode of reasoning of a very
different order to those which have been employed for orga
nizing the system of proximate laws already explained.
   It appears to me that electric currents generated by mag
netic agency are not the immediate effects of the magnet em
ployed in the excitation. It is highly probable that there is
a mediate or intervening agent called forth;—the magnet
ism natural to the excited metal, which, by being polarized
by the exciting polar magnetic lines of the magnet, becomes
the immediate agent in giving life and energy to the previously
dormant electricity of the metal.
    Remote and mysterious as the intermediate agency of the
natural magnetism of the metal in this process of exciting
electricity may appear in the present infantile stage of the
science,   I have much reason to suppose that such is the fact.
The    phaenomena     in magnetic-electricity, as well as those in
electro-magnetism, are highly favourable to the hypothesis;

rent and the magnet employed; but the illustrations which
have been advanced by that gentleman might possibly re
quire considerable modification to establish a theory on those
principles.
     Ihave heard brought forward, as an argument against the
hypothesis of magnetic polarity of the conducting wire, an
experiment of Sir H. Davy's, which showed the deflection of
an electric current passing through air between the charcoal
points of a voltaic battery, by the presentation of a magnetic
pole. Such arguments can have but very little force in dis
cussions of this character; for the experiment develops nothing
 different to the generality of electro-magnetic phaenomena.
If   an electric current be capable of rousing into activity the
 dormant magnetic powers of ferruginous matter, no doubt
 can possibly be entertained of             susceptibility its being put                     of

  368    Mr. W. Sturgeon                 on the Theory           of Magnetic Electricity.
      The  retention of magnetic polarity is displayed to the
  greatest extent by very hard steel.   After this the retentive
   faculty diminishes with various grades of hardness down to
   soft steel; thence by gradations downwards to the softest iron,
   which exhibits the faculty of retaining magnetic polarity, only
   in a very slight degree indeed.            But the facility of magneti
   zing those bodies, and the extent to which their polarity is ex
   hibited, are in precisely the reverse order.
      Now, as the retention of polarity appears to result from a
  want of facility, on the part of the metal, to readmit the mag
  netic matter which the exciting agent has arranged into active
  polar lines on         its
                         surface and vicinal medium; and                    those             as
  metals which display the retentive faculty                   the greatest de

                                         as
 reason,    as similar terms are employed               electricity. in
     Under these considerations             will  appear    that hard steel                             is
 an   exceedingly bad conductor                    of it
                                             magnetism; because            offers             it
a   very great resistance                to
                                  the motion                     of
                                                      the magnetic matter.
 This resistance causes the process                         of
                                                   magnetizing          become           to
 exceedingly tedious; and with very hard cast steel                         very              it
 seldom terminates        successfully,                 or
                                                    the satisfaction

 operator. Hence,             practical point
                               in
                                a                      view,     of interestingitis
 to  know that magnets constructed                          of
                                                   cast steel should never
 be harder than the blue       temper.
     Soft iron being the best ferruginous conductor                        mag             of
netism, offers       much less resistance

netic matter than when                any other state. The vigorous
                                              in
polar magnetic lines are therefore speedily arranged, and                                          to   an
extent   of  concentration never                        be

face  of  very hard steel.
    But the same conducting quality which gives                     soft iron    to                     a
facility   of excitation, also gives        facility
                                                   a       the return to     the              of
magnetic matter into the metal when the exciting agent                                                  is
withdrawn; for which reason the retention                        polarity dis  of

                               is          feeble,   and   easily  deranged.

 cerned, the vigorous retention of magnetic polarity exhibited
 by some of them, and the almost total absence of this quality
 in others, may very easily be explained upon the principles
 already advanced; and perhaps it would only require that we
 should consider copper and other non-ferruginous metals to
 be still better magnetic conductors than soft iron, to reconcile
 the sudden and total disappearance of polarity in them to the
 same principles, whether the exciting agent be magnetic or
 electric.                                                                                                             -
      Ihave deflected a magnetic needle by an electric current
 traversing an ignited charcoal conductor, as was first shown
 by the very interesting experiments of Mr. Kemp ; but as we
 are not aware of the total absence of the magnetic matter in
 charcoal, the experiment is inconclusive, any further than as
 an interesting fact, which has no particular bearing on the
 present discussion.
    The energies of ferruginous electro-magnets are invariably
exalted by multiplying, to a certain extent, the number of coils
of conducting wire. My large electro-magnet, described in
a former communication, requires twelve coils to accomplish
 its maximum          power (400 pounds).

LXIII.      Note on Mr. Potter's Reply.  By WILLIAM R.                             HA
*   MILTON, Esq. Andrews' Professor of Astronomy in the                            Uni
    versity of Dublin, and Royal Astronomer of Ireland *.
     ROM Mr.     Potter's Reply, published in the April Num
     ber of the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine,
I  collect some additional facts respecting his experiment of
prismatic interference, which do not seem to have been stated
in his first account of that experiment. In Mr. Potter's first
paper, the stress of his objection to the undulatory theory of
light seemed to be laid on the observed direction of a certain
deviation; to which he opposed his calculated decrease of a
certain hyperbolic ordinate.                 I
                                 showed that this observed fact,
of deviation in the observed direction (towards the thickness
of the prism), could be accounted for by the prismatic aber
ration of figure, which changed the decreasing hyperbolic                          or
dinate to an increasing ordinate of a certain other curve. But
I  was of course aware that this prismatic aberration, though
a cause acting in the observed direction, might not be ener
getic enough to account for the whole, or even for the greatest
part of the observed effect; and that whether aberration was,
or was not, an adequate as well as a real cause (on the undu
latory theory of light), must depend on the comparison of my
calculated formulae with the observed magnitude of the devia
tion, of which Mr. Potter had not given any measure, or even
any estimate.       I
                   am happy to have been the means of indu
cing Mr. Potter to bring forward some additional testimony
on this important point: and willingly admit, that according
to this new testimony, there remains, after allowing for my
suggestions, a large residual phaenomenon.

at Calcutta, under the title of “ Gleanings in Science;” a work        in
tended to contain a mixture of original communications and of extracts
from the best scientific journals of Europe.   From the abundance and
importance of the original communications, the “ Gleanings in Sci
ence” soon became as replete with novel matter as any other publi
cation of the same kind; and the success of the work was so consi
derable in India, that application was made to publish it under the
auspices of the Asiatic Society.        The request was immediately
granted, with the understanding that the permission was to be con
tinued as long as the publication should be under the charge of one
or both of the Secretaries of the Society. Hence the change of title
 and present name.
    Under the modest title of “ Gleanings in Science,” the first three
volumes contain numerous and valuable papers on the Meteorology,
 Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology, Literature, and Statistics of India, to
 gether with numerous chemical analyses of Indian products, and
 criticisms on works of science relating to India.    We would particu
 larly draw attention to the papers of Messrs. Wilson, Herbert,
 Prinsep, Hodgson, Benson, Paddington, Everest, and Buchanan;
 many of whom are already well known to the European public.
    The first Number of the “Journal” before us contains a paper by
 Mr. Wilson (now Professor of Sanscrit in the University of Oxford,)
 on the contents of the Dul-va; a memoir by Mr. Hodgson on the
 Native method of making Paper; an account of a new genus of Land
 Shells, by Mr. Benson; an examination of Minerals from Ava, by
 Mr. Prinsep ; an account of a new Bridge near Hyderabad; a method
 of rectifying a Route Protraction; a comparison of the Indus and
 Ganges; a Summary of Meteorological Observations made at Calcutta
 in 1829, 1830, and 1831; an account of the Earthquake at Lahore in
  183 l ; with a notice of the Population of Allahabad.      To these are
 added, the proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, of the Me
 dical and Physical Society, and of the Natural History Society of
 the Mauritius; proceedings which are also noticed in the other
  Numbers.
     The other two Numbers contain memoirs of equal interest; among
 which we may mention Mr. Royle's papers on his collections of Na
  tural History made in the Himalayan Mountains, &c., and on the
  Botanic Garden at Seharanpore;        Mr. Benson's remarks on the
  Antelope Hodgsonii; Mr. Wilson's analysis of the Poranas; an ac
 count of the progress of the Trigonometrical Survey of India; Hourly
  Observations on the Barometer in the Fortress of Cavita, &c.

  of the Journal of the Asiatic Society from this sketch of    its

  We have little doubt that the cultivators of science in Europe will
be greatly gratified by the evidence this Journal affords of the activity
of the scientific men in India; and that the work itself will prove
highly valuable to them, adding, as it does so materially, to our stock
of knowledge, more especially as regards that most interesting portion
of the world.

of a fluid refracting Telescope of eight inches aperture and eight feet
nine inches in length, made for the Royal Society by George Dollond,
Esq. F.R.S.” By Peter Barlow, Esq. F.R.S.
   The author has, in former papers read to this Society, pointed out
the great variety of cases included under the general formulae relating
to the operation of fluid refracting telescopes, and stated the difficulty
of selecting, independently of experiment, the particular case which
was likely to produce the best result. This subject is pursued in the
present paper; and the principles and calculations stated at length
which the author has applied in the construction of the telescope
which the Council of the Royal Society directed should be made by
Mr. Dollond, under the superintendence of the author, in order to
put these principles to the test of experiment, and to decide the ques
tion of the expediency of proceeding in the construction of a similar
telescope of much larger dimensions. When the experimental tele
scope was completed, it was found that                    its
                                             performance agreed       every               in

Report      of    the Council to the Anniversary Meeting on                                              St. Andrew's
                                   Day, 1832.
The Council of   the Royal Society have, during the past year, used
their most earnest endeavours to render the Library as effective for the
purposes of science, as the means at their disposal would enable them.
They   have been desirous, in particular, to make            it as complete as pos
 sible in   allthose    departments        science,     of
                                                      which          more especially       it   to is
 the   object     of
                   the   Royal   Society       cultivate and to     advance.     They
 have   accordingly    purchased,   with the advice       the  Library   Committee,
                                                                                of

                                      the Society would               little avail            be    of                   to

errors obviously arising from inaccurate transcription.            The Council
have also directed a general Index to be made of the contents of the
Transactions from the year 1821 to 1830 inclusive.
   Documents relating to the periods and heights of the Tides having
been furnished to the Society, at the request of the Council, by favour
of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who have obligingly
ordered these returns to be made from the principal sea-ports of En
gland, a Committee has been appointed for the purpose of examining
and digesting them, and for printing such of the observations or
results as they may deem useful.
   The Committee for conducting the Meteorological Observations
have been anxious to arrange a plan for insuring their accuracy, and
increasing their utility.       They find that standard instruments are
much wanted for furnishing correct data in this department of science.
This deficiency they are endeavouring to supply; and have in par
ticular been promised the kind assistance of Mr. Daniell and Dr.
Prout in superintending the construction of a standard barometer of
superior accuracy, on the indications of which they expect that the
utmost reliance may be placed.
   The telescope, which the Council, with the advice of a Committee,
had requested Mr. Barlow to construct as an experiment, on the
principles stated by him in his paper in the Philosophical Transac
tions, is now completed, and will soon be ready for trial.
   The Council have awarded one of the Copley Medals to Mr.
Faraday, for          his
                     discovery       Magneto-Electricity,

     same time establishes an important distinction among bodies which
     had long been considered as associated by phenomena common to
     them all; and gives indisputable evidence of electric action due to
     terrestrial magnetism alone. An important addition is thus made to
     the facts which have long been accumulating for the solution of that
     most interesting problem, the magnetism of the earth.
        The Council have awarded another Copley Medal to M. Poisson,
     for his work entitled Nouvelle Théorie de l'Action Capillaire.            In this
     work a great variety of problems are solved relative to molecular
     attraction, some of which had not before been attempted; but the most

     April 2, 1833. –A paper                      was read, entitled,         “On the Modifica
tions of AEstivation observable in certain Plants formerly referred
to the Genus Cinchona.” By Mr. David Don, Libr. L.S.
   The aestivation of corolla is much more varied in monopetalous
than in polypetalous flowers, for, with the exception of a portion of
the Rutaceae, principally from New Holland and South America, the
imbricate form is found almost generally to prevail in the latter
class. Among the monopetalous orders the form of aestivation is a
character of such high value as oftentimes to afford the only pal
pable distinction to the limitation of families; but the Rubiaceae
present a striking exception, examples of almost every modification
of aestivation being afforded by it; and although among them it is a
character of less value, still it will be found materially to assist in
distinguishing the genera of that extensive family.
   The genera enumerated and described by the author are Cin
chona, Cosmibuena, Erostema, Hymenodictyon, Luculia, Pinckneya,
and a new one, founded upon the Cinchona rosea of the Flora Pe
ruviana, which he has named and characterized as follows:–
                 LAsionEMA.                  Cinchonae sp. Ruiz          et   Pavon.
     Calyr 5-dentatus. Corolla tubulosa, limbo 5-fida,                                 aestivatione    im
bricata.      Stamina exserta: filamenta medio barbata: antherae sub
rotundae, peltatae       biloculares; loculis basi solutis.         Stigma bilo
bum.     Capsula    bilocularis,  medio  loculicido-dehiscens!       polysperma.
Semina    exigua,    Samaroidea.     Arbor   (peruviana)   inflorescentid pani
culatd.

   This constitutes a very distinct genus, differing from Cinchona
not only in        its                                                                                     of

   This elegant little plant was first discovered by the late Mr. Don
in the summer of 1795; and again accidentally met with in consider
able abundance by Sir John Ogilvie, Bart. in August last.         The
specimens from Clova agree in every respect with those in the Lin
naean Herbarium, . The capsule in this plant is uniformly five-celled,
but the thin partitions in the advanced state are found occasionally
partially obliterated.
           MULGEDIUM ALPINUM.                  Sonchus alpinus       of Linnaeus.
   The late Mr. Don was acquainted with several stations for this
plant; and Dr. Graham's party found it in five different places, some
of them being seven or eight miles apart.       One or two of the sta
tions are fortunately quite inaccessible, so that the plant is not likely
to be entirely eradicated.
   It is singular that of this, which is also a Lapland plant, there is
no specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium; the two so named are North
American species, and apparently from the Upsal garden; one of
them being Sonchus floridanus, and the other example (which has
also the number of the Species Plantarum attached to it,) Sonchus
spicatus of Lamarck, the Leucophaeus of Willdenow. Both these are
also species of Mulgedium; and our late excellent President, misled
by the number attached to the specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium,
has been induced to publish this last as the real alpinus, substitu
ting for the actual plant the name of caeruleus. All these plants more
naturally associate with Lactuca than with Sonchus, only differing
from the former in the less attenuated apex of the achenia,

   “The observers at Dr. Van Beek's house saw nothing of this
singular phaenomenon.                                            -
   & Some observers state, that in former transits a coloured lighter
ring seemed to surround the orb of Mercury on the Sun's disc.
According to Plantade, an appearance of the sort was seen at the
transit of 1736. Flaugergues saw the same in May 1786, in Nov.
1789 and 1799. He calls it an illuminated ring, un anneau lumineur.
Nothing, however, of the kind is mentioned in Delambre's account
of the transit of 1799, nor in that of Messier of that of 1786. Pros
perin and Ferner, however, speak of it as observed during the transit
of 1786. But the most circumstantial account of the phenomenon
is that of Harding and Schröder, during the transit of 1799. They
                                             of it,

suggested by the study of Egyptian antiquities. After the meeting
 Dr. Jermyn exhibited various antiquities, found in association with
bones partly interred and partly deposited in urns, which have been
discovered at Exning and Bartlow in this neighbourhood.
   Professor Sedgwick also gave an account, illustrated by drawings
and sections, of the geology of North Wales.           He stated, that by
various traverses across Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire, it was
ascertained that the strata of that district are bent into saddles and
troughs, of which the anticlinal and synclinal lines occur alternately,
and are         all
             nearly parallel       the “great Merionethshire anticlinal

 is decomposed to that at which it is volatilized, made it difficult to

  exhibited more novelty, made more numerous experiments, and ob

          of the    Centenary    of the Birth of Dr. Priestley.           383
tained more important and valuable results, than could be justly
claimed on behalf of any of his cotemporaries.
    To the correctness of this statement I have reason to expect that
satisfactory testimony will be given, in the course of the evening, by
several friends present, whose authority on this subject will not be
disputed. If in estimating what we owe to the discoveries of this
most sagacious and successful inquirer, I may be allowed to refer to
the benefits which they have conferred upon mankind in reference to
my own profession,       I may ask what, before the time of Priestley, did
we know of the constitution of the atmosphere, of the composition
of water, of the nature of mineral springs? And were we not com
paratively ignorant of the composition of metallic oxides, mineral
acids, and many other of the most active articles of the Materia
Medica?       I may also be permitted to remind you, that for the pur
pose of applying certain of the elastic fluids, or gases, to the treat
ment of pulmonic diseases, Dr. Beddoes, of the University of Oxford,
quitted his employment as professor, to settle himself at Bristol; and
that it was to the necessity of his requiring assistance in this pursuit
that we are indebted for the additional light thrown on chemical re
search by the genius of the immortal Davy.              Had oxygen gas alone
been the fruit of Dr.      Priestley's  investigations,  the obligations con
ferred on our      profession  must have been indelible.      Of this I might
adduce a    proof   by referring  to an  occurrence,  the particulars of which
were made public by myself in the year 1807; and as they may be
considered not altogether irrelevant, I will, with your permission,
briefly state them.
     Two persons, servants in a public-house in the neighbourhood of
 Aldermanbury, where I then resided, the one a lad of 13 years old,
 the other a man of 35, having gone to bed in a small room in which
 a brasier of lighted charcoal had been left burning, were found the
 next morning in a state of complete insensibility. The lad had fallen
 on the floor, and appeared quite lifeless; and all endeavours at re
 suscitation in his case proved unsuccessful. In the man some signs
 of life still remained. Before my arrival he had been removed into
 a large chamber, and a few ounces of blood had been taken from his
 arm. From these measures, however, no improvement had been ef
 fected. I found him still quite insensible; his countenance pale, his
 respiration imperfect, his pulse sinking, his tongue protruding, and
 his under jaw in a state of spasm.          In this apparently almost hope
 less  state,  it occurred that the most    likely  means of restoring vitality
 would be to       produce   artificial respiration, and at the same time to
  employ oxygen gas in place of atmospheric air. Having by good
  fortune a portable galvanic trough at mycommand, and being promptly
  supplied by my friend, Mr. William Allen, with the necessary quan
  tity of oxygen gas, there was little or no loss of time in making the
  experiment.       Nothing could be more satisfactory than the result.
  At every application of the galvanic conductor to the lower and an
  terior part of the chest, a muscular spasm ensued, by which the chest
  was expanded, and an opportunity was consequently given for the
  introduction of the oxygen gas with obvious effect.           By a repetition

   384          Addresses delivered at the Commemoration
   and continuance of this proceeding, we had the gratification to find
  that our endeavours were completely successful, the man being in the
   end restored to health.
      Not considering myself at liberty to trespass further on your time,
   I have now, Gentlemen, to request that you will rise from your seats,
  and, in reverential silence, drink “To the Memory of Dr. Joseph
  Priestley, the Founder of Pneumatic Chemistry.”
      The President next called upon the assembly to mark in a similar
  manner its respect for the memory of those other distinguished indi
  viduals of our country who laboured with Dr. Priestley in the same
  field of science, and who have since also paid the debt of nature.
  The list, he observed, would be long, commencing with Black, Ca
  vendish, and Kirwan, and ending with Wollaston and Davy.
     The meeting was then      addressed as follows by Dr. DAUBENy, Pro
  fessor of   Chemistry   at Oxford,   whose name had been connected by
 the President with an      expression  of respect for that University.
      In the name of the   University  of Oxford, I beg leave to return you
 my best thanks for the honour you have done that body on the present
 occasion. I receive the toast with the greater satisfaction, as an evi
 dence of the good feeling that subsists, and which I trust may ever be
 maintained, between men engaged in the common cause of discover
 ing and of disseminating truth, whether they may chance to belong
 to the older institutions of the country, or to those which have more
 recently sprung up amongst us. I can assure you, on the part of
 the University, that the same feeling is reciprocally felt towards
 you; and that although we in Oxford are considered to be more          in
 tent on training and disciplining the minds of youth for the future
 reception of scientific knowledge than in inculcating the facts of
 any particular science, yet that for this very reason perhaps we are
 the more sensible of the debt of gratitude we owe to such indivi
 duals as the one we are this day met to commemorate, who acted
 as the pioneer in a new path of discovery,            fully aware that our
 theories and    systems,   however   logical  and ingenious   they may be,
 would, without the assistance of the facts brought together by the
labours of these experimentalists, turn out as baseless and as unsub
 stantial, as are those of the ancients on matters of physics, whose
writings amuse us in our closets.           Neither ought an ecclesiastical
body like ours to be unmindful of the services rendered even to the
cause of religion by one in particular of Dr. Priestley's chemical dis
coveries; I mean that of the carbonic acid exhaled by animals being
found to constitute the food of plants, a discovery which, more
perhaps than any other within the whole range of chemistry, is cal
culated to evince the adaptation of one part of nature to another,
and which, ripened and confirmed as it has been by the subsequent
researches of Saussure and others, suggests to us the means by
which the Creator preserves to the atmosphere, unchanged, even to
the end of time, that identical constitution and those precise pro
perties, which we know to be best adapted to the wants of the ani
mal and the vegetable creation; ordaining that every blade of grass

                of the Centenary of the Birth of Dr. Priestley.                                                          385
which we tread under our feet shall contribute to supply the waste
of oxygen     caused by the respiration of land animals, whilst the sea
weed, the “inutilis alga” as the poet terms                  and the conferva that it,
grows       on
             the surface       the stagnant pool, compensate for that occa
                                      of
sioned by the aquatic tribes.
 I    think, therefore, this Anniversary well deserves                   attended by           to      be
others besides    professed     chemists,   and that its celebration will con
tribute     tothe prosperity not only               the branch     of science which             of
Dr. Priestley especially cultivated, but even                 other departments    of                                         of

derived from other applications              their talents,            least equally               at

durable, and certainly less open             controversy. Had, may remark,                         I

   One point                in        Dr. Priestley                of

pleasure      noticing, because
                of                 feel myself called upon   I   vindicate
him   inthis respect.   Some persons speak        him merely           ex                  of                               as    an
perimenter, who tried results        variety    shapes, and   in  accident
                                                                   a                    of                              by
attained some happy discoveries.        But the persons       now address                                    I
must      well aware that these results are only seen
          be                                                    persons                                            by                  of
keen observation,--by persons who are able          appreciate what they                     to
observe.        Iffacts have remained unnoticed before           common eyes,                               by
surely the man deserves credit who               not only able       see, but                                      to                  to
point out                                                     of              he is
                is to

    There       another point            considered      to    be

                           was less capable       systematizing the results     of                                                     of

Every one, am sure, regrets that His Royal Highness has lately
                I
suffered    much from illness; and were
               so                               not still indisposed,                   he                                             I

 am convinced he would be present. There are many circumstances,
 I think,
        connected with the name of Priestley, which must be very
 gratifying to the members of the Royal Society. First, Dr. Priestley
 was one of its Fellows; and next, we have the satisfaction and the
 great pride, that the Transactions of the Royal Society are the de
 positories of his discoveries.      We have also the satisfaction of know
 ing that the Council of the Royal Society at that time were not
 unmindful of the very great merit of his communications; for in the
 same year that his first paper on the Properties of Air was commu
 nicated, they gave to him the Copley Medal, which was the highest
 honour they could bestow, and which                                       is,
                                                                        Sir John
                                                                                                      of of
                                                      the words                  in
 Pringle, who presented             him, “the palm and laurel
                                          it    to                      our com
 munity.”      The paper for which the Copley Medal was given, was
 not that which has been          much admired,so     the discovery       oxygen on                         of
 gas; but that which contained the analysis               atmospheric air with        of
 nitrous gas; and        contained also (which was not much considered
                                it
 at the time,) the relation       his having received muriatic acid gas over
                                               of
 quicksilver, and introduced particles           water, showing that the gas
                                                                      of
 was immediately absorbed by the water. These and many other
papers        he
              contributed      the Royal Society; which show the great
                                          to
use      the Society
        of                 that time, when there were not
                                 at                                    many So                        so
cieties      there are now, nor
             as                         many scientific journals.
                                                     so
 I    am convinced there          no one present who does not wish pros

of the honour you have conferred upon me, being                                                 really at a loss to
account for it;-only as the friend of Watson,                                                    of Davy, and of

Young, can presume to receive such an honour                                                    from you.     I feel
great pleasure in meeting so many distinguished men of science as
sembled to do honour to the memory of that illustrious philosopher
Dr. Priestley. All chemists owe him the greatest obligations; but
I  feel peculiar obligations to him; I am under personal obligations
to him;-not that I ever knew him, or ever spoke to him more than
once. In very early youth, by mere accident, I obtained possession
of his first two volumes, entitled “Experiments and Observations on
different kinds of Air.” These two volumes caught my attention,
and first directed my thoughts to chemistry. I studied                  with one                          it,
other book which was lying about my father's house, the Dispensatory
of   Colville,    which    to prefixed      short history

dica. As        Dr.  Priestley's

                                                                      is                             it
caught my attention; there                everything    is        captivate the       in   it    to

fail      observe the beautiful perspicuity with which he relates his

which is equivalent to respiration in vegetation.            will, therefore,                I
take the liberty of adverting to that part of Dr. Priestley's character
which I think tends to illustrate his attainments as a chemist.
     I
     had the honour of being Dr. Priestley's pupil in early life; I was
much in his laboratory, took notes for him, saw his method of pro
ceeding; and without having had the opportunity of seeing him as I
did, I think no one can be fully aware of his merits, his enthusiasm,
his originality, his quickness in meeting                               all
                                                difficulties that occurred,
and      taking advantage
           in                                      all
                                   points which started up under his
                                              of
notice.       has been said by some persons that his success
                It                                                     expe                                 in

jumping about without aim        method.     Now that was not the case:
                                               or
 he had the eye and the mind            philosopher; and the number

                                   of                             his mind.                       in                     I
say not so; and may affirm, without any derogation from Dr. Priest
                        I
ley's talents, that the very point                         on
                                           which his mind was most firmly
fixed was that where he has the least credit, the doctrine                 Phlo                               of
giston.     His constancy there was          constancy      aerror; and where           in

                    it                truth. By that spirit

                                                                        I               to
licly my gratitude         Priestley, the discoverer
                                  to                        oxygen,      Priest        of                     to
ley, the founder          pneumatic chemistry. His various merits have
                              of
 been proclaimed this evening; but             would say    Ifew words more            a                                 on

392             Addresses delivered at the Commemoration
one of them,-namely, his merit in the character I have last men
tioned.    I would not be understood as wishing to pass by the great
merits of others, his fellow-labourers in the field of science at that
time.    I would not deprive of one tittle of their well-deserved fame,
our countrymen Cavendish and Black:              I
                                             would not pass by without
due mention those splendid names, Lavoisier and Scheele.             No,
Sir; they have done their part; they made discoveries; they deduced
accurate inferences from facts which they observed.        But Priestley
invented a new department of science.       He taught us to confine, to
manipulate with, to collect gases; he invented the pneumatic trough;
he invented the mercurial bath; he gave us our instruments; and from
his time pneumatic chemistry has been cultivated with increasing zeal
and success.     It is with this explanation that I consider him as the
founder of   pneumatic   chemistry.
   It is delightful  to think that that low estimate of Dr. Priestley's
scientific character which was once entertained,—so low, indeed, that
it was said his discoveries were made by accident, it is pleasing to
think, that not only in this room, not only in this country, are his
merits fully recognised; but if we go to rival nations,—rivals now
only, I may say, in science,—if we go to France, we find there due
honour done to the scientific merits of Priestley by one whose re
cent loss science is now deploring, by one, of whose great talents the
whole community of science unite in testifying and recording their
admiration,--I mean the lamented Cuvier.               He has passed a just
eulogy on the merits of Dr. Priestley, which will never be forgotten
by this country or by the world.                                                             -
   The merits of Dr. Priestley, then, are duly recognised. But I
cannot sit down without drawing the attention of this Meeting to
one other point in the character of Dr. Priestley.           Mr. Faraday has
held him  up   as a  pattern  for that  facility  of change   of opinion, that
openness of mind, which every philosophic spirit ought to possess.
To every one who cultivates science I would further hold him up
as a pattern of philosophic liberality and candour.             Dr. Priestley,
when he had made a        discovery,    did not lock it   up  in his closet, in
order that he alone     might   pursue   the  inquiries  suggested  by      and   it,
deprive others     of
                    the merit   of assisting in  the research:      brought
                                                                        he              it
out before the public, and made          the property        every one. This
                                                          be of
                                       it
trait in the character     of  Dr.  Priestley   cannot      too much praised.
Allied  to  this was the     ingenuous     feeling   which led Dr. Priestley
to  make known the       very   mistakes which       he committed; these                he
gloried    intelling.   “I   could,” says he,        have kept this blunder
                                                     “
to  myself, but publish
                  I          it   to tell the world with what little skill
persons may make discoveries.”

  that we owe that honour solely to our being established in the town
  which was the residence of the great man the centenary of whose
  birth we are this evening met to celebrate.              I am afraid we cannot
  claim him for our founder; but I have no doubt that the Institution
  owes    itsorigin         to
                         that attention       scientific pursuits which his dis

     We have heard most interesting accounts                    the merits         of

                                              of
 near Birmingham, another very eminent man was resident there, the
 late Dr. Parr; and though there was repulsion between those two   a
 great men           on
                    some subjects, yet the attractions             kindred genius       of
 overcame all those        feelings,   and   they   were friends and associates
 amid all the tumults          party.     Dr. Parr stood forward
                                         of                              the advo                    as

394        Addresses delivered at the Commemoration
are now met to celebrate.      I consider it to be one of the most for
tunate circumstances of    my  life that I was a pupil of that eminent
man; and indeed I may say that my father before me was also a
pupil of his. It is rather a remarkable circumstance that there are
two gentlemen present, Dr. Bostock and myself, who were pupils in
the same class, and that our fathers were pupils likewise.         I trust
we have benefited by the instructions we received from that very
eminent teacher of experimental philosophy.         I can truly say, the
circumstance of  my  life which more than  any  other I have the pleasure
of  looking back  upon   was the  great satisfaction I had in being em
ployed in assisting Dr. Priestley in his laboratory when he removed
from Birmingham to Hackney.
   The name of John TAYLoR, Esq., having been similarly associated
with that of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, the assembly
was addressed as follows by that gentleman:—
   In noticing the Society with which you have done me the honour
of coupling my name, I shall have to introduce to your notice the
names of many of the associates of Dr. Priestley.         The Society of
Civil Engineers, which bears the name of Smeaton, was founded at
a time when general improvement was rapidly extending.               Soon
after the year 1760, when canals began to spread over the kingdom,
and when many useful arts were put into motion, Smeaton, the great
founder of that Society, proposed the formation of this association for
discussing subjects of practical use and scientific interest. When I
mention the names of some of the members of that Society, you will
find there were many whose minds were congenial with the views
which Dr. Priestley entertained. The Society originally included
those of Smeaton, James Watt, Priestley, Whitehurst, Boulton,
Rennie, Mylne, and Jessop; these were the professional engineers
that were amongst the first members of the Society. To these were
afterwards added, as honorary members, gentlemen who took an in
terest in the nature and objects of the Society,+Sir Joseph Banks,
Captain Huddart, Dr. Hutton, Lord Morton, Ramsden, Troughton,
and Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn.         This Society began with small
means; and I may also notice that, with the exception of the Royal
Society, it was the only one which Dr. Priestley belonged to in Lon
don. The evenings were spent in the discussion of some interesting
philosophical questions. The Society has continued to enrol several
distinguished names, such as Chapman, Mylne, Rennie, Walker,
Jessop, Jardine, Stephenson, Giles, and Cubitt; and we have, as
honorary members, Davies Gilbert, Troughton, Dollond, Watt, Ewart,
Chantrey, Babbage, Colby, Baily, Beaufort, and Seppings, with
other men well known to the scientific world. With such associates,
and with a mind like Dr. Priestley's, which had a peculiar tendency
to everything that was practically useful, for I think that if we go
through his most brilliant discoveries, we shall always find him taking
plain and practical views, and inquiring to what useful end they might
be employed for the good of mankind,-with such men, I say, it was
no wonder that his attention was directed towards experimental phi

              of the   Centenary      of the Birth of Dr. Priestley.         395
losophy. In the history of his life it is said, that coming to London,
as was his custom, a month every year, his acquaintance with Dr.
Watson, Dr. Price, Mr. Canton, and Dr. Franklin commenced about
 1766; and then his first attempts at experimental philosophy began.
I  think, however, there is evidence of his attachment to experimental
philosophy much earlier. I was looking this morning at a letter
which Dr. Priestley wrote to my grandfather respecting two of his
first pupils, my late revered uncle, and the father of my friend at my
left hand, Dr. Rigby, and I find that he particularly mentions in that
letter that out of school hours he directs the attention of his pupils
to natural philosophy as an amusement, and that they have the use
of his library and apparatus for this purpose, and were engaged in
experiments. I also find that when it was proposed he should be
come a tutor at the Dissenting Academy at Warrington, the depart
ment assigned to him was that of languages: he then represented that
he should have been more gratified to have undertaken that of natural
philosophy. He however went to Warrington, and became Professor
of languages; he taught Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, and Italian;
he lectured, I believe with distinction, on civil law : some time after
that he contrived his Chart of Biography, and subsequently his Chart
of History, which, I believe, are the types of everything of that kind
which has since been produced. Dr. Priestley, besides all his other
studies, was an astronomer, though we do not generally know him
in that capacity. He was applied to to accompany Captain Cook as
astronomer in his second voyage round the world; some objection
was raised, however, and it was given to Dr. Foster, who was also a
tutor at Warrington.     On this occasion, Dr. Priestley, with his usual
candour, says, “It is given to a man far better qualified than myself,
as I know but little of natural history, though I think I could have
worked myself up to the point had it been necessary.”
    With such men as Smeaton, and Watt, and Whitehurst, it was not
unlikely that Dr. Priestley's attention should be turned to that line
of science which he afterwards pursued with so much success.            In
his visits to London he became more acquainted with scientific men,
and was excited to the pursuit of natural philosophy.         His industry
was most extraordinary; and, as an instance, I may mention that
he proposed to Dr. Franklin to write a history of electricity.         Dr.
Franklin approved the plan, and offered to furnish the books neces
sary for the purpose. In less than twelve months he sent Dr. Franklin
a printed copy of the work.     He lectured during that year five hours
a day; he made the experiments for that work, finished the drawings
for     it,
        and     apologizes
                he               in
                               one    his letters for its being one
                                            of                         his  of
most hasty productions.      The work maintains, notwithstanding,                a
very high regard among those who follow that science.
    Dr. Priestley had particular aptitude
                          a                      turning his knowledge
                                                       in
    useful purposes.       In
                           executing this very work,        he
in to

couth and unpleasant          to
                             look at.    He examined into the cause,
found that the defect was        the perspective, and, setting
                                   in                                work,

it is to wade through such        an elaborate and abstract work; but
Dr. Priestley  applied   himself to the task, learned the art, and applied
it successfully;   and,   what is more, gave to the world the clearest
treatise on  perspective   which has been seen to this day. It contains
                                                                                                       of up

 of   the people were shortened. Dr. Priestley saw                     once that this            at
 might     be altered, and invented           most simple plan for the purpose,

says, he found that water might be impregnated with carbonic acid
gas; he supposes this may be useful, and therefore he gives freely to
the public the result of his inquiries.
   Perhaps, after all, one of the most extraordinary features in the
character of Dr. Priestley was the unexampled industry with which
he pursued the numerous subjects that came under his observation.
It is really surprising that a man who was engaged in deep read
theological and metaphysical research, who taught languages, who
gave instruction in civil law, who illustrated perspective and other
useful arts, and attended to astronomy, should be able to do all this,
and conduct the numerous experiments which were requisite during
the progress of his History of Electricity and that of the Disco
veries relating to Vision, Light, and Colours, both being elaborate
works, requiring immense labour and diligence.        Add to these the
subjects which have been so well noticed by those who have preceded
me at this meeting,                all
                           pursued with truly philosophic spirit, and

this table     the present occasion, Mr. Pepys, who has contributed
               on

 398        Addresses delivered at the Commemoration
very largely to the knowledge we at present possess on this subject;
and also to Dr. Bostock, who has also given his attention to that
function:—I am sure they are ready to confirm what I have now
stated. I think, therefore, that the discoveries of Dr. Priestley on the
subject of respiration may be regarded as among the happiest efforts
of his penetrating genius, inasmuch as they have contributed to
establish and fix correct views of that function.     Every cultivator of
natural  history must feel that Dr.  Priestley is entitled to his warmest
gratitude; and when we consider the great multitude of subjects
connected with science which have derived advantage from the labours
of Dr. Priestley, I think we may consider his name as reflecting honour
upon our country, as holding out a bright example for the imitation
of posterity, and as fully justifying the enthusiasm which I rejoice to
see animates this assembly.
   “Prosperity to the British Museum” having been associated with
the health of J. G. Children, Esq., Honorary Secretary to the Com
 mittee by whom the preliminary measures for the Commemoration
 had been conducted, Mr. CHILDREN addressed the meeting nearly in
 the following words:—
     Iam not exactly aware what immediate connexion there is between
 the British Museum and Dr. Priestley, except that his volumes form
 one of the greatest ornaments of our library.      I beg leave, however,
 to return  my  thanks for the honour    you have done the Trustees and
 Officers of that establishment, and for the compliment you have paid
 to me, as Honorary Secretary on the present gratifying occasion.
 The labours of that office, which I am highly delighted in filling, have,
 through the kindness of many gentlemen interested in this meeting,
 (especially Mr. Taylor,) been of the lightest kind; but were it pos
 sible that such duties could have been irksome, your approbation
would be ample compensation.         But I must not omit this opportunity
 of paying  my  tribute of respect to the memory of the Philosopher, the
hundredth    anniversary   of whose birth we are this day assembled to
 celebrate.   My    honourable friends who have already addressed you,
have alluded with equal ability and eloquence to a variety of sub
jects to which the labours of Dr. Priestley were directed.              Ibeg
leave to call  your  attention to those which he devoted to      electricity.
A science so abounding in brilliant phaenomena could not fail to ex
cite the strongest emotions in a mind like that of Priestley: who not
only fully appreciated the importance of the discoveries already made,
but with an almost prophetic spirit seems to have anticipated still
more important results reserved for a future period.      I will not under
take to quote his exact words,--but, in the History of Electricity
which has been justly eulogized by Mr. Taylor, and it is impossible
to conceive a more valuable history, one more perfect in        itsarrange
ment, more minute, and yet not tedious,        inthat work    he says,  “By
pursuing this new light, the bounds      of natural science  may    possibly
be   extended beyond what we can now form            an
                                                     idea of: new worlds
may open       our view, and the discoveries
          all to

self and      his cotemporaries    be eclipsed   bythe labours     of   new
                                                                        a

            of the Centenary of the Birth of Dr. Priestley.                                            399
set  of philosophers in this new field of speculation.” And he adds a
little further: “What delight would it afford to a modern electrician,
to exhibit, were the thing possible, some of his principal experiments
to Sir Isaac Newton'." And here I may be allowed to ask, If in the
estimation of Dr. Priestley, it would have excited admiration in the
 mind of Newton to witness the powers of the Leyden phial, or the
 repetition of Franklin's daring experiment, what would he himself
 feel at the progress which his darling science has made in later times?
 With what ardour would he behold the electric fluid deprived of its
 fugacious and impetuous character, and rendered the obedient servant
 of our will by the sagacity of a Volta' How would he rejoice to see
 the strong analogies that exist between Electricity and Magnetism,
 extended and confirmed by the discoveries of CErsted —and, finally,
 if not their identity, yet (as has been well expressed in a very recent
 work,) that they are merely “different aspects of the same agent,”
 proved, beyond dispute, by the incomparable researches of our own
 highly gifted countryman [Mr. Faraday], the second “child and
 champion” of that noble Institution in whose bosom and at whose
 hand a Davy found that protection and assistance which enabled him
 to triumph over the most energetic attractions of matter, to disarm
 the fire-damp of its terrors; and, in a word, to raise an imperish
 able monument to his own and his country's glory ! But to return
 to Priestley:-I shall not enter into a detail of
                                                                   of all
                                                         that     accomplished        he
in  the   science;  but two   happy   applications       electrical agency                                 to

 Priestley did not himself pursue the path            marked out            full                to   its

 400                Addresses delivered at the Commemoration
 In reverting to Dr. Priestley, allow           me to say that it was he who, in
  the early  period   of  my   life,  brought     me to consider the nature and
  the properties of the gases.            It was from him, from reading his
 books, that I first formed the apparatus and the arrangement of my
  own laboratory.        I was delighted with the simplicity of his appa
 ratus, because I found in it so much facility and assistance. If I
  wanted hydrogen, or oxygen, or any one of the forms of gas that
 are useful in the laboratory, by Dr. Priestley's apparatus I was put in
 possession of            will always occur
                           it.   It                  any mind that loves scienceto
 that certain   improvements         may      brought   forward      bearrangement;                   in
 but the   simplicity       Dr.   Priestley's
                                      of        laboratory   engaged    the attention
     all. His pneumatic trough, his arrangements for the preparation
 of of
     every gas that       could speak of, were simplicity itself.
                                 I                                                true                             It   is

   Gentlemen,      canI truly say that this      the happiest day        my      is                                    of

           of the Centenary of the Birth of Dr. Priestley.           401
tender to you my thanks for the honour you have conferred upon
his memory.       His career was, in some respects, that of every person
connected with science.      In his youth he had to struggle with many
difficulties.   In his advanced age his love for science was more ad
mired, for science itself was more appreciated. In the United States
of America I have seen the mansion in which his life rolled peacefully
on. There he would have been perfectly happy, if he could have as
sembled around him some of the friends of the former years of his
life, whose society would have delighted him.            I
                                                      If might be per
mitted, without presuming too much on the indugence of the meeting,
to propose a toast, I would give that of one of his first friends. I am
sure that, in an assembly of Englishmen, the name of Franklin cannot
be mentioned without his being regarded as one of the most distin
    ished discoverers in science.

    The meeting was     addressed, in conclusion of  the Proceedings, by
J.   A. PARIs, M.D. F.R.S.
    After what you have heard this evening, and which has thrown a
delightful degree of interest around the meeting, I should not have
risen did I not feel that you have yet an important duty to perform,
which is to drink the health of our worthy friend the President.
    Allow me to make a few observations on the object of this festival.
 It has been said that a man is no prophet in his own country. I will
 go further, and say that a man is no philosopher in his own time,
 and for this obvious reason—that it is the character of a genius to
 anticipate the age in which he lives. He sees by a species of mental
 refraction the great light of truth, which is as yet below the horizon.
 We can revert to the works of our departed philosopher for an illus
 tration; since it is only lately that we have been able to appreciate
 the utility of those applications to which his discoveries have been
 subservient. This leads me to the relation of one simple fact. If
 gentlemen will refer to the first Bakerian lecture delivered by Sir
 Humphry Davy, they will see that, without the assistance of Dr.
 Priestley, he could not have arrived, at least so speedily, at those re
 sults which have crowned his memory with lasting honours. At this
 late period of the evening I will not enter into any chemical discus
 sion, but will merely state to what I refer. It was well known that
 water under the influence of voltaic action gives out indications of
  alkaline and acid matter. It was obvious to Sir Humphry Davy, that
  the presence of this alkaline and acid matter must have been derived
  from some foreign ingredient, although Sylvester assumed that the
  matters in question were actually generated.      By a series of experi
  ments, unequalled in beauty, Sir Humphry Davy convinced himself
  that some foreign matter must have interfered; but he was at a loss
  to understand how the production of alkaline matter at a certain
  stage of the process was stationary, while that of the acid matter was
  progressive: and it was only by reference to the experiments of Dr.
  Priestley that he was enabled to clear up this doubt and difficulty.

     HE   names of the following plants I have received from
      my scientific friend the Chevalier Schousboe, Consul
General for Denmark, at this place (Tangier), who has been
for many years known by his writings to the botanical world.
    1. Passerina hirsuta, Linn. : found in the fields near            La
raiche, upon the western coast.
   2. Narcissus Bulbocodium, Linn.: from the Atlas mountains.
          I
Of this add a dozen bulbs, in hopes that some one may be
made to grow.
    3. Artemisia: from near to the Atlas range. The name
of this plant is pronounced by the Arabs of Marocco Shachi.
I  endeavour to show the sounds as nearly as possible accord
ing to the pronunciation of an educated Englishman.               It is to
the want of travellers     having    stated  distinctly  the pronuncia
tion to which their use of the letters they employ in strange
proper names is to be referred, that we may ascribe much con
fusion in ancient and modern history and geography; and
some also,    I doubt not, in other sciences.         This plant Shach
   • Read before the  Horticultural Society May 17, 1831; and now    com
municated  by  the Council of that Society.
   + The a is to be pronounced like the a in our participle made.

     Since writing my letter,               I      have perused again the whole
passage on the subject           in Pliny, and am much struck with this
sentence:—“Ancorarius        mons vocatur citerioris Mauretaniae,
qui laudatissimam dedit citrum, jam exhaustus.”
   Knowing how much the Latins, as the Greeks their prede
cessors in this careless custom, corrupted the proper names
found in tongues foreign to their own, I am disposed to think
that the etymon of this Latinized term Ancorarius may be found
in the name of a stream and valley, called by the present                                        in

intelligent mountaineer in my service, who is a native of the

which much fine timber is brought, not only from Reef, but

        a saturated solution of iodine in alcohol is poured
WHEN
  into hot nitric acid in a large flask, a violent action takes
place with evolution of mitric aether, acetic acid and deutoxide
of azote; and the colour of the iodic solution disappears.                                                If
the heat be kept up, and iodine in a solid state be gradually
added as long as the action takes place, and the colour disap
pears, there is deposited on cooling a transparent yellowish
oily-looking fluid, heavier than water, and possessing the fol
lowing properties:–
    1. It has a strong penetrating odour, very different from
that of the hydriodic aether of Gay-Lussac, and a sharp burn
ing taste, the effect of which remains upon the tongue for a
considerable time.
   2. When free from excess of iodine it is of a very pale
yellow colour; a slight heat, however, discolours it by causing
partial decomposition.
    3. It is not easily inflammable. It cannot be volatilized
 without decomposition. The heat and light of the sun decom
 pose it in close vessels; it becomes coloured and deposits iodine
 in regular crystals.      Kept     contact with the acid liquid

for several days, and a little more iodine added as the colour
slowly disappears.         The addition of a little sulphuric aether
 will at any time by agitation give a solution of the iodic in com
mon aether, which floating on the top may easily be separated.
    The supernatant acid liquid in the first process contains a
large quantity of iodine in solution, partly in the state of aether,
partly, probably, as Faraday's iodide of aetherine, and partly
as Serullas's periodide of carbon.        The aether is not wholly
separated by subsidence on cooling; a further portion is thrown
down by the addition of water, and a second portion by satu
 ration with an alkali, though in both cases slightly coloured.
 Agitation with sulphuric aether separates it most completely.
 Saturated with soda the supernatant liquid becomes dark co
 loured, and by evaporation may be brought to a treacly con
sistence, but does not crystallize.      The dark colour is not due
alone to free      iodine,  for it does not disappear by long ex
posure to the air, nor by heating, but to carbon, which exists
either in a peculiar state of combination with iodine, or as
ulmic or azulmic acid.         By evaporation to a syrup, and sub
sequent dilution with cold water, a carbonaceous matter is se
parated, which is soluble in hot water, and in solution throws
down a yellow iodide from the salts of lead. Alcohol does
not separate the iodine from this carbonaceous matter, but it
may be driven off by the heat of a spirit-lamp, leaving a spongy
charcoal.
    When the acid liquid is diluted and supersaturated with
ammonia a yellow precipitate falls, which is chiefly Serullas's
periodide of carbon. This compound is sometimes obtained
also on decomposing the aether by dry caustic potash.           Nitric
acid throws down iodine from the filtered ammoniacal solu
tion, and by evaporation it becomes dark coloured as above
stated. The saturated supernatant liquid does not precipitate
chloride of barium.
    What is the true constitution of this interesting compound,
it is difficult to decide.     From the mode in which it is formed
by the aid of nitric acid we should be led to infer the presence
of oxygen; while, on the other hand,           properties and the ab

and predicting new phaenomena?                  This principle has been
recognised by every philosopher, and is tacitly acted upon in
every investigation which is going on in every other branch of
science.     Is optics to be excepted 2 Oram I to understand you
to say that Newton's and Biot's molecular theories will apply
to the explanation of phaenomena of various classes equally
well with the undulatory theory? If this is your meaning, the
onus probandi is upon you. It is certain that observations have
been calculated upon the undulatory theory, and have been
found to agree with the calculations, which have not been cal
culated on any other theory: it is certain that phaenomena have
been predicted from the undulatory theory, and have corre
sponded exactly to the prediction, which have not been pre
dicted from any other theory”.                If you intend that the sen
tence above      quoted   should be received literally, you are bound
to   point   out some steps at least of the calculation on other
theories.
    Nothing appears to me more prejudicial to the progress of
science than vague statements of such a kind as that to which
I  allude.     I   am desirous of avoiding this error, and              I  will
therefore point out several instances in which the two theories
that you have mentioned fail.
     Newton's theory of alternate states of easy reflexion and
easy transmission will not explain the jetty blackness of the
central spot in Newton's rings.              It will not explain the dila
tation of the     rings   on  increasing    the angle of incidence, with
out another       principle    (the  lengthening     of the fits), which is
negatived by every use made of light which has passed ob
liquely through glass. It will not plausibly explain Grimaldi’s
fringes, and fails totally for the fringes produced by narrow
openings. It will not in the slightest degree explain the fringes,
&c. in the shadows of bodies of different forms.                   It will not
explain the interference-bars produced by two mirrorst. . It
will not explain the spectra formed in telescopes by Fraunho
fer's gratings.
    Biot's theory of moveable polarization will not explain the
ordinary polarized rings of Iceland spar, in different positions
   * As a simple instance of calculation, I may point out the polarized rings
of Iceland spar, in different positions of the analysing plate; and as a simple
instance of prediction, the   change in the character of Newton's rings at a
certain angle of incidence, when the lower plate is metallic and polarized
light is used. Perhaps the most remarkable prediction that has ever been
made, is that lately made by Professor Hamilton. [See present vol. p. 112
and 207.-EDIT.]                          -
   t  In some place, to which I am at present unable to refer, I have seen
a hypothesis to account for the destructive interference of light on a theory
of emission.    I envy the imagination of any one who can form such a con

               “On         the Absorption           of Specific Rays, &c.”                          421
of the analysing plate. It will not explain the rings produced
with Iceland spar with circularly polarized light.           It is unable
even to express the nature of circularly and elliptically po
larized light. It will not explain the phaenomena of quartz. It
will not explain the rings of biaxal crystals with plane or circu
larly polarized light, in different positions of the analysing plate.
   The phaenomena which have mentioned have I                   been cal               all
culated     onthe undulatory theory, and they agree perfectly
with the deductions from that theory: these calculations more
over are       all   to to
                      found     print. in  They are also phaenomena
which   ought        be be

                                       the theories above mentioned
if those theories possess any value.          They are, therefore,                                      as

422     Prof. Airy's Remarks on Sir David Brewster's Paper
     You mention, and justly, that        the undulatory theory is de
fective as a
I
               physical   representation    of the phaenomena of light.
   imagine that any theory must be defective in this point.                                                  §.
is the undulatory theory more or less defective than the mole
cular theory? To assist in forming an answer to this question,
I  will point out two or three facts. The theory of undula
tions explains well the reflexion at the surfaces of transparent
media; which Newton's theory can hardly be strained to ex
plain.     With certain assumptions, it gives laws for the inten
sity of the reflected light, which your subsequent experiments
on the position of the plane of polarization have confirmed; no
one has even conceived how such a calculation could be com
menced on the molecular theory.                It explains the relation
(discovered by you) between the polarizing angle and the re
fractive index; an explanation perfectly inconceivable on the
molecular theory.         It explains with less certainty the elliptic
polarization at total internal reflexion, and it does not at                                                  all
explain the elliptic polarization           metallic reflexion; but the
             theory                        give             to at                          of

solution   of the question will depend upon our determining whe
ther   absorption  must necessarily enter into theory               light.      a               of

                    “On    the Absorption   of Specific Rays, &c.”            423
      I
      do not think that absorption is to be considered a neces
 sary part of the theory. It is a sort of extraneous interruption
 which either leaves the ordinary laws in full vigour, or wholly
 destroys, not the laws, but that which is the subject of the laws.
 Reflexion, refraction, interference, double refraction, polari
 zation, go on with absorption just as if there were no such
 thing in nature.    The supposition of undulation by transver
 sal vibration, the principle  of superposition of small vibrations,
 the  assumption   that the velocity  is different in different media,
are necessary in every investigation; the suppositions (what
ever they are,) that are to account for absorption are necessary
only now and then.       The former suppositions, in the vast ma
jority of instances, do not require the latter; the latter when
wanted must be combined with the former.            These considera
tions seem to point out clearly that absorption requires a sup
plementary theory; and our only care with optical theories at
present must be, that our present assumptions may admit of
such a supplement at some future time. As far as can judge,       I
either theory (emission or undulation) seems likely to admit of
such a supplement, and              I
                               do not see that one will admit of it
more easily than the other.
    A remarkable instance of the same kind has already oc
curred in the history of optics. When Fresnel's theory and
measures of diffraction had given a very high probability to the
undulatory theory, there still remained, to be accounted for,
the laws of polarization and the connexion between polariza
tion and double refraction. The undulatory theory was there
fore generally adopted, leaving the kind of vibration to be deter
mined by the consideration of accounting in the best manner
for these remaining phaenomena.            The success with which
this was afterwards      done,  by  the  assumption    of transversal
vibrations, exceeds anything that has been gained in philoso
phy since the establishment of the theory of universal gravita
tion.    Had Fresnel proceeded as you (apparently) would wish
us to  proceed,  the undulatory theory would not now have ex
isted.
   Every other branch of philosophy presents instances similar
to the last.         If,
                   for instance,        at
                                   the time     inquiring into the
                                                        of
mutual action            of
                    bodies on each  other, Newton had insisted
 on including     his general theory (whatever
                     in                            might be,) the

leaving these       subjects for future investigators, and
                         as                                    re     he by
ducing      law the preponderating set

                                            phaenomena,       was
able     form the most complete cosmical theory that has ever
          to
appeared. Many years passed before those supplementary

424.        Prof. Powell's Remarks on Mr. Barton's Paper
laws were reduced to a simple form; yet by the consent of
the world, the theory of gravitation, though imperfect as a
theory of attraction, though sometimes completely disguised
by the forces which Newton left unexplained, was adopted as
a true system. That the existing theory of undulations stands
in the same relation to the complete theory of light as New
ton's universal gravitation to the complete theory of attrac
tions, I have not the slightest doubt.
   With regard to the importance, as a difficulty, of the num
ber of interruptions in the spectrum produced by nitrous gas,
I do not entirely agree with you.                           If
                                        a plausible reason can be
found, on either theory, for a single interruption,        have no                     I
doubt that good conjectural reasons will very soon be found
for a thousand interruptions.      And with regard to the atten
tion  which,   in shaping  an  optical theory, these interruptions
at  present   deserve, I may  perhaps   not quite agree with you.
 They are not yet disciplined under laws: they stand a mere
 “mob of facts;” and no one can tell what they seem to indi
cate.   But every attention ought to be given to reduce them
to rules;   and the apparent uniformity of the lines of nitrous
gas, at least as compared with the solar lines or the interrup
tions by different kinds of glass, seem to make it probable that
this beautiful and important discovery (setting apart        prac                           its
tical uses,) may assist       discovering the laws which govern
                                     us   in
the most obscure and most difficult part       optics. The theory of
of  crystalline absorption cannot then,        think, remain longI
without   explanation.    With sincere   respect,   remain,              I

     This calculation  is not carried to any great accuracy; but
it will suffice to show that even without affecting the value of
(b) (which is open to much uncertainty), the differences are
fairly within the limits of error. We might proceed to calcu
late the errors in (b), or to estimate their joint effect; but what
is here given,           is,

    Let   us next suppose the aperture wider, such, for example,
that, agreeably to the above remarks, we may have for the

    Thus it will be apparent, even without taking the trouble
of   calculating further, that these results of theory give an ex
act representation of the effects actually observed.              The centre
is in either case a maximum, or point of relative brightness
compared with other parts of the screen.                    When the aper
ture is    extremely   narrow the whole          intensity  is very small, or
 the   image   extremely      dull,  or even almost      totally dark, which
is precisely the character of the coalescing shadows: when
slightly wider, the increase of light is considerable, the centre
 being the brightest, but the variation towards the sides but
 small: when of considerable width (within a certain limit), the
    *.<U+017F>º
 centre is still a maximum, the increase in the absolute inten
 sity.         and the variation from the centre to the edge more
 Itaplol.
           difference in the representation given in Mr. Barton's
 diagram, from my observations, may possibly be no more than
 arises from the imperfect nature of the sketch, or of the en
 graving; and it may not have been intended to convey the
 idea of bright fringes continued at the sides, or of the centre as
 absolutely dark; but however this may be, it is obviously an
 essential point; and Mr. Barton will, perhaps, in a future com
 munication, be able to state it more explicitly.
                           I
     Upon the whole cannot but consider the theory of optics
 as under obligation to Mr. Barton for having brought forward
 several objections to the undulatory system; which are cer

tainly of a nature deserving the most attentive examination,
and supported by good computations of the theoretical results,
altogether evincing much research and skill.    If have been                        I
compelled to differ from him as to the comparison instituted
with earlier experiments, and in the actual results observed in
the last case, I hope that he will regard these remarks in no
other light than as conspiring with his own researches in the
common cause of scientific truth.
     P.S.–In   immediate connexion with the foregoing remarks,
I  have now to add, that I have received from Prof. Airy the
following statement relative to these experiments; and I gladly
avail myself of his permission to lay it before the readers of
this Journal.
     “I  have repeated several times Newton's experiment on
knife-edges, placed at a very small distance apart. As my ob
ject was to verify Newton's observations, and to verify Fresnel's
theory, as far as calculations can be applied, carefully avoided         I
the use of curved edges, which introduce insurmountable dif
ficulties into the mathematical investigation. , My aperture
was made by two rectilinear cheeks, adjustible by a screw.
The edges of the cheeks are very truly worked.               have tried            I
holes for admitting the sun's light into the room, of various
breadths, from about 3 inch (which was the breadth of New
ton's hole in this experiment,) downwards. The aperture be
tween the cheeks has in general been varied through                  the                     all
values between             tº

                 estimation).     My distances from the hole the                             to

   Newton's measures of the distances at which the first black
bar is formed appear to be bad. According to theory, when
the breadth of the aperture is very small, the distance should
vary as the square of the breadth. This proportion is very
closely preserved in Biot's experiments with very narrow aper
tures, but is not at                all

    In the next set of experiments, a suspending spring was em
ployed, which was thinned so much as to be just sufficient to
 bear the weight of the pendulum.              This was done as a pre
paratory step, previous to determining an extent of vibration,
such that the amount of the increase of vibration in vacuo
would be equivalent to the amount of the loss occasioned by
the current generated in air. A cylindrical bob, of 8 pounds
weight and 2 inches diameter, was first employed, which, it
was supposed, would have nearly the same momentum or spe
cific gravity, as the common mercurial pendulum with                   glass                     its

    For the experiments in Nos. 11 and 12, it was necessary that
 the pallets should be of a peculiar shape.                   It was formerly
 stated that they were ground hollow in the flanches for the
 purpose of giving the impulse in descent.                 The pallets were
 sufficiently broad to admit of two separate actions of the wheel;
 one half of the thickness of each, on the same side, was ground
 flat in the way usually done for a dead scapement.                  It was also
 stated that the pallets were jointed concentrically on the axis.
 The central brass collet or socket on which they were jointed,
 was fixed to the arbor by a pinching screw. By this means,
 the pallets could be moved along the arbor, and thus the ac
 tion of the wheel could be shifted from the one to the other
 at pleasure, and the wheel could also be put out of action al
 together, if required.          In order to give the whole impulse in
 ascent, the pallets required to be pitched deeper in the wheel
 than usual; and in order to clear the teeth properly, they re
 quired to be made thinner or shorter in the flanches; this
 caused a corresponding loss of power.
     The portion of the pallets which was employed to give the
 impulse in descent, was a little deeper or thicker than the
 portion used to give the impulse in ascent.                By this means, a
 greater impulse was given in the former case than in the latter;
 and thus the greater extent of vibration in the experiments of

   of minute        Forces on the Rate                     of the Seconds Pendulum.               439
No. 12, as compared with those of No. 11, is accounted for.
If 1.5 second be allowed for the difference in the extents of
vibration, and if to this the 1 second actually shown by expe
riment be added, the amount 2.5 seconds will be the difference
between the two methods,-the one of giving the whole of the
impulse in ascent, and the other of giving three fourths of it
in descent.
   When the pendulum was suspended                                 by a strong adjusted
spring, there was no less than 5                           seconds of difference between
the results of the two methods.
  In   consequence  of this alteration on the pallets, the pendu
lum had been    lengthened  so as to produce a difference of 4 or
5 seconds in 24 hours, which accounts for so great a difference
in time as that shown between the experiments of Nos.10 & 11.

impulse being given equally in ascent and descent.

   This property which the bicarbonate of                          potassa possesses
of decomposing  the phosphates, is only available in qualitative
examinations; as the conversion into carbonate is only partial.
The use of the salts of lead in freeing the earths from phos
phoric acid requires much time and attention; whereas the
process here recommended,     occupies but a few minutes, and
though not so complete in                 its
                                 effects, answers completely                           to

LXXIV.                 On the Modulus              of Elasticity of Gold. By B. BEVAN,

ITticity
    is something remarkable that while the modulus of elas
         and stiffness of number of the common metals have
                                             a
been investigated and determined, that of gold, which is con
sidered the most valuable metal, should have been neglected,
or overlooked. To supply this defect have lately obtained a         I
piece of pure gold, and have ascertained the measure of                                                   its
elastic force       about 11,690,000 pounds

about   1,000,000   feet lower than the modulus          platinum, and                of
5,000,000 feet less than that           plate-glass.   of suspect, how               I

  With this magnetic force, and                      the assistance            of    a    galvano
meter which multiplied the electric force more than fifty times,
“a permanent deflection of the needle of nearly 45° could be
sustained.”
   With my simple electrical machine, excited by a magnet of
about three pounds weight only, and a needle, supported on
a pivot, either above or below the edge of the revolving disc,
a permanent deflection of more than 40° can be exhibited.
And when two such magnets are employed, as in fig. 10, the
needle may be kept steadily deflected at right angles to the
plane of the disc.
   From this simple statement of facts, we readily perceive
that the apparatus of Mr. Faraday exhibits but a very small
portion indeed of the excited force in the disc, and leaves in
complete obscurity the finest application of that force ever ex
hibited on the magnetic needle.
   The electric force which may be led or conducted by a wire
from a revolving disc may be very much exalted by taking
advantage of the distribution accomplished by the arrange
ment of magnets exhibited in the following experiment.
   Experiment 23.—Let the disc revolve between the poles of
two horse-shoe magnets, having both the north poles on one
side, and consequently both the south poles on the other side
of the disc, as in fig. 11. (Plate             this case the four sy

450    Mr. W. Sturgeon      on the Theory   of Magnetic Electricity.
discs,  however, can drive off through wires the whole force
excited.
   Cylinders properly mounted, with respect to the exciting
magnetic lines, offer a much more efficient apparatus than discs
for driving a continuous current through conducting wires.
I have made some apparatus upon this principle, but must de
fer the description till another opportunity.
    When a sudden and momentary current is to be exhibited,
no mode of excitation hitherto discovered can be employed
with greater advantage than that of suddenly making and anni
hilating a temporary magnet of soft iron, inclosed in a spiral of
copper wire, a mode which I believe was first introduced
by Mr. Faraday in some of his experiments for deflecting the
magnetic needle; and which, in the experiments of M. Nobili,
and afterwards, in this country, in those of Mr. Saxton and
Mr. Forbes, has been so successfully employed in exhibiting
the electric spark.
   By this mode of excitation the whole of the exciting polar
magnetic lines are called forth simultaneously, and with a ve
locity not easily accomplished any other way; and in directions
the most suitable to produce the greatest effect.
   I  have only to add in this place, that whatever claims may
have been made by others to the first discoveries of this branch
             I
of science, apprehend that the experiments and explanations
hitherto produced in this series of communications can leave
very little difficulty in placing those discoveries in the proper
quarter.     My vibrating disc (Phil. Mag, and Annals, N.S.
vol. xi. Plate  III.  fig. 3.) has, I perceive, already been recog
nised as the first instrument which exhibited phaenomena
which could not be reconciled to the hypothesis advanced
upon the experiments of Arago.             And my rotating disc is
not  only  the first “machine” of this class that was ever made,
but is at this time the most efficient of its kind. The deflec
tions of the needle exhibited by the former apparatus led to
the construction and employment of the latter. And although
I  did not, in my first communication, advance a direct asser
tion that the excited force in the discs was the electric; my
statements, to say the least of them, were favourable to the
supposition,-perhaps as much so, as the nature and results of
º    experiments, and a due regard to propriety, would permit.
   y drawings, however, amply testify that my real views of the
character of the force were perfectly correct.         It is however
due to other    experimenters     that I should  state,  that I never
employed wires in my experiments in magnetic electricity until
I  heard of them being employed by Mr. Faraday. And the

         Prof. Airy's Repetitions of Mr. Potter's Experiment. 451
first time that I witnessed the electric spark by magnetic ex
citation, it was shown to me by Mr. Watkins, in his shop at
Charing-cross, some considerable time after it had been shown
in London by Mr. Saxton, with a similar apparatus.

    of interposing a Prism in the Path of Interfering Light. By
    Professor         AIRy”.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
I   HAVE lately had several opportunities of repeating, under
     favourable circumstances, Mr. Potter's experiment of in
terposing a prism in the path of interfering light, and am able
to assert positively, as an experimental fact, that the gradual
displacement and ultimate disappearance of the centre of the
fringes take place in the manner which I stated as a conse
quence of theory; namely, that on receding from the prism,
the fringes remain stationary; while their character changes, in
such a manner, that the centre of fringes passes gradually and
rapidly from the centre of the mixture of lights to              border.                  its
   The    apparatus     which     have used consists

LXXVII.            Remarks upon an Optical Phaenomenon, seen in Swit–-
              zerland.  By H. F. TALBor, Esq. M.P. F.R.S.*
IN(page
    the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for November
         332) is an account, by Professor Necker, of a pretty
optical phaenomenon,                          seen in Switzerland, when the sun rises
from behind distant trees standing on the summit of a moun
tain.   The Professor adds, that he is surprised it has never
been noticed before.
     Iam happy to be able to bear testimony to the accuracy of
his description  of this phaenomenon, having observed it myself
with great attention in the summer of 1823, with the view of
discovering              its
                 cause. The place         my observation was   of

   To give any account of so detailed a history of the recent pro
gress of Astronomy as that contained in this Report, is impracti
cable; but we shall extract a few passages which possess peculiar
interest.   The Cambridge Observatory, it appears, is devoted espe
cially to the observation of the planets: on this subject Prof. Airy
informs us, that
     “A vast number of observations of planets is to be found in the Trans
actions, the Ephemerides, and the astronomical periodicals.       Their object
however is generally rather confined. The inferior planets are little ob
served: the superior, little except at opposition.    At the regular observa
tories they  have been much   neglected.    In the Berliner Jahrbuch 1816, it
is remarked that in two years there were only six observations of planets at
Greenwich.     The foreign observations are sometimes given without any
comparison: sometimes however (especially in the Milan Ephemeris,) they
are compared with the Tables, and even the equations of condition for cor
recting the elements are formed (as in Milan Eph. 1822).       In reflecting on
these circumstances, it appeared to me desirable that one set of good in
struments should be devoted to the observation of planets: and when the
Cambridge Observatory was put under my care, I determined on making
the planets my principal object.                 I
                                      hope in a few years to collect a mass of
observations directed to this point that will possess great value. I have al
ready obtained and compared with Tables about 1100 right ascensions of
planets, besides numerous observations of the sun and moon."

                               Professor Airy:

                            Second Report                    of the British Association.                                          459
    “Of pendulum experiments, the most valuable series is that made by
Captain Sabine in almost every practicable latitude. Invariable pendulums
which had been observed in London (to ascertain the number of vibrations
made per day,) were observed in the same manner at all the stations, and
again in the same manner on returning to London. In this manner, without
ascertaining the absolute force of gravity at any one place, the proportion at
different places is found probably with greater accuracy than by any other
method. This is the method commonly adopted by the English experimen
ters.     Experiments were previously made at several places in Britain by
Captain Kater; and others have been made in different parts of the world
by Captain Hall, Sir Thomas Brisbane, Mr. Goldingham, &c. A vast num
ber of most careful observations by Captain Foster, in his last voyage, has
been received in England, and is now (I believe) preparing for the press.
Advantage has also been taken of our repeated expeditions to the North
Seas to observe pendulums at high latitudes. The method commonly used
by the French philosophers was, to observe the absolute length of the se
conds pendulum at each station: thus they experimented at several stations
in France and Italy, in the Mediterranean, and in Britain.               An extensive
series, however, made in Freycinet's voyage, and a few in Duperrey's, were
made with invariable pendulums.           In the course of experiments for ascer
taining the absolute length of the seconds pendulum by a new method, Bes
sel found that the correction applied in         former experiments for the buoy

tional scientific character. I feel therefore that my Report would be incom
plete if I did not, in some degree, give means for answering the questions,
What has England contributed to the progress of Astronomy? and, How
have the knowledge and practice of Astronomy advanced generally in En
gºland 2
      I fear that the answer to the first of these questions will not be very
satisfactory.    While I allow that in some important parts of Astronomy we
have done much, I cannot conceal that in other parts, especially those which
cast a lustre on the conclusion of the last century, and those which are pe
culiarly distinctive of the present century, we have done nothing.
     “A  subject so complicated as Astronomy, may be divided in several dif
ferent ways, and thus different comparisons may be made as to the progress
of      its
        various parts.      shall here view the subject

leave the present state of the heavens also in obscurity, our own observations
have too generally been cast on the world unreduced, with a hope,        I sup
pose, that others would have the zeal to reduce them. The observations
that require only moderate instruments, with patience and zeal on the part
of the observer, as the discovery and observation of comets, and the obser
vation of the small planets, (which on the Continent have generally been
made with unmounted telescopes,) have been little attended to. Of the lat
ter, some observations by Mr. Groombridge, some at Greenwich, and a few
by myself, constitute, I believe, the whole amount.
    “I  will not deny that there are some exceptions to my general assertion,
and in one of these my hearers will anticipate me. I think that I can fix on
only two discoveries, the results of combined theory and observation, which
are original in the present century, and one of these belongs to an English
man. New planets and periodical comets had been discovered in the last
century; abstract theory of every kind and observations of almost every kind
had been produced : but the existence of a resisting medium was established
in this century by Encke, and the practical prediction of the phases of dou
ble stars is due to Sir John Herschel. Nor can I omit to mention Sir Thomas
Brisbane and Mr. Baily, and (for several investigations connected with the
physics of Astronomy,) Mr. Ivory, and lately Mr. Lubbock.       But after every
credit has been given to their labours, it will, I believe, be allowed that the
part in which England has contributed most to Astronomy, and which is
likely to be mentioned with greatest gratitude by future historians of the
science, is that in which she has contributed as a nation.
    “In proof of the justice of my second assertion, the following remarks
may be sufficient. Our instruments I conceive (though a German would not
allow it,) to be superior to those of any other nation. The observations at
 our observatories are conducted,     I imagine, with greater regularity and
 greater steadiness of plan than those of foreign observatories. This, indeed,
 is the character which gave (in some respects) preeminent value to the
 Greenwich observations of last century, and which makes those of the pre
 sent century highly valuable. In the reduction of these observations we
 begin to fall off. Though Dr. Brinkley has investigated from observations
 a new Table of refractions, and applied it to his own observations, yet Brad
 ley's Table, known twenty years since to be sensibly erroneous, is still the
 standing Table of refractions at Greenwich.     The discussion of the reduced
 observations has been, I think, confined absolutely to the proper motion of
 stars. On one or two occasions a number of observations of the moon have
 (by order of the Board of Longitude,) been compared with the then existing
 Tables, but not with a view of improving the Tables.       I have had occasion
 to mention the correction of the elements of the earth's orbit made by myself
 (from Greenwich observations), and the discovery, in consequence, of a
 new equation in the perturbations of the Earth and Venus. As far as I have
 been able to ascertain, this was the first improvement in the solar Tables
 made by an Englishman since the time of Halley, and the first addition to
 the solar theory since the time of Newton.      From English observations of
 planets it has been impossible to extract a result, because scarcely any have
 been made.      To show the extent of this deficiency, I will mention a morti
 fying circumstance that has occurred to myself. In order to verify com
 pletely the equation above alluded to, I was desirous of collecting observa
 tions of Venus near her inferior conjunction.     In examining the Greenwich
 observations I found that no opportunity of making this observation was
  omitted by Bradley or his immediate successor Bliss; soon after the acces
  sion of Maskelyne it was wholly neglected; and from that time till several
  years after his death scarcely an observation is to be found: several con
 junctions have been passed over by the present Astronomer Royal; five

     462                   Reviews, and Notices respecting New Books.
   however have been completely observed.                  Under these circumstances,
   (though the deficiency for the latter part of the time only might be sup
   plied from scattered foreign observations,) considering how desirable it                                                                          is,

  prepared for the correction of the elements.            I suppose such a thing has
  never been done in England. This system must however contribute power
  fully to produce that strong connexion between physical theory and practi
  cal observation, which is general on the Continent, but which does not exist
  in England.

          believe that in the actual state of our institutions, reasons might be
  found which would seem to render it improbable that there ever can be so
  strong a connexion; and I can only hope that my view may be incorrect.
  There is one point with regard to the foreign astronomers to which I cannot
  help alluding, without however intending to draw any distinct inference. It
 of is,
       that they have first obtained distinction while          the lower departments       in

        Gentlemen,
     Twenty-five years only have elapsed since this Society was first
 formed under the auspices of Mr. Greenough and a few zealous na
 turalists.-In the year 1826, when your Charter was obtained, the
 number of Members had already reached 476, and since that period
 a still more rapid increase has taken place, which has now swelled our
list to 694. This remarkable yet steady augmentation of our forces
 is the best proof of the estimation in which your labours are held;
and it further shows, that the pursuits of the geologist are no longer
viewed as purely speculative, but are at length considered as essen
tially connected with the development of the national resources.
    The past Session has been fatally marked by the decease of three
distinguished geologists.
    The Rev. Benjamin Richardson, of Farley near Bath, one of the
earliest Members of this Society, was a man of great singleness of
character and generosity of disposition, and, as a cultivator of science,
he was distinguished by the extent of his knowledge,            not drawn.
from books, but from an examination of Nature in her own domains.
In the pursuit of geology he was well instructed from his own re
searches; but he was ever delighted to tell that he owed his first
clear ideas of the subject to William Smith; and his latter days were
gladdened by knowing that the merits of his friend had been ac
knowledged by this Society. To his generosity of disposition our
museum, and those of many local institutions, are deeply indebted.
He collected only that he might give away; and, regardless of               all
personal fame,   he  never failed, when      discovery was made,      to
                                                                       call
around him those who could profit      by    it. a
                                               Thus, though     he
                                                                 was never
seen among us, and though his name was rarely heard,       he  was steadily
labouring  in  our cause, and silently, but effectually, urging  iton.
I     have next the painful duty  to  record the death    of the venerable
Sir James Hall, one   of  that bright constellation  ofphilosophers which
                                         the last century.

  The intimate friend of Hutton and of Playfair,         he eagerly imbibed
the   opinions  of these celebrated     men,  and satisfied himself of the
leading truths in the Huttonian theory by extended and patient ex
aminations of geological phaenomena,-not merely amongst the British
Isles, but in the Alps, in Italy, and in Sicily. The result of these
observations was communicated in a series of Memoirs read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which distinguished body he was
for many years the President. In alluding to these Memoirs, I at
once remind you how materially he assisted in demonstrating that a
certain class of granitic veins had been injected into the overlying
deposits posterior to their consolidation.      He endeavoured to explain
experimentally the contortions of certain strata, and the manner in
which the phaenomena had been effected by upheaving forces acting
under compression.        He subjected various rocks of igneous origin
to chemical analysis, and succeeded in establishing their relative de
grees of fusibility.     He gave an original and perspicuous account of
the true mode of formation of volcanic cones; and whilst he pointed
out that Monte Somma was simply the segment of a vast volcano,
from the flank of which the present Vesuvius had arisen, he showed
the intimate analogy between the dykes of lava of the former and the
ancient trap-dykes of our continents.                                to If,

had thus divined the true cause of the phaenomena in dispute, that
great man shrunk from the prosecution of experiments which might
prove the truth of his hypothesis, being persuaded that the immensity
of natural objects was far beyond the reach of man's imitation. It
was reserved for Hall to have the glory of demonstrating the truth of
the doctrine of his friend ;-“the conjectures of genius,” as he tells
us, “at length ceased to appear extravagant; the mist which ob
scured the objects being dissipated by degrees, they appeared in their
true colours, and a distant prospect opened to his view of scenes be
fore unsuspected.” To his ardent mind the realization, upon the
surface of the earth, of that which had occurred below the deep abyss
of the ocean, was not a hopeless effort, and he commenced a series
of experiments which occupied a long period of his life, were con
ducted with undaunted perseverance, and with a surprising fertility of
invention, until he completely triumphed in fusing earthy carbonate
of lime under vast pressure, producing from it a pure and crystalline
marble. In establishing this fact, he turned the weapons of his oppo
ments against themselves,     and paved the way for the reception,
among       theall
                philosophers    Europe,    the leading doctrines which

    In attempting to account for the existence of large and shady
forests on spots where the coasts are now entirely shorn of vegetation,
we must embrace in our consideration the similar phaenomena which
are so numerous, as almost to form a submarine fringe around our
island; and from these we may conclude, that when the whole
country was densely clothed with wood, the forests might have ex
tended their limits in full vigour to marine tracts, where single trees
will no longer flourish.
    You were last year made acquainted with the existence, at various
places, of accumulations of sand, gravel, and clay, containing existing
species of marine shells, placed at different heights above the sea;
and a subsequent Memoir of Mr. Trimmer on a part of the estuary
of the Mersey describes the presence of fragments of shells of existing
species, in a stratum of sandy clay, containing numerous erratic
pebbles, and a few boulders.
    Having myself traced beds with recent sea-shells at considerable
and various heights above the sea, both on our eastern and western
coasts, I am disposed to think that there is already sufficient evidence
of our shores having undergone elevation at periods comparatively
recent, however difficult it may be to explain                                all
                                                                  such superficial
accumulations upon similar hypothesis.

being a second part of his former essay on the same subject. He                                                 in
dicates the localities in which the fragments of different rocks have
originated, showing that although some have been drifted from the
east, and others from the west, many of them are probably rem
nants of those calcareous mountains which were shattered on the
spot, at that period of dislocation, when by the expulsion of their
debris, that great cavity was formed, which is now occupied by the
lake. The superficial sediments of the basin are said to vary much
in their composition; whilst their beds are inclined in                directions,            all

upon a mass of zoological evidence infinitely more comprehensive, and
yet more precise than any which has ever been brought before us. In
treating chronologically of alluvial, fresh-water, marine, and volcanic
phaenomena, a wide range is afforded for the development of his exten
sive knowledge and observation; enabling him to ground his rea
sonings on countries visited by himself, and to interpret the hand
writing which Nature has left upon the walls of her geological monu
ments, in such a manner as not only to expound her ancient records,
but to connect them with the history of our present races.
   Although this volume is devoted chiefly to the description of the
younger formations, as more intimately connected with the main
object of the author, the secondary and primary rocks are reviewed
so far as was necessary to show their connexion with his theory,
and to indicate how well their structure can be accounted for by
causes, which he supposes to be still in full and undiminished opera
tion. The powerful effects produced upon the public mind by the
first and second volumes of this work will, I may venture to say, be
highly augmented by a perusal of this concluding part; and even
those geologists who may differ from the author on a few theoretical
points, will gladly eulogize the efforts of one who has so greatly ad
vanced their knowledge.
   FossIL Zoology.—The Session has been fertile in communications
upon fossil zoology. The splendid specimens of Megatherium, &c.
brought to this country by Mr. Woodbine Parish have, in the hands
of Mr. Clift, afforded us much curious instruction. The tribute which
these remains enabled Mr. Clift to pay to his great master in campa
rative anatomy, has already been adverted to; but we must not forget
that they also elicited brilliant lectures from Dr. Buckland, both within
these walls, and on the occasion of the late scientific festival at Oxford.
    The Rev. Mr. Stanley has given a lively description of the caves
of Cefn, in Flintshire, one of which, like that of Kirkdale, is supposed
to have been the inhabited den of hyaenas ; whilst another and larger
 cavern, situated at a lower level on the side of the same mountain,
 contained only the remains of recent animals. From the distinct
 nature of the upper and lower layers of alluvia collected within the
 inhabited cave, and arranged above and below the floor of fossil bones,
 the author speculates on layers as evidences of different periods of
 aqueous   debacle.
    Mr. Mantell,    whose energies seem to expand in each succeeding
 year, notwithstanding the limited field to which his researches are
 necessarily confined, has presented us with an account of an unde
 scribed and singular species of Saurian, to which he assigns the name
 of Hylaeosaurus.    This fortunate exhumation has, I am happy to say,
 encouraged the enterprising ranger of Tilgate Forest to make it the
 nucleus of a new and comprehensive work, in which he will not only
 describe all the vertebrated animals in his rich domain, the Wealds of
 Sussex, but will embrace in it a geological description of his own,
 and of the adjoining counties.
    The bright example of Mr. Mantell is meeting with worthy imitators
 in other parts of England, in the persons of other zealous young

    Fossil PLANTs.-The early experiments of Hall and Hatchett, am
plified and illustrated by MacCulloch, had nearly produced conviction
that all the varieties of carbonaceous matter, from the ill-consolidated
surturbrand, through every stage of brown coal to pure jet; and in our
older strata from anthracite to bituminous coal, were the products
of vegetables.      Botanists have since corroborated the soundness of
these views, by developing the Flora of the associated strata; and one
of our body has enabled us to refer many of these plants to their natural
families in living nature, by an ingenious method of exhibiting polished
sections of their stems: but it has been reserved to Mr. W. Hutton in
pursuing this line of inquiry, to complete the solution of the problem
by demonstrating the vegetable structure in coal itself. The Memoir
of Mr. W. Hutton is further of high and practical utility in describing
the source of those enormous volumes of imprisoned gases, which
upon admixture with our atmosphere become explosive, and occasion
such disastrous results to our miners.

 some part of their origin or course, or that of the muscles themselves.

  The Professors have for        time past held Monthly Evening
                                                some
Meetings in the Anatomical Museum of the University, and have
now made the addition, on the plan of the Royal Institution, of
having a lecture on some literary or scientific subject.  The first
lecture was given by Dr. Ritchie, On the communication of scien
tific knowledge to Youth, an outline of which will be found in the
April Number of this Journal, page 312. The second lecture, On
the Chemistry of Geology, was delivered by Dr. Turner on the 7th
of May.      We hope, in                 a future Number, to give an outline                         of this
lecture.
