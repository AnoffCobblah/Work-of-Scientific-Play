I.   The Ionizing Power of Solvents.               By W. C. DAMPIER

Tº
of
           exceptionally high power which water possesses of
       making many substances dissolved in it good conductors
    electricity  was noticed as soon as solutions in other liquids
began to be studied.         Even in cases where some conductivity
is produced, as in those of salts and acids dissolved in alcohol,
the electrical resistance is much greater than if water were
used as solvent.
    Now the dielectric constant of water is about 75, a number
greater than that of
                             ".    other substance which has been
examined, and it seems likely that there is a relation between
these two properties.        Thus   J. J.  Thomson f and W. Nernstf
have pointed out that the effect of immersing a system
formed of two oppositely electrified bodies in a medium of
high dielectric capacity is to diminish the attractive force
between the bodies. The result will be that the oppositely
charged ions, which we must suppose to make up a salt or
acid, can, under favourable circumstances, separate from each
other, and the number of molecules thus dissociated at any
instant, and therefore the conductivity, will depend on the
dielectric constant of the solvent.
    Several experimental investigations on the relative conduc
 tivities of substances when dissolved in different solvents have

2                Mr. W. C. Dampier Whetham                    on the
already  been carried out, and an attempt to connect such
results quantitatively with the dielectric constants has been
made by the present writer*. Since then further experi
ments have been made by Wöllmert on solutions in methyl
and ethyl alcohols, and he finds that the ratios of the conduc
tivities of various salts in water, methyl alcohol, and ethyl
alcohol are 100: 73: 34.     If we assume that the frictional
resistances which the three solvents oppose to the passage of
the ions through them are in the same ratios as their vis
cosities (a more or less plausible assumption for which there
is no experimental evidence), we can find relative values for
the ionizing powers by taking them to vary as the dielectric
constants and as the ionic fluidities.    The numbers for the
three   liquids come out as   100:63:26,    a rough agreement
with observation, which goes to show that we are probably
working somewhat in the right direction.
  The experiments now to be described were undertaken in
order to investigate the same idea by another method.             It
seemed   possible, if a liquid could be found of a suitable nature
and used as solvent, that water, used as solute, should itself
be ionized, and make a solution of high conductivity.
   A search for data on dielectric constants did not, however,
discover any liquid of higher constant than water.           Never
theless, it seemed likely that an examination of the conduc
tivities of mixtures of water and other liquids having various
constants would throw some light on the question at issue.
   In the choice of liquids for this purpose three things had
to be borne in mind.       Firstly, the substances must be liquid
at convenient temperatures and pressures; secondly, they
 must, when pure, have high specific resistances; and thirdly,
their dielectric constants must vary as much as possible.
The three acids—acetic, trichloracetic, and formic—were
finally selected. Many dielectric constants were determined
 by Thwing t, whose numbers for water, formic acid, and
 acetic acid are 75-5, 62-0, and 10-3 respectively.        The con
 stant for trichloracetic acid is not  given,  but from the numbers
 for aldehyde (1855), and chloral (5'47) it appears that the
 replacement of three hydrogen by three chlorine atoms lowers
 the dielectric constant considerably.        The value for trichlor
 acetic acid     is,
                 therefore, probably less than 10. Formic acid
 appears    to have    higher dielectric capacity than any liquid
                        a
    other than water which has yet been examined.
       The work was done       in
                            the summer     1896, but     of                its   publica

done in the course of a careful series of experiments by
Dr. Vladimir Novák, whose paper follows this one.
   As the object of the investigation was merely to test the
general behaviour of the mixtures, no great accuracy was
sought, and a simple form of apparatus was sufficient. Kohl
rausch's telephone method was adopted for the conductivity
measurements, a straight-wire bridge being arranged in the
usual manner.     Instead, however, of using a battery and
induction-coil as the source of current, the town supply,
alternating about 100 times a second, was sent through the
longer coil of a simple transformer, the shorter coil of thick
wire being connected with the bridge. This arrangement is
in constant use at the Cavendish Laboratory, and gives
excellent results, the sensitiveness being both greater and
more uniform than with the usual arrangement.
   Two cells were used to contain the solutions, one giving a
much higher resistance than the other.  Their forms are
represented in figs. 1 and 2. When in use each cell was

the cell became inconveniently large, the additions of water
were made in a separate vessel, into which the contents of the
cell were emptied after each electrical measurement.
    The electrical constants of the cells were determined by
filling them with solutions of barium chloride of known con
centrations, and measuring the resistances. The constants
were then calculated from Kohlrausch's determinations of the
conductivities        of these solutions.             Thus in cell No. 1 a
solution of 0.01 normal             strength     gave        a resistance of 2142
ohms at 18°, and a solution of 0-1 normal strength a resistance
of 251.5 ohms at 18°2. The constants calculated from these
numbers came out 2:307 x 10-" and 2:305 x 10-9 respectively,

  The numbers below the dotted line are calculated from Ostwald's
results for solutions of trichloracetic acid in water.
   Formic Acid and Water.—The formic acid sold as pure
had a freezing-point of +1°-60.                   On adding 0.5 c.c. of
water to 25.99 grams of acid it froze at –1°1, a lowering of
2°7, and a further addition of 0.5 c.c., making 1 c.c. in all,
gave a mixture freezing at —3°8.                  Thus the lowering pro
duced by the second half-gram of water was also 2°7, and
the depression of the freezing-point is proportional to the
quantity of water present.                   The freezing-point of the
anhydrous acid is taken by Raoult to be 8.5, so that the acid
used in these experiments contained about 2.47 per cent. of
water to begin with.             Allowing for this, and correcting the
conductivity results for the calculated conductivity of the
pure acid, we get:—

  The numbers below the dotted line are calculated                                      from     Ostwald's
results for solutions of formic acid in water.
    Ifwe plot these results as curves, showing the relation
between the percentage of water and the electrical con
ductivity, we get the diagrams represented in figs. 3, 4,
and 5.    It must be noticed that these curves are not
drawn on the same vertical scale.    The ascending branch
of each curve relates to a solution of water in the acid,
while the descending branch is concerned with a solution of
the acid in water. These latter solutions           give curves                  all                     of
the same general form, asymptotic           the vertical axis, and   to
this may         be
               considered     the typical curve  as    conducting                 of    a

for trichloracetic acid, which has        very much higher con     a
ductivity. The general form          the curve may thus   of  con                                 be

      The curve for water in formic acid, however, does not
 resemble these.      It                    is,

     by
     Dr. Novák’s much more elaborate experiments.             We have
 here, then,      form   a    curve which   of approaches   that                                   of   a
 typical electrolytic solution, though        does not quite coincide
                                                                  it

           it.                        we have seen, hasas    dielectric
              62,   of                  approaches          water,                    of a

 Could we find some liquid whose constant was greater than
 75,    seems probable that
          it                         would form    itsolvent     which      a                 in
 water would             be       an
                        electrolyte,  just    common mineral saltsas
 and acids are electrolytes when dissolved          water.                  in
    The forms of the curves indicate that the solutions of water
 in these three acids are not of the same nature              those of                  as

Electric Conductivities of Solutions of Water in Formic Acid.          9
normal electrolytic liquids. This difference is less marked in
the case of formic acid, but, even there, a true difference in
kind seems to exist, and it is probable that no true ionization
of the water occurs. In order to test this conclusion we may
make use of the freezing-point determinations which have
already been described.
    It  was found that 0.5 gram of water depressed the freezing
point of 25.99 grams of strong formic acid by 2°7.           This
quantity of water corresponds to 1:07 gram-molecule in
1000 grams of solvent, so that 1 gram-molecule in the same
weight of solvent would give a depression equal to 2°52.
On the assumption that there is no ionization, van’t Hoff's
formula gives 2°84 for this molecular depression, and Raoult's
experimental results for various organic substances dissolved
in formic acid vary from 2°6 to 2°9.          The phenomena of
the   freezing-points   thus confirm our previous conclusion that
water dissolved in formic acid is not ionized.
    Nevertheless, such a solution possesses considerable con
ducting power, of which an explanation is required.      Possibly
it is due to the distribution through the general non-conducting
or badly conducting mass of a small quantity of what may be
considered a solution of acid in the water which has been
added.      The curves, however, indicate that such a state is
essentially    different from that which holds in a normal
electrolytic solution.
    In conclusion we may say that there seems to be con
siderable evidence to show that, if a liquid could be found
possessing a dielectric constant higher than that of water, it
would, when used as a solvent, cause water dissolved in it to
be ionized, and give it a conductivity depending on the
amount of such ionization and on the ionic fluidity.         The
conductivity curve would then have the same general form as
those which we have seen to be typical of solutions of
electrolytes.

       of Beckmann's apparatus on a mercury thermometer
                         in Poº, corrections of which were
   Solutions of water in formic acid were prepared in a glass
                                                                                                               11
bottle (of 50 c.c.) with a glass stopper, by weighing the
bottle, then the bottle and the acid, and finally weighing the
whole, when some drops of water had been very carefully
added.
    I first tested
                 whether the formic acid, which is very hygro
scopic and easily decomposes, remained in a constant state
for the time (some hours) during which the observations of
the resistances and freezing-points were taken. The best way
to test this          is,
                  course,   of                       i.
                                                    by
                                measurement of the resistance
of the acid during some days.
    The following table (Table                                I.)   shows three such observations
for three different solutions, freezing      7-69, 5:46, 5-38                       at
respectively:-
  Every measurement started with        solution, which was                    a
prepared             by
               freezing; the second solution (5:46 f.-p.) was
left     the resistance-cell for the whole time (145 hours);
          in
the others were put immediately           the bottle after the             in
measurement.
   The conductivity increases during the time, more rapidly
the first day than afterwards, showing that the acid takes
some water from the air           that    decomposes slightly,or           it
especially       if contact with
                            in    platinum  black    the elec                                    on
trodes.
    More concentrated acid seems                more hygroscopic          to       be
 than dilute acid—the observations show that             as difficult                    it

 treatment took               in up
                         great deal   atime, because the greatest   of

    Fig.2 shows the dependence between specific conductivity
(c) and the temperature (t).         The first number for each
solution (put in brackets) is calculated for t = F.-P., supposing
the curves are straight lines, that being so at least for the
lower temperature.       The temperature-coefficient     “K” is
calculated for the first seven solutions from all the observa
tions, for the others only from the observations at the low
temperatures.
   The diagram (fig. 2) shows some very interesting results.

   The method adopted for the detection and measurement of
this motion was similar to that used by Professor Oliver
Lodge". Three small plane mirrors are placed vertically at
three corners of a square marked out on a rigid table. These
mirrors were mounted in such a way that, by the pressure of
screws behind, a slight rotation round a vertical or round a
horizontal axis could be given to each. The mirrors were
placed with their planes perpendicular to the diagonals of the
square.   At the fourth corner and with       plane     the dia         its              in

22       Messrs. Henderson and Henry on the Motion
decreasing the amount of reflected light and increasing that
of transmitted light. By this means we obtained in the field
of the telescope perfectly defined interference-bands, the
slightest motion of which could be at once detected.
   If now the aether can be made to move in the direction
of the transmitted beam, the increase thus caused in the
velocity of light in that direction and the corresponding
diminution of the velocity of light in the contrary direction
should alter the difference of phase between the beams on
arrival at the mirror a, and so produce a displacement of the
bands.
   To endeavour to produce this motion                 of the  aether  our
apparatus was arranged as follows:—Two                  condensers,   con
sisting each of two plates of sheet tin               (56 centim. x 39
centim.) separated by a glass plate (3 millim.        in thickness), were
laid horizontally side by side on paraffin             blocks on a table.
The bottom    plates  were connected to the terminals of the
secondary of a Ruhmkorff coil.              The upper plates were
joined through a circuit containing two spark-gaps—one
placed at the slit of the collimator so as to be the source of
light, while the other was situated at a distance of 4 centim.
from the edge of the mirror c and in the plane of the mirror.
   The primary plates of the condenser were also connected
through a spark-gap.        When these plates are raised to a high
potential by the coil they suddenly discharge themselves
through the spark-gap, thus causing the secondary plates to
discharge themselves through their connecting circuit with
its spark-gaps.

As R is increased, since                      Rºº, both                   factors in the index of
e in (ii.) increase, and therefore the amplitude diminishes.
    By introducing a resistance, therefore, into the circuit the
effects of second and succeeding oscillations may be rendered
negligible. In the secondary circuit of our condensers we
accordingly introduced a resistance which experiment showed
to be sufficient to fulfil this object.

an instrument somewhat similar to the above, except that the
wire was of iron instead of nickel.
   In order to show that the current induced in the coil is at
any rate chiefly due to variations in the magnetization of the
nickel wire produced by the variations of stress, and not to
the relative motion of the nickel wire and the coil, the follow
ing experiment was made       :-A    steel wire and a nickel wire
of the same dimensions were attached to similar wooden
diaphragms. These wires having been magnetized by stroking
them with a permanent magnet were in turn inserted into the
same solenoid and clamped as before at their lower ends. The
same watch telephone was used as a receiver with each.
The results obtained with the weakly magnetized nickel wire
were enormously better than those obtained with the strongly
magnetized steel wire.      If the induced currents were chiefly
due to the relative motion of the coil and magnetized wire
 the best results would have been obtained with the strongly
magnetized steel wire, since it can hardly be supposed that
the relative motions of the coil and magnetized wire differed
so much in the two cases as to cause such an enormous
difference in the results.
V.   On the Incidence  of Aerial and Electric Wares upon Small
    Obstacles in the form of Ellipsoids or Elliptic Cylinders,
    and on the Passage of Electric Waves through a circular
    Aperture in a Conducting Screen.         By Lord RAYLEIGH,
    F.R.S.*
          present paper may be regarded as a development of
THEprevious       researches by the author upon allied subjects.
When the character of the obstacle differs only infinitesimally
from that of the surrounding medium, a solution may be
obtained independently of the size and the form which it
presents.    But when this limitation is disregarded, when, for
example, in the case of aerial vibrations the obstacle is of
arbitrary compressibility and density, or in the case of electric
 vibrations when the dielectric constant and the permeability
are arbitrary, the solutions hitherto given are confined to the
case of small spheres, or circular cylinders.      In the present
investigation extension is made to ellipsoids, including flat
circular disks and thin blades.
    The results arrived at are limiting values, strictly applicable
only when the dimensions of the obstacles are infinitesimal,

This result corresponds with     m'<= c representing     absolute
incompressibility. The effect of finite compressibility, differing
from that of the surrounding medium, is readily inferred by
means of the pressure relation (8p = ms). The effect of the
variation of compressibility at the obstacle is to increase the
rate of introduction of fluid into T from what it would
otherwise be in the ratio m : m/; and thus (45) now becomes

   When the density of the obstacle (a') is the same as that
of the surrounding medium, (47) constitutes the complete
solution.    Otherwise the difference of densities causes an
interference with the flow of fluid, giving rise to a disturbance
of order 1 in spherical harmonics. This disturbance is inde
pendent of that already considered, and the flow in the
neighbourhood of the obstacle may be calculated as if the
fluid were incompressible.          We thus fall back upon the

the results will be applicable as soon as we have established
the correspondence between density and conductivity.
    In the present problem, if X denote the whole velocity
 potential, the               to be satisfied at any part of the
 surface of the obstacle are the continuity of dy/dn and of ox,
the latter of which represents the pressure.           Thus, if we
regard ax as the variable, the conditions are the continuity
of (ax) and of a 'd (ax)/dn. In the conductivity problem
the conditions to be satisfied by the potential (x) are the
 continuity of x' and of u dy'/dn.

 where a is constant, it makes no difference whether we are

            between the two problems provided that we suppose
the ratio of A's in the one problem to be the reciprocal of the
ratio of the a's in the other.
    We may now proceed to the calculation of the disturbance
 due to an obstacle, based upon the assumption that there is a
 region over which r is large compared with the linear dimen

importance so as to be comparable at a distance with the term
of the second order, although relatively negligible in the
neighbourhood of the obstacle.       The factor, analogous to
 –  k”,”e-ºr for the second order, is for the first order ikre-”,
and for zero order e-". Thus, although (101) gives the
value off with sufficient completeness for the neighbourhood
of the obstacle, (102) may need to be supplemented by terms
of the first and zero orders in spherical harmonics of the
same importance as itself.    The supplementary terms may be
obtained without much difficulty from those already arrived
at by means of the relations (93), (94), (95); but the process
is rather cumbrous, and it seems better to avail ourselves
of the forms deduced by Hertz" for electric vibrations
radiated from a centre.

   am   sorry
                     147 he   says of me : “showing

                     in fact, that he cannot even have read it.”
              that without just cause Prof. Reynolds should
disfigure a scientific discussion with an assertion such as the
                                                                          I

6 ft., but like the Leyden one with 14438 lines to the inch.
The second spectrum was very satisfactory.     For the cadmium
spectrum a spark was used between cadmium electrodes; with
a lens, as often used in this manner by Lockyer, an image of
spark and electrodes was formed on the slit; it is then easily
verified that the part of the spark just between the poles is
analysed.
   The above-mentioned cadmium line is especially sharp
at the violet side.

                             doublet along the lines of force a
perforated pole was used.       With a current of 30 amp., the
distance of the poles being as small as possible without
interfering with the cadmium electrodes, a perfectly defined
doublet was seen.      One of the components appeared to be
left-handed, the other right-handed circularly polarized f over
the whole width.    It might still be argued that the intervening
dark space between the components is caused by a reversal
and that it is not a doubling of the lines.      However, then it
must be   supposed   that this absorption-line just intercepts that
part of a magnetically broadened line emitting unpolarized

the dark space becomes narrower.        grant that this is also    I
the case with the supposed absorption-line.      However, then
a  greater  part of the broadened emission-line should emit
unpolarized light, the smaller absorption-line      now inter
cepting but a part of                     however, that even

of  the doublet were entirely circularly polarized, and hence

interpretation that the dark space is of the nature of an ab
sorption-band. Indeed, one should expect to see also reversal
if looking across the lines of force. However, in this direction
no trace of an ordinary absorption-line was visible with the same
magnetic intensity.     Hence we must conclude, I think, that
I  have
 theory.
          really observed the doublet indicated by Lorentz's
    10. Looking across the lines of force I succeeded in observing
the phenomenon indicated as triplet a (§ 6, diagram).        If no
nicol was used only a broadened line was visible, A nicol
oriented so as to get rid of light whose plane of polarization is
vertical makes a dark well-defined line appear in the midst of
the broadened line. Turning the nicol over 90° this dark line
disappears, the lateral wings now being quenched, because
these are polarized in a horizontal plane. All this is to be
expected according to § 6. The analysers in §§ 9 and 10
were inserted according to Lodge's " advice before the light

sodium.     As the D-lines reverse so very easily by non
magnetic agency and as they show sometimes complicated
phenomena (Lockyer and Ciamiciant), it seems difficult to see
the phenomena pure and simple with sodium.           It is true that
it is not difficult to avoid perturbations caused by the motion
of the piece of asbestos, as mentioned by Egoroff and
Georgiewsky f in their interesting note. To avoid disturb
ances of this kind I simply moistened the mouth-piece of the
burner with a very concentrated solution of NaCl or Na Br.
Small disturbances nevertheless easily make their appearance.
   12. Although my inquiry is not yet closed, I think, how
ever, that we can say that it seems to give new evidence in
favour of the interpretation of the magnetization of the spectral
lines given by Lorentz’s theory.        When          I
                                                  have determined
the  intensity  of my   field, we can decide the question   whether
we can hope to obtain a pure triplet by augmentation of the
magnetic force or by using narrower spectral lines, though,
of course, it may yet turn out that the phenomena prove to
be less simple.     For a future paper also must be reserved the
accurate measurement of the amount of the magnetic change

about the ratio between mass and charge of the ions in
Lorentz's theory.   It is very probable that these “ions”
differ from the electrolytical. º: is true that by means of

   Since each propagation is determined by a differential
equation of the same form as that which applies to a single
isolated conductor, such as is discussed in § 1, the action of Q
is equivalent to that of a pair of single conductors, and the
propagation along Q is the sum of the propagations along the
equivalent pair.
   Let the total resistances of the two equivalent cables be 27tr,
vrºeg   -
and 27try, and their capacities 27te, 27tes.
            1.

   Since the pair is electrically equivalent to Q, they must
convey the same steady current as Q, when subject to a
steady E.M.F., and must be charged to the same potential by
a given charge.    So    '+              and        ri<U+017F>  From   rj       +     r,                 c

             Mercury Films by an Electrical Process.                   75
  In    this way I have deposited mercury-films upon such
different substances as filter-paper, plaster-of-paris, Wood
bury-type-gelatine, porous earthenware, asbestos-paper, and
sheep’s skin. As a rule, the only preparation of the sub
stances is damping with distilled water.      Asbestos mill-board
is one of the best materials to   operate upon.
    The coating of mercury formed by this electrical process is
far more perfect than any I have been able to obtain by the
methods of “pickling” or contact-pressure.         I have no defi
nite views as to the cause of the phenomenon, but I am
inclined to regard it as a secondary action, the result of elec
trolysis, aided to some degree by electric osmosis.           The
experiments of Mr. C. K. Falkenstein * upon the electric
tanning of leather are evidence in favour of the osmosis
theory. I understand also that electric osmosis has lately
been used for administering cocaine, replacing the ordinary
hypodermic injections.
     It will be remembered that in some experiments f I recently
described to the Physical Society a globule of mercury, elec
 trified in a partially conducting liquid, sent forth a tentacle
 in a direction towards the positive electrode. It is perhaps
 significant that in the present experiments the film is always
on the positive surface.     In the case of liquid “coherers ” it
is possible to conceive that, under the influence of steady or
transitory currents, mobile conductors attempt to creep in
 this fashion through the dielectric films. And, again, though
 the effect is probably very slight and entirely masked by
 electrolytic disturbances, sea-water may thus penetrate the
 dielectric at a “fault” in a cable. The film-forming process
 may be of practical utility where large surfaces are required
 to be coated with mercury, as in gold extraction ; and pos
 sibly in the preparation of plates for primary or secondary
batteries.
   The following experiments are given in illustration of the
action  :-
    (1) A sheet of filter-paper, damped with distilled water, is
folded upon itself four or five times.   It is then laid flat upon
a  conducting   surface.   An indiarubber ring is pressed down
on the folded paper, and mercury is poured in to         fill
                                                         the ring.
A    battery  of200 volts      then connected for about three
                               is
minutes between the mercury and the lower conducting plate,
the mercury being positive.      After stopping the current the
ring   is removed from the filter-paper and superfluous mer

Prof. Young in his paper.    Accepting the formula, and
writing it as

where      and a are functions of the volume only, the values of
           b
band a for a large number of volumes are given in the paper
(loc. cit. pp. 650–655), and they are sufficiently numerous to
enable us to fully test any algebraic expression that endeavours
to represent them.                     I
                           spent a considerable amount of time
examining the values of a and b, testing the formulae that
have been proposed by various physicists, as well as others of
my own devising, without arriving at any that gave complete

more definite results could be secured by examining some
physical quantity which depended upon both 4 and b than by
examining b and a separately by themselves. Thus if we

   If b and   a in any gas-formula             can be expanded in powers
of v-' as assumed, and if AaB,-AgBs is different from zero,
which will in general happen, the decrease of T from the
maximum value will be as r-' ; so that the proposed formula
is inadmissible.
   Let us now return to the quantities a and b. The values
of
    ..  were plotted against e-3 by                 Prof. Young,    and the
resulting diagram is given in his paper (loc. cit. p. 653). The
curve determined by the points plotted would seem to be
of a somewhat complicated character, and I do not think it
possible to obtain any simple formula that will reproduce it
entirely. On the other hand, there seems to be considerable
evidence of discontinuity in the neighbourhood of vol. 3:4:
and even if there is not discontinuity in the true mathematical
 sense of the word, there appears to be such a rapid alteration
of behaviour as to amount in practice to the same thing. The
easiest plan is to treat the curve as consisting of two parts,
 the formula passing abruptly from one expression to another
 somewhere in the neighbourhood of vol. 34. Whether this
accurately represents what takes place in nature is uncertain,
 but there is no doubt that it immensely simplifies the problem.
 We may therefore confine our attention to volumes above
 3-4; and of the formulae already proposed                 I found the best
 to be that suggested by Mr. W. Sutherland, who has given a
 gas-formula equivalent to putting

                                        v(p + k)”
 where   l  and k are two constants characteristic of the gas
 (Phil. Mag. xxxv.      p. 215).        I  have taken the following values
 of the constants
                      l=5,420,800,               k=3.636.

XI.      On the Conditions which Determine the Ultimate Optical
     Efficiency of Methods for Observing Small Rotations, and on
     a Simple Method of Doubling the Accuracy of the Mirror
     and Scale Method.                   By F. L. O. WADsworth *.

             on the                           of Methods for
              Small     Rotations,” Rayleigh discussed some
years ago the relative limiting accuracy of the two methods
then commonly in use for observing small angular deflexions
of a suspended system ; i.e., the Gaussian method of scale and
mirror, and the method of the pointer and microscope. The
conclusion was reached that theoretically the two systems
were on a par with each other when the length of the pointer
was equal to the diameter of the mirrorf.
     It    would       therefore seem that the latter method has a                            con
siderable advantage over the former, since for a given weight,
or, what is more important, for a given moment of inertia, it
is possible to make a pointer of a length of at least ten times
the diameter of a mirror, and thereby attain with a given
time of swing a tenfold greater sensitiveness.      But notwith
standing this apparent theoretical superiority of the microscope
and pointer, the mirror is in practice nearly always preferred,
not only because of                its
                        greater convenience, but also because

readily seen that this movement is just that required to
separate the superposed images of two lines, one of which is
fixed, the other seen by reflexion in the mirror, by the
amount necessary for “resolution”".
   The corresponding expression for the microscope is deduced
on the assumption that the smallest linear movement that can
 be observed with this instrument is also equal to the limit of
 resolving power. This, according to the researches of Helm
 holtz f, is

the two methods are equally accurate when

    It will be noticed in the first place that both of these
 expressions are based on the assumption that the smallest
 measurable angle or distance is the same as the corresponding
 angular or linear resolution.     But in general there is a
 difference between these two quantities.        The smallest
 measurable   quantity depends  not on the resolution of one
 object from another, but on the accuracy with which one
 object can be located with respect to another. According to
 Michelson this “accuracy” for any optical instrument is
 directly proportional to the resolving power, and is therefore
 represented by an expression
                                    A = a R,
 where A represents the accuracy (the reciprocal of the
 smallest length or angle that can be detected); R is the reso
 lution (the reciprocal of the angular or linear resolving
    * The term “resolving power” has been erroneously applied by some
 to the expression (1).    In     its
                                  commonly accepted meaning the term
 resolving power refers simply       the capacity        optical system

in every respect to the first    save that it is broadened in the
inverse ratio of the aperture   of the eye to the aperture of the
mirror or objective ; the only effect of interposing the latter*
being to change the apparent magnitude of an object of finite
dimensions or the apparent brightness of point sources (such
as stars).   The retinal image of the reference-line or cross
wire will also be a diffraction pattern which will be similar to
that of the line under examination.       These two patterns will
be of the same width when the angular width of the line itself
as viewed from the objective (or mirror) is the same as the
angular diameter of the cross-wire as viewed from the eye
lens, and when the aperture of this latter is just sufficient to
admit the full cone of light from the first aperture.       Under
these circumstances the conditions are exactly the same as
they would be if we were looking through any instrument at
two parallel lines of the same width, except that when the
observing instrument is moved only one of the images at the
focal plane changes                  its

It is   therefore an advantage that the cross-wire and reference
lines have a certain small finite width, not only on account of
greater distinctness but also because, as long as the width
does not exceed the value given in (4), they are more easily
resolved, i.e., a smaller angular movement of one with
respect to the other can be measured.
      I. Suppose as before that both objects are of the same
character but are not superposed.              The smallest relative
movement that can be detected in this case depends upon a
number of things, amongst others the initial distance between
the centre O of the image and of the wire or reference-line ;
the width of the image and wire; and to a greater extent
than in the preceding case on the ability of the observer.           In
any case of this kind it adds greatly to the accuracy of the
determination to have either two reference-wires, one on each
 side of the image, or two images moving together on each
side of the single fixed reference-wire.          The first condition
corresponds to the case of locating the position of one engraved
 line on a bar (or narrow pointer) in a microscope by means
 of the double (parallel) cross-wires; the second to the case of
 locating the lines of a scale seen by reflexion from the
 revolving mirror with reference to a single fixed cross-wire
 in the eyepiece of the observing telescope.         In either case, if
 the central object is nearly midway between the outer two,
 and if these latter are sufficiently far apart in comparison
 with the width of the former, it will be possible to estimate a
 shift of one system with respect to the other of from                            l'o   to
 so    the whole interval        8between the two outer objects.
 The ultimate accuracy therefore depends directly              the pro  on

it is important not to make the distance either between the
double cross-wires or the lines on the scale too small, nor on
the other hand too large.    When we know the law of varia
tion of A with 8 we can determine exactly what separation
would give the best result in a given case. Let us suppose
as before that the conditions are such that the final (retinal)
images of object and reference-wire have the same width.
Then when 8 is zero the two outer images merge into one
and we have the case previously considered, in which we
found that the smallest observable movement under the
most favourable circumstances was that which produced a
separation

  Suppose next that the two outer objects are separated by
an amount equal to about twice their own width, as in fig. 2.

be clearly separated from each of them, and it would be easy

conditions assumed by Boys, i.e. dark images on a bright
field, are more favourable to accuracy of reading (because
the images appear narrower) than the reverse arrangement.
Under the most favourable circumstances (see experimental
results quoted on p. 85) the smallest observable movement of
one image with respect to the other seems to be between , and
   the limit of resolving power. This corresponds to a linear
movement of about 1'a() A in the case of the microscope,

character—one    light, the other dark.      In this case the
accuracy in setting will increase with the width of the image
with respect to the reference-wire (Michelson) provided the
former is bright enough to be distinctly seen.    If the width
is great enough the position of the image with respect to the
wire can be determined to within one per cent., i. e. the
accuracy may be 50 times the resolution of the instrument.
But from what has already been said (p. 87) it is evident that
the only method of broadening the image of a narrow line,

                       a telescope
the image of the cross-wire as seen through the eyepiece
alone, is to make the effective angular aperture of the tele
scope or microscope objective much smaller than that of the
eyepiece. This entails a loss not only in contrast between
the two images, but also        (if
                               carried too far) decrease     the               in

92         Prof. F. L. O. Wadsworth on the Optical Efficiency
must now add a third, the interferometer method, first sug
gested * by Michelson.  I think that the only applications of
this methºd to the measurements of the deflexions of a sus.
pended system that have yet been made, are those recently
described by Barus f and by myselff, but these are sufficient
to prove     practicability and determine

diameter, instead of the full mirror.    But this advantage
disappears if we simply cut away those portions of the mirror
outside of the rectangle enclosing B and D". When this is
done the simple mirror becomes considerably more efficient
than is indicated by the preceding comparison.         This is
because the effective aperture b of the mirror is the distance
between the extreme edges, while the aperture b' of the other
then becomes possible to estimate and measure angular movements cor
responding   to less than       tº
                                of a fringe, or, less than } the amount
indicated as measurable in the case of a freely suspended system.    For
such purposes, also, the interferometer possesses other considerable ad
vantages in the way of lightness of the moving parts and (at least for
very large apertures) cheapness.
   * The advantages of this form of mirror, as compared with the full
circular mirror, have also been pointed out by Boys, who used it in his
 work on the determination of the Newtonian Constant.                           (See memoir

the surfaces is equal to the diameter of the moving mirror
                                      Fig. 6.
the angle of incidence will be about 20° and the aperture
effective for resolution will therefore be about 92 per cent of
the full aperture.         If we need to read deflexions on both
sides it will be necessary to place the second mirror m' so
that it makes a larger angle with the first, as in fig. 6... In
this case the effective aperture will be less, but may still be
made as large as 75 per cent. of the full aperture”.
    It is very easy to add the additional mirror to a magneto
                 º
meter or electrometer, or to a galvanometer in which the
mirror is between the coils instead of inside of one, as in the
older forms of the Kelvin instruments.               The doubling of the
deflexion for a given movement of the suspended system is
particularly advantageous in instruments intended for auto
matic registration (photographic or otherwise), because in
such instruments the requisite linear movement on the record
sheet can be secured when the distance of the latter from the
instrument is only half what is necessary with the customary
mirror arrangement.

   * When the angular deflexion is large there is a further slight dimi
nution of aperture due to the lateral displacement of the beam at the
second reflexion. When the distance between the mirrors is equal to
the diameter of m, this lateral displacement is about 2 per cent. of the
aperture for each degree of deflexion of the image.

earlier paragraphs, they seem sufficiently transparent not to

    Another distinctive feature of the Dublin School of Mathe
matics of those decades—one which was perhaps peculiar to
that school—was the large introduction of these same accurate
methods into the study of the various branches of Physics.
This was chiefly due to the influence of MacCullagh on the
teaching of the University; and his suggestions were being
actively developed and extended in the instruction given to
undergraduates in the student days of the present writer—
from 1844 to 1847—which were the last years of MacCullagh's
life.
    Some years afterwards a change was made in the curri
culum of Trinity College, Dublin, which had the effect of
diminishing the stress which the College until then had laid
 upon the earlier and necessary steps of the training of the
 mind for such pursuits; and as a consequence the attention
 paid by schools preparing for the University, to developing
the geometrical insight and skill of their pupils, gradually
 fell off. One result, probably unforeseen and certainly un
 fortunate, has been that much valuable unrecorded work that
 was done in the University of Dublin in those earlier times
 was not followed up; and has been, or is in risk of being, lost.
 Circumstances have occurred within the last few months,
 culminating in Mr. Preston's announcement in the June
 number of the Philosophical Magazine, which have brought
 forcibly to the knowledge of the present writer that methods
 of great value which were then employed in physics have
 become a lost art, unknown to the present teachers and
 students of the University.
               I
    In what have written within the last nine months about
 wave-motion, and especially in the paper at p. 273 of the
 April number of the Philosophical Magazine, I applied what
 used to be called “MacCullagh's method,” or “Proof by the
 Principle of Reversal,” to the study of wave-motion, for
 which it is in a special degree adapted. In doing this I
assumed that my readers understood the fundamental prin
ciples, upon which            all

106           Dr. J. C. Beattie on the Electrification of
foil was negatively     or positively electrified.    The electrifi
cations were less than those obtained with the uranium bare.
For example, with the uranium wrapped in aluminium foil
kept at +2 volts and the lead cylinder connected to sheaths,
or with the first to sheaths and the cylinder at      –2  volts, the
air when drawn through the filter raised it to a potential of
 + 11 of a volt per minute of pumping.             With + 10 volts,
the potential per minute of pumping was +0.05 of a volt,
with 95 volts, + 0.15 of a volt per minute. The negative
electrifications of the air with the uranium wrapped in alu
minium foil kept at –2, — 10, or —95 volts, and the metallic
cylinder to the sheaths of the electrometer, were smaller than
the corresponding positive electrifications given above for
 +2, + 10, and +95 volts.
   Finally the uranium was placed inside a paraffin cylinder.
Round the outside of this cylinder tin-foil was wrapped.
With both uranium and tin-foil connected to case—arrange
ment (a)—there having been no previous electrification of
the uranium in the paraffin cylinder, the air drawn from the
cylinder showed no sign of electrification.
   With arrangements (b) and (c) similar results were ob
tained to those found when the cylinder used was of metal,
with this difference, however, that the amount of electrification
with any given voltage depended on the voltage which had
been used in the experiment immediately preceding.              For
example, after the tinfoil round the cylinder of paraffin had
been connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and
the uranium to sheaths, it was found that the air drawn
through the filter raised it to a potential of — 235 of a volt
per minute of pumping.           In the succeeding six minutes,
while the tinfoil was kept at — 10 volts, and the uranium to
sheaths, the electrometer deviation was equivalent to a rise in
potential of the filter of +7 of a volt per minute.          In the
succeeding two minutes the rise of potential was +6 of a
volt per minute, and six minutes later it was + 3 of a volt
per minute.
   Both uranium and tinfoil were next connected to sheaths
—arrangement (a)—and in the first two minutes of pumping
the rise of potential of the filter was –   6 of a volt per minute.
In the second two minutes the rise was only
per minute.
                                                     – 13 of a volt
   With the uranium connected to sheaths and the tinfoil at
+ 10 volts, the air was found to be negatively electrified; the
amount of this electrification was such as to raise the potential
of the filter — ‘G5 of a volt per minute in the first minute and
—"Z of a volt per minute in the tenth minute.

emitted    by  a Substance” f, there is a reference to the work of
the late M. Fievez, who found that instead of a broadening of
the spectral lines there were reversals and double reversals,
which Zeeman has not observed.
   In some cases the magnitudes to be observed are of the
order of a fortieth of the distance between the sodium lines,
and should be clearly seen in a good spectroscope under
proper conditions; but others occur in which they are but a
third or a fourth as large, and in these cases             detail     lost     all              is

of Fievez, that the effect of a magnetic field is to produce
reversals.  The appearance of the figure itself seems to
indicate a true separation ; the depression bearing a much
larger proportion to the whole area than we are accustomed
to observe in reversals; but this by itself would hardly be
considered conclusive.       It was thought, however, that if
there were a true        separation, the distance between the
components should vary with the strength of the field,
whereas in the case of a reversal one would expect only an
increase in the darkness of the absorption.
    Accordingly a series of observations was made with varying
strength of field, the results of which are shown in the
visibility curves of fig. 1, and the corresponding intensity
curves of fig. 2. The strength of field in the order of the
letters was 0, 5, 7, 11, 16, 20. It appears from the figures
that up to a strength of field 11, which is about 2000 C.G.S.,
the principal effect is a doubling of the line ; but beyond this
the component lines are broadened as well as separated.       It
is also clear that the separation is nearly proportional to the
strength of field.    Thus, assuming this law to be true, the
following table shows the agreement between the observed
 and the calculated distances. F=strength of field ; A = dif
 ference of path in millimetres corresponding to visibility 50
 for single source ; 8 = corresponding half-width of the source
 on a scale of 100 for D1–D, ; D = period of the coincidences
 in millimetres due to the doubling, and 2 = the corresponding
 distance between the components.

is to broaden the spectral lines, and the theoretical investiga

of the element in the solid form. Therefore it might be
expected that the measured shift would vary in the same
direction as the coefficient of expansion of the solid. This is
actually the case, with no exception.      Again, since on any
theory of emission of waves the wave-length varies directly
as the linear dimension of the portion of matter producing
the waves, it would be expected that the measured shift
would vary directly as the coefficient of linear expansion,
which is found to be the case. If a is this coefficient, it may
be stated as an experimental law that for different elements
S=ca, where         c   is a constant which                  in some way connects
the ordinary changes in size of a solid due to temperature
changes with the hypothetical changes in the size of the mo
lecules of the vapour due to pressure changes.
   It is not difficult to see that one would expect, as conse
quences of the above ideas, that the shift would be proportional
to the total increase of pressure, regardless of           mode              its                of
production                   should also vary directly

wires were tested again. They          showed elongations with
the fields both       on
                    and off               up

                                               to
curve turns towards the horizontal.       The elongations here
are greater with the field off than when          on.   But          it    is                    on
each curve the   elongation  increases nearly    direct propor            in
tion  to the induction.   Not far from the turning point    the                            of

show any change, this value                     of          not exceeding             7   x   10-7.
At about the    same point the curve with field         begins                   on              to

   The curves for the very soft wire are     general exactly         in
like those for the annealed    piano-wire, except  that the
changes    of   length are very much greater, and                               in   some cases

for weak fields and slight tension, the wire shortens when the
field is removed.   But in these cases the residual induction
 n the wire is always much less than the induction with the
field on.    And finally the elongation with the field off
becomes as great or even greater than the maximum elonga
tion with the field on. After this the length tends to remain
constant until the end of the experiment, although there is
a very slight shortening for the strongest fields.    This per
manent lengthening          for the soft iron gave a value                of    |   as
great as 33 × 10-7 for the least tensions used.         The straight
portion of the curves with field on shows a contraction that
is much more rapid than for annealed piano-wire, and its
slope is more than twice as great as that for the natural
piano-wire.
   Increased tension showed exactly the same effects as upon
the annealed piano-wire, though the amount of the changes
due to tension was much greater.
   The complete series of experiments would tend to confirm
Joule's statement that the changes in length caused by mag
netization are greater in proportion to the softness of the
iron.    This is more marked in the initial elongations than in
the final contractions.
   The elongation curves, both when plotted to magnetizing
force and when plotted to induction in the iron, seem to
show an elongation due to the magnetic induction in the wire
and a contraction caused by the magnetizing field, directly
proportional to the field in value.       In         all
                                                 cases for    definitea
induction the wire was       longer  with the field off than with
the field on.
   More than one application           the same magnetizing field
                                        of
gave slightly cumulative effects.         Repeating any reading,
thus, made the change         very little greater

        1. “Note on a Portion of the Nubian Desert South-east of
Korosko.       By Capt. H. G. Lyons, R.E., F.G.S.         With Notes on the
Petrology by Miss C. A. Raisin, B.Sc. And Water-Analyses by
Miss E. Aston, B.Sc.
    A general description of the physical structure of the area, which
consists mainly of Nubian Sandstone and crystalline rocks, is given.
Coming from Korosko to the Murrat Wells, the crystalline rocks are
first met with on the east side of Jebel Raft. At Wadi dur Nabadi
are ancient gold-workings, indicated by M. de Bellefonds on his map
of the Etbai. The crystalline rocks are both massive and schistose.
The strike of the latter to the east of Jebel Raft is north and south,
while to the south of the hill the strike is a few degrees on either
side of east and west.       On the crystalline mass of Jebel Raft, and
 apparently overlain by the Nubian Sandstone, is a very coarse
 conglomerate       containing   fragments    of crystalline rock, which
 appears to be older than the Nubian Sandstone.
     The Nubian Sandstone has little or no dip, and shows very slight
 variation in composition.      The water-supply of the Nubian Desert
 is  directly  dependent   on the rainfall, which is very irregular. The
 wells are sunk in the detritus of the valleys, and contain a large
 amount of mineral matter in solution, which renders them almost
 undrinkable; while the second source of supply—the rain-water
 reservoirs—are deep holes in the ravines which intersect the
  crystalline hills. These holes must be attributed to water-action;
  and in the reservoir of Medina in Jebel Raft the spherical stones
  which assisted in forming the pothole still occur.              The author
  believes that these ravines and reservoirs were formed at an earlier
  period than the present, when the rainfall was heavier.
      Miss Raisin gives accounts of both massive and schistose crystal
  line rocks, and also of sedimentary rocks. The crystalline rocks
  described include gneiss, hornblendite, gabbro, often much altered
  and resembling some of the Alpine gabbros, some allied rocks
  containing     lustre+ mottled    hornblende, other forms of diabase,
  quartz-diorite,    granite, felsites, certain schistose and a few dis
  tinctly fragmental rocks. None of the igneous rocks can be stated
  with certainty to have originated as a lava-flow.            Many of them
  have   undergone    much alteration since their     consolidation, and the
  results of this are described.      There is clear evidence in many cases
   of erosion by desert-sand and the formation of a weathered coating.
   The schistose rocks do not present a very modern facies, and might be
   late Archaean or early Palaeozoic. The massive crystallines may

belong to different epochs, but include some rocks (such as the
gneiss) resembling Archaean. These seem to mark an eastward
extension of the anticlinal axis previously traced by Capt. Lyons to
Wady Halfa in the Nile Valley from the west.
  Miss Aston gives two tables, one of which shows the actual
amounts of substances found in the wells of Murrat, Bir Tilat Abda,
and Bir Ab Anaga, while the second shows their approximate
constitution.

    The author still maintains the occurrence of two pre-Cambrian
groups in Anglesey, the later of Pebidian age.                In the present
paper a description is given of the production of gneissic structure
 in rocks of the earlier group occurring in the south of the

heathy Commons north and south of Newbury (as of Snelsmore and
Greenham).     About 6 feet of gravel is exposed at the average level
of 440 feet above Ordnance datum.             It has been referred to the
• Southern   Drift” by the late Sir Joseph Prestwich. At the edges
of the Commons some of this gravel slips down and mixes with
glacial deposits of later age.
    2. North of the town are the Glacial Gravel and Loam of
Donnington and the Bath Road (17 feet), ranging from 254 to 300
 feet above O.D.     At the confluence of the Lamborne and Kennet
 Valleys these beds have been much denuded.               The thickness,
 character, and composition of these deposits, as well as those of
 other gravels, etc., described hereafter, have been carefully noted by
 the author.
    3. The River-gravels of the Kennet Valley are of great interest,
 and have been carefully studied by the author at their several
 exposures, in Bull's Lane, the Enbourne Road. etc.              Here the
  Upper River-gravel forms fine broad terraces at about 260 feet O.D.
  Palæolithic flint-implements     are not uncommon in this gravel.
 Bones and teeth of mammoth, common and extinct ox, sheep, pig,
 horse, and reindeer have also been found in                         it.
                                                       Immediately north
 of  Newbury this terrace      cut off locally from the town
                                    is                                east                        by   an

     1. ‘ On Augite-Diorites with Micropegmatite in Southern India.
 By Thomas H. Holland, Esq., A.R.C.S., F.G.S., Officiating Super
intendent, Geological Survey of India. .
     This paper deals with a series of basic dykes intersecting the
pyroxene-granulites      and gneisses of the Madras Presidency, and
believed to be of the same age as the lava-flows of the Cuddipah
 system. These dykes consist essentially of augite (near heden
bergite) and a plagioclase-felspar (near labradorite), between which
we find masses of micropegmatitic intergrowths of felspar and
quartz, with a micro-miar olitic structure.            Around the patches
of    micropegmatite,   chemical   changes  have  frequently  taken place
in the minerals of the rock. Similar occurrences of micropegmatite
in basic rocks have been described by          J. A. Phillips and Waller
at Penmaenmawr, by Hill and Bonney in Charnwood Forest, by
Teall in the Whin Sill and in the Cheviot district, by the last
named author and Harker at Carrock Fell, by Sollas at Carlingford,
 and by Harker in Skye.
    After discussing the chemical constitution of the rock, and of its
various constituents, and the relation between the micropegmatite
and the surrounding minerals, the author points out that three
 methods for the formation of the micropegmatite may be conceived
of:—
       (a) During    the primary   consolidation of the magma.
       (3) By secondary changes induced in the rock.
       (y)  By subsequent intrusion of granophyric       material  into the
             augite-plagioclase rock.
      In opposition to (y), the author points out the (ntire absence of
 granitic intrusions in the neighbourhood.         He regards the absence
 of all  proofs of subaerial  hydration,  and the remarkable freshness of
 the rocks as precluding the possibility of the micropegmatite having
 been formed by secondary change. The primary origin of the micro
  pegmatite he believes to be proved by:—(1) The crystallographic
  continuity of its felspar with that of the normal plagioclase of the
 rock; (2) the mode of occurrence of the micropegmatite, filling in
 the angles and spaces between the augite and the plagioclase; and
 (3) its variation in coarseness of grain agreeing with that of the
 remaining two constituents of the rock.
     These augite-diorites with micropegmatite are then compared with
  the granophyric gabbros of Barnavave, Carlingford, described by
 Prof. Sollas, to which the author maintains that his explanation
 equally applies.      He insists that the separation of the acid and basic
  materials of a   magma,   which takes place so frequently on a large
 scale, equally occurs in the midst of a consolidating mass, and com
 binations such as that described in the paper will be formed.           He

insists also on the proofs of close genetic relations between the
gabbros and ‘granophyres,’ and of their practical contemporaneity in
the various districts in which these phenomena have been noticed.

Igneous Masses of the District.’ By the Rev. J. F. Blake, M.A.,
F.G.S.
   The author has observed thirty-two domes of various kinds in
Cutch, distributed as follows:—(i) those connected with the northern
islands; (ii) those of Wagir; and (iii) those along the northern edge of
the mainland.     They are divisible into four classes: (a) those which
are so elongated on the line joining adjacent ones that they seem to
be mere modifications of anticlinals, though the supposed anticline
is not really continuous; (b) those which               line, but are not lie     in
                                                                                  a
elongated      that direction,                   other;  (c) those which no
             to in                                               in in
                               and often
are related       fault, which cuts them
                     a                        half; and (d) those which
are not    in any particular relation       each other,      to any other                        or   to
stratigraphical feature.
   The domes vary          degree
                               in     perfection    some are irregular,
                                                   of                         :
while some have the strata running          concentric circles, the outer
                                                             in
and newer strata dipping away from the inner and older.                                                          In    no
less than ten       the thirty-two domes igneous bosses are found
                     of
occupying the centre, and these are distributed amongst           the                                      all   of
above classes.    The author gives reasons for maintaining that the
domes are the results               of
                             intrusion  igneous rocks       of

laccolites, and are not anticlinal folds which have afterwards been
affected    bycross-folds.   The domes are contrasted with igneous
peaks which occur              in
                           abundance      different partin the area,

                                the strata and          higher level above    at   a
sea.  These are  probably  volcanic pipes   through    which the lava was
forced and extruded            at
                         the surface.
   The author compares the rocks           the bosses with those
                                                            of         the                                       of

the former are distinguished          the presence by     intergrowths                 of                              of

   The author observes that his conclusions, if correct, may be
applied to explain the source of the Deccan trap without eruptive
centres. It may have been forced out from innumerable orifices as
from a sieve, none of these being so much larger than others as to
make a definite centre.

 (a) The Southern Division, extending from Moira to Lisburn.
Here the highest zone of the Chalk, that of Belemnitella mucronata,
 rests directly on the Triassic strata, the junction-bed containing large
pebbles, associated     with the above-mentioned species.—(h) The
Central Division, mainly including the sections between Lisburn
 and Belfast.    All the main lithological features are here displayed,
 namely: 1. Glauconitic Sands (a blue-green rock rich in glauconite);
2. Glauconitic Marls : 3. Yellow Sandstones (a light calcareous sand
stone); 4. Chloritic Sands and Sandstones of the Eco<U+017F>yra columba
zone (yellow-green sands and sandstones); and 5. White Limestone.
Under No. 3 Tate and 13arrois both included the zone rich in
Inoceramus-fragments occurring in the next division, but this zone
is different in colour and chemical composition, and is practically
absent in the Central area, the White Limestone with conglomeratic
or nodular chalk at the base resting unconformably on the lower
beds.    Palaeontologically,             all
                                    these lower beds are rich           large   in
dimyarian     bivalves, especially Trigonia, Arca, Cucullara, etc.—
(c) The Eastern Division, extending along the eastern coast from
 the neighbourhood       Carrickfergus
                          of                 north  to Carnlough, including
                                                              of
Islandmagee.      The Glauconitic Sands and Yellow Sandstones with
chert are present, but generally thinner than the same beds               the     in
 Central area.       In
                      them    dimyarian    bivalves are  very  rare, brachio
poda  of  stunted forms, corals, and sea-urchins having been,             the        on
contrary, only found        them
                               in              in
                                       this eastern  region.   The Era<U+017F>ura
columba-zone    isbarely represented, but the Inoceramus Crispi 2-zone
(which Tate thought        to       be
                               below that      Eco yra columba) attains
                                                     of                                    a
thickness  of  over 20  feet, and evidence       brought forward
                                                         is             show    to
that it overlies the Ec. columba-zone.         There         palaeontological
                                                                   is   a
unconformity between the two zones, the Inoceramus-beds passing
insensibly into the White Limestone without the intervention                          of   a

             The Cretaceous          Strata   of County Antrim.                  131
conglomeratic bed.--(d) The Peninsular Division. In the northern
portion of county Antrim, the highest zones of the White Chalk rest
on Archaean, Carboniferous, and Triassic rocks (which must have
formed a peninsula or insular area in the Cretaceous sea), the basal
conglomeratic bed being well marked, and old Cretaceous beaches
preserved.—Finally (e) The Northern Division. This occupies a
strip on the northern and north-eastern shores, and includes Rathlin
Island. The lower beds are only feebly developed, while the three
highest zones of the White Limestone (Belemnitella vera to B. mucro
nata) attain a great thickness, and are very pure chalk-beds. Taking
the various divisions together, it is concluded that Divisions b, c,
and e first underwent depression, area b being nearest to the shore
line, Divisions a and d being higher ground, and only becoming sub
merged at a late period in Upper Chalk times.

                                                    examination
logical types.—The    Glauconific Sands      are characterized by the
abundance of glauconite (23°/, CaCO,), showing evidence of having
been formed in the interior of foraminiferal shells; the Glauco
nitic Marls by an abundance of spheres and rods of pyrites; the
Yellow Sandstones by a series of heavy minerals, notably
rutile, zircon, tourmaline, kyanite, and perfectly-formed crystals of
garnet: the Inocera mus-zone contains delicate glauconitic mesh
works of hexactinellid sponges and silicified portions of Inoceramus
and brachiopoda, besides an abundant series of heavy minerals: in
the Chloritic Chalk above the Glauconitic sponge-casts become
very abundant, associated with delicate casts of foraminifera; the
White Limestone itself has scarcely any residue. The analyses
show that the percentage of carbonate of lime increases steadily from
base to summit, the Glauconitic Marls alone being an exception.
  III.  This section deals with the stratigraphical conclusions.    The
Glaucon itic Sands, regarded by Tate as equivalent to the lower
portion of the Upper Greensand, and by Barrois as synchronous
with the upper beds (Pecten asper-zone) of the same formation, are
regarded as having commenced to be deposited in the earlier portion
of that period, and to have been still forming during the Pecten
asper times in England. The Yellow Sandstones with chert are
mainly equivalent to the Warminster Sandstones with chert in the
S.W. of England. The above two beds therefore constitute the Upper
Greensand in Ireland. The Ea'ogº<U+017F> ra-columba and Inocera mus
Crispi 2 zones were both considered by Tate as Cenomanian, and
by Barrois as Turonian.      In the present paper they are considered
as absolutely distinct, the Eco<U+017F>yra columba-zone being truly Ceno
manian (as limited by Jukes-Brown and Hill); the Inoceramus
Crispi 2-zone, on the contrary, being similar in         fauna  its  the   to
Chalk Rock and lowest Senonian beds        England, and
                                               in                     on
                                                             theoretical
and faunal grounds being       preference assigned
                                in                    the latter.

  The Micraster-zones      of
                           the Senonian have been  directly recognized,
but the  higher ones  ofBelemnitella vera  (Marsupites)   and      qua     B.
drata are well  represented.   The nodular beds            at

White Chalk are of varying age, but generally referable to the above
two zones.      The conclusion arrived at is that there was a gradual
depression followed by a partial elevation, and a subsequent depres
sion of a far more pronounced character.        The Central Division
being nearer the shore, the deposits of detrital material here formed
were thicker, but at the same time during the period of elevation
the denudation was more considerable, so that the unconformity is
 very marked ; in the Eastern Division, where the sea is con
sidered to have been deeper, the detrital deposits were not so thick
and denudation less pronounced; on depression commencing at the
 beginning of the Senonian period, limestones containing a Chalk
Rock fauna were being laid down here, while denuding influences
 were still active in the Central area. Speaking generally, there
 was a deepening northward of the Cretaceous Sea, but the high
 ground in the north of County Antrim and south of Lisburn was
the cause of the very marked beach and conglomeratic features
observed in the Peninsular and Southern districts.
    IV.  General Questions.—The       author  here touches on and    dis
 cusses  (i) the occurrence of certain organic remains in the glaucomitic
 sands and yellow sandstones of the Eastern division, which suggest
 higher zonal conditions than those indicated by the species with
which they are associated; (ii) the great development of the
Evogyra-columba beds south of Belfast and their feebleness north
of that town, while the opposite holds in the case of the strata
with Inoceramus-fragments and Spondylus speciosus; (iii) cases of
unconformity      and overlap in the series; (iv) the existence of
definite beaches of Upper Chalk age; (v) evidence in favour
of the influence of currents; (vi) the relation of the Spongiarian
bands to the strata above and below: (vii) faunal repetitions; and
(viii) the general distribution of the Rhynchonella and Terebratula.
   2. “An Account of the Portraine Inlier.           By C. I. Gardiner,
Esq., M.A., F.G.S., and S. H. Reynolds, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
   At the north-western corner of the inlier a coarse conglomerate,
referred to the Old Red Sandstone, dips in a north-westerly direction,
and from beneath it a series of green and purple andesites having a
south-easterly dip appear. These andesites have undergone con
siderable change since their extrusion.       They are succeeded by a
conglomerate of varied character, of which the matrix is at first an
ashy shale, including fragments of ash, andesite, shale, and lime
stone.     Interbedded with the conglomerate are bands of limestone
and   shale,  which have yielded fossils of Middle Bala facies.     The
authors give reasons for maintaining that this conglomeratic series
is not due to earth-movement, but is a sedimentary accumulation,
though the case is otherwise with a conglomerate developed along a
thrust-plane which separates the volcanic series from an overlying
limestone.      This conglomerate is compared with one recently
described in the Isle of Man, though the alteration which marks
the latter is practically absent from the former.
   Igneous rocks like those found to the north-west of the outlier
are also seen at the southern end.

    The general succession of the greatly disturbed Portraine Lime
 stone Series from above downwards is :-3. Thin-bedded limestone,
 with shaly partings; 2. Beds of compact crystalline limestone,
 with many fossils; 1. Thin-bedded limestones, with shaly partings:
 the upper beds being in places crowded with corals. This limestone
 is comparable with the Chair of Kildare Limestone, and also with the
 Staurocephalus, Keisley, and Sholesbrook Limestones of Great Britain.
 Succeeding the Limestone Series, and separated from it by a thrust
 conglomerate, is a Grit Series, which has yielded no fossils, but
 which resembles the Balbriggan Grits containing black shales with
 Birkhill graptolites.

the fossils found by the authors, and offers some remarks upon the
age of the deposits.

GENTLEMEN,
IN Dr.
   your June number (p. 464) Dr. Neesen writes to say that
       Henderson and I made no mention of his name in paper                                    a

Electrolytes by means of Continuous Currents’ published in
 No. 260 of your Journal.
    We must in the first place express great regret at having
altogether overlooked Dr. Neesen's paper in Wied. Ann. vol. xxiii.
p. 4S2.     Some excuse for the omission may be found in the fact
that no reference to the paper is to be found in Winkelmann's Hand

   There are three ways known                   diminishing the disturbing

effects of  polarization in   the use      continuous currents:–
   (1) The use   of   so-called non-polarizable electrodes.

134              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   (2) The use of high potentials so as to drown the polarization
   (3) The use of a balancing cell in a Wheatstone bridge as first
suggested by Kohlrausch, employed           by Tollinger, and greatly
improved by Neesen
   The first method is of very limited application. The third
method by itself we know to be quite unsatisfactory, but combined
with the first it will be fairly satisfactory as Neesen found. The
combination of the methods (2) and (3) which we regard as being
the distinguishing feature of our method leaves nothing to be
desired, and is in our opinion much more convenient and accurate
than the alternating current method.       Dr. Neesen makes no claim
in his paper of 1884 to have devised a method superior to the
alternating current method.
   The last two paragraphs of Dr. Neesen's letter show how little
he appreciates the points of our method, one of the main features
of which is the employment of high potentials to drown the residual
polarization E.M.F.     This necessitates high electrolytic resistance,
not high resistance of the two equal arms of the bridge.

      SURFACE      TENSION OF WATER AND OF DILUTE AQUEOUS
                   SOLUTIONS. BY N. ERNEST DORSEY.
  During the past year I have been endeavouring        to determine
the surface-tension of dilute aqueous solutions by means of the
method of ripples.     All work previously done on the surface
tension of solutions has been on solutions of about one half normal
concentration, or greater, and most of the observers have deduced
the surface-tension  from the measured rise of the solution in
capillary tubes.
  For   at least  two reasons the method of capillary tubes is open
to serious   objections.    First, the height a liquid rises in a tube
depends upon the angle between the wall of the tube and the
surface of the liquid where it meets the tube. This contact angle
cannot possibly be measured, since the surface of the liquid lies
entirely on one side of the point where we wish to know            its
                                                                     incli
nation and
        ;         as
                   we can measure the inclination     of a finite surface
only, every measured value       ofthe contact angle must    be too large.
   The second objection     is that probably the surface-tension        of
                                                                       the
solution-glass   surface,  as          that   ofthe solution-air  surface,
                              well
                                      of as
varies with the concentration         the solution. If  such  is the case,
the surface-tension      found will   depend   upon  two  changes   which
cannot      readily separated, and which render the interpretation
            be
of the results difficult.
   For these reasons decided
                       I         by
                                  use the method    ripples, which
                                                       of
was first successfully used    Lord Rayleigh, although with his
                                   to
arrangement      apparatus individual observations differ
                 of                                          about by

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                            135
2 per cent.   After trying many plans one was finally adopted that
gives individual results that agree to about 3 per cent. ; and the
average departure of single observations from the mean of several
                                                                                     -
seldom exceeds 4 per cent.
   The waves were generated by a fork whose frequency was often
determined, and was always near 62.87 double vibrations per
second.    The water and solutions were contained in a porcelain
tray 1 by 12 by 14 inches. The wave-length was measured by
means of a telescope mounted on a dividing-engine, whose screw
had a pitch of 1.0328 millim.       The waves were invisible under
ordinary conditions, but were observed by Foucault's method for
rendering visible small vibrations in plane or spherical surfaces.
   The water used was especially distilled by Mr.W. T. Mather from
chromic acid and alkaline potassium permanganate, and was con
densed in a block-tin condenser; it was the kind used by him for
his electrolytic work. The salts were obtained from Eimer and
Amend, and were said to be chemically pure.
   With this apparatus I have determined the surface-tension of
 water and of solutions of sodium chloride, potassium chloride,
sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and zinc sulphate, of con

     PRELIMINARY Not E on THE ENERGY specTRUM of A BLAck
        BOl) Y. BY C. E. MENDENHALL AND F. A. SAUNDERS.
    in the Astrophysical Journal for August, 1895, Dr. H. F. Reid
 suggested the experimental study of this subject, based upon the
 theoretical deductions of Stewart and Kirchoff, that the radiation
existing in an enclosure with walls at a uniform temperature
would be independent of the character of the walls and would be
that of an absolutely black body at that temperature, provided
only that the walls had at least an infinitesimal absorptive power
for      all
        wave-lengths.     This work we have been carrying on, and
though        not completed, enough has been obtained

points is this length to be measured. . So the focal length of
a lens-combination is simply an abstract length, and not
necessarily the distance between two particular points.
    But the Royal Society method of finding the focal length
of a lens-system, as carried out at the Kew establishment, is
based on the definition that the focal length is the distance
between a focal centre and the principal focus; and these points
 having been separately found by processes not free from
objection, the distance between them is indirectly measured
 (vide Major Darwin's paper, “Proceedings of the Royal
Society,’ 1892).                        -
    Various methods have been described in an admirably
arranged bibliographical review of the subject by Prof. S. P.
Thompson.        In this paper the author also describes a method
of his own with an apparatus for carrying it out, but that
method depends on the same idea that the focal length is a
distance between two points.        The apparatus fixes those points
and measures the distance between them.             And the same may
be said of                all

    These photographs, being printed off the same negative
are exactly alike, and in use are turned with the film-side
inwards towards the lenses.
    If these photographs are made to occupy the positions of
 object and image, a comparison of the divisions actually on
 the plate examined with those of the image of the other scale
 received upon it will readily give the magnification,
    Groups of exactly ten divisions, at ten divisions’ interval,
are also indicated by dark bars for the convenience of reading.
An anatomical magnifier standing behind the scale serves to
 adjust to coincidence the planes of the actual and the image
scale with great accuracy; and it is also obvious that for any
one position of the sliding-pieces the magnifier may be applied
at both ends successively, each observation being thus checked
by another.
    To measure the movement of any sliding-piece a brass ruler
is screwed to it at right angles to the motion ; a slip of tele
graph exchange-paper is fixed by drawing-pins to cork pieces
at either end of the bank and the rulers pass immediately over
this slip, so that lines can be drawn on the paper by a drawing
pen or pencil at any position, and the range of motion accu
rately measured.
    To employ the instrument for convex lens-combinations,
such as photographic lenses and projectors, several methods can
be adopted.     The one scale and the combination being fixed,
search may be made for the image, which is adjusted accurately
to the other scale, and a mark made on the paper at the edge
at the corresponding ruler, and the magnification determined
and checked, if necessary, at the other end.
   The first scale may be then moved any distance, and the new
position of the image found and adjusted as before by moving
the second scale.     A new mark - is made, and the new magnifi
cation found and checked.                                       -
   If  m and n are the two magnifications

                                              and  l the distance
between the marks,                                           -
Or   the two scales may remain fixed and the combination may
be moved until accurate adjustment is obtained in the two
  ossible positions; the distance between those two positions
   ing obtained by marks, made on the paper along the edge
of the ruler attached to the combination.
   In this case the magnification which is the inverse in one
of the positions to what it is in the other may be ascertained

XXI.    Note on Mr. Blakesley's paper,    new Definition              “A                                       of
I
    Focal Length, &c.”  By Prof. A. GRAY ".
     HAVE          read     Mr. Blakesley's paper                     on    “A        new       Definition
      of Focal Length, &c.,” with much interest. It is true,
as Mr. Blakesley states, that the treatment of lenses and
combinations of lenses in ordinary text-books is frequently
faulty, and that much advantage would be gained by a con
sideration of the question from other points of view than that
generally adopted in treatises on geometrical optics. Some
thing of this kind has been achieved by the admirable series
of papers on points in physical optics which have appeared
from time to time, during the last fifteen years, from the pen
of Lord Rayleigh, and the lucid and elementary discussion of
the propagation of waves through lenses, and their reflexion
from mirrors, published by Dr. S. P. Thompson, in Oct. 1889.
    Ithink further clearness in the presentment of the action
of lens systems in important cases would be obtained if more
use were made of the notion of the apparent distance of an
object seen through a system of lenses.       This idea, which
is at least as old as Smith’s  ‘Compleat   System of Opticks’
(Camb. 1738), seems to have been strangely neglected until
attention was called to it again by Lord Rayleigh in the
 Phil. Mag. for June 1886. Yet the formula for the apparent
distance of an object situated on or near the common axis of
a system of lenses, and viewed along that line, yields at once
 from    its
         mere form many most valuable theorems: for example,
that the interchange         position   of                   of
                                           the image and object,

                                                  is              to

    Inthis mode           of
                    discussion attention          Mr. Blakesley's     is,   as   in

a function of the attenuation constant and the dimensions of
the line, and would appear to be immediately calculable. But
this is not all. For the above is on the     assumption  that
the losses occur only along the wires themselves, whereas
something is lost also on reflexion at the primary oscillator
where the waves are generated.        This fact soon became
apparent on the repetition of the experiment with different
lengths of line, and the value of this reflexion coefficient
was substantially confirmed by further experiments and by
the application of this new view of the case to experiments
previously carried out in Bonn.

   It may be interesting to regard, in the light of the results
in the second table, two sets of observations taken by the writer
in Bonn during the summer of 1893 while working under
the late Professor Hertz”.      In the course of those experi
ments (directed     primarily to an object quite different from
that now under discussion) the electrometer was placed almost
at the end of the line. By an entirely different method from
that now adopted, ratios were obtained for the electrometer
throws due (1) to the passage past it of the sum to infinity of
the geometrical progressions formed by the outward and
return waves, and that due (2) to the single passage of the
initial wave-train.    The lengths of the line to the electro
meter in the two cases were 160 and 91.5 m. respectively,
and the corresponding ratios were 1:0.34 and                                                 1   : 0.31.
Hence for this case equation (4) takes the form
                                      pºre-" = r—2,              .    .   .    .         .       .    (5)
since le=0.
   Solving simultaneously the two equations thus derived from
the experimental values of r, we obtain

  It   will be seen that the attenuation constant           the 1893               in
case  is about half that     the  present
                                     in    work.  This  may  possibly

154             Mr. C. S. Whitehead         on the Effect        of
   This value, while differing but little from that of p for the
condensers, spark-gap, and induction-coil at the oscillator,
differs in the direction that one might anticipate.      It also
supports the value previously found for p, in that p' though
greater than p is still distinctly less than unity. It will be
seen from the end of the article in ‘The Electrician,’ April
9th, 1897, that Mr. Heaviside scarcely expected the long
wave theory to be valid for the high-frequency waves here
used.
                :-
   Conclusion.—The chief results arrived at may be thus
summarized
   1. The value of the attenuation constant a for the line
experimented upon and the waves in use is of the order
0.000013, where the amplitude of the waves is affected by
the factor e-" in traversing a cm. of the line.   The energy
of the waves is thus reduced to half      by traversing about
250 m. of the line.
   2. The reflexion coefficient applicable to the primary
oscillator and induction-coil as used to generate the waves is
of the order 0:69, or rather more than half the energy is
lost on reflexion.    The reflexion coefficient of a precisely
similar arrangement   of condenser-plates but devoid of spark
gap and induction-coil is rather greater but still distinctly
less than unity.    On the long-wave theory the second of
these reflexion coefficients would be precisely equal to unity
and the first of them practically so.
  I  have to thank Mr. H. A. Ratcliff for help at the
beginning of this work, and especially Mr. R. S. Willows for
his valuable assistance at the later experiments and their
reduction.

 166       Messrs. Waidmer and Mallory on a Co.nparison
  as possible  similar to those under which they were used by him
  in his mechanical equivalent determinations.       On account of
  the many advantages offered by a Griffiths platinum ther
 mometer for the standardization of calorimetric thermometers,
 this instrument was selected for the comparison.           In the
 comparison the platinum and the mercurial thermometers
 were placed side by side in a calorimeter and the two
 read simultaneously while the temperature was slowly rising.
 Readings on mercurial thermometers were taken by means
 of a micrometer eyepiece.
     The stem corrections of the mercurial thermometers were
 made, as in Rowland's experiment, by surrounding the ther
 mometer stem for a short distance above the calorimeter with
 a water jacket, the remaining portion of the exposed stem
 being assumed to be at the temperature of the surrounding
 air. The mercury thermometers were placed in ice and dis
 tilled water for several hours and the zero determined before
 each comparison.         The corrected stem readings obtained in
 our comparison were then reduced to Rowland’s zero and the
 corresponding temperatures of his air thermometer taken from
 his tables of comparison of this thermometer with his Baudin
 thermometers (Nos. 6163, 6166). The platinum thermometer
 used in this experiment was one constructed by Mr. E. H.
 Griffiths. It was provided with compensating leads so that
 the temperature was independent of stem immersion, provided
 this was great enough to prevent conduction down -       §.  leads
to the   platinum   coil.
    The resistance measurements were made with a Griffiths
 resistance box (No. 7) especially designed for the measure
 ment of platinum temperature.           We are under great obliga
tions to the University of Chicago for the use of this box,
 which was kindly loaned us for this work. The construction
and calibration of a resistance box similar to the one used by
us has been described by Mr. E. H. Griffiths in “Nature,’
 November 14th, 1895.          The method there described was
employed by us. Two independent calibrations of the coils
and bridge wire gave practically identical results.
    Temperature on the platinum scale is defined by the
equation
                           t =        0.

where pt denotes platinum temperature, Ro the resistance of
the thermometer at 0°C., R1 the resistance at 100°C., and
R the resistance at the temperature pt. Platinum temperature
is therefore independent of the unit of resistance employed,

168     Comparison   of Mercury and Platinum Thermometers.
   The conversion from the platinum      to the air scale is made
by the following formula :—
                             (#)- <U+017F>º
                                   t \2     t
                  t–pt-6
where t is the temperature on the air scale, pt the platinum
temperature as defined above, and 8 a constant. . (For the
experimental evidence in favour of this formula, see the
elaborate comparison of the air and platinum thermometers
by Callendar and Griffiths, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. vol. clxxxii.
(1891), A). This relation being a parabolic one, only three
temperatures are necessary for the complete standardization
of a platinum thermometer, i. e. for the determination of 8.
The identity of our value of
                                |. with that obtained by Griffiths
in his standardization of our thermometer, made it unnecessary
for us to determine the resistance of the thermometer in
boiling sulphur (the third point usually employed), and we
therefore accepted the value of 8, 1491, given by Griffiths,
as correct.
   All auxiliary thermometers used for resistance box, measure
ment of air    temperatures,  &c., were compared and reduced
to air scale.
   Each of the mercury thermometers was separately com
pared with the platinum thermometer in two independent
series of observations.
   The results of the comparisons are best shown by the
accompanying curves, in which abscissae represent tempera
tures on Rowland’s air scale and ordinates the corresponding

mometers, which seem more dependent upon their previous
use than the hard glass thermometers. The depression of the
zero in these thermometers is large. Thus in one experiment
with 6163 the zero at the beginning, after the thermometer
had been at about 20°    for several weeks, was 60:

170           Mr. W. S. Day            on Rowland's Value                of
 constructed for the purpose.          Rowland's thermometers were
 originally compared with the air-thermometer in a vertical
 position, and they were used in the same position in the
 calorimeter.      This made it seem more natural to make the
  comparisons described here vertically also, but a number of
  reasons of a practical nature made the author decide to make
  them horizontally.      The chief reason for this was the neces
  sity of taking the zero-points of the Tonnelot thermometers
  after each reading, this being the method used at the Inter
  national Bureau, and which experience has shown to be the
  only accurate one. It was necessary, therefore, to apply a
  pressure-correction to the readings on Rowland's thermo
  meters to reduce them to what they would have been                    the          if
  comparison had been made vertically, but this was measured
  very accurately by an apparatus similar to that used at the
  International Bureau.         In         all
                                       other respects the attempt was
  made  to   use Rowland’s thermometers            the way    inwhich         in              he
 used them    in  his experiments.
     The Tonnelot thermometers had their zeros determined
  immediately after    a  measurement         any given temperature.
                                                     at
  The zero-points were determined                  by
                                                plunging the thermo
  meters into     avessel filled with finely-crushed ice mixed with
  distilled water. The ice used was very pure artificial ice.
  The vessel      inwhich the zero-points were taken was con
  structed   so that the thermometers could be immersed                the          in
  mixed ice and water       to  distance of
                                a              centim. above the zero

 taking zero-points, often interfere with the proper reading.
 The thermometers were always read,               taking zeros, and
                                                            in                             in

 each  of    Rowland’s thermometers, which, when applied                                   to

 172       Drs. Myers and Braun on the Decomposition
ment, and by Griffiths, taking the value found in each case
at 15° as unity, the two curves would be practically identical.
This seems to show that the difference between the value of
the mechanical equivalent found by Rowland, and that found
by Griffiths and by Schuster and Gannon using electrical
methods, may not be due to an error in the experiment itself,
but to some error in the electrical standards of resistance, or
of electromotive force.
   These results are in almost absolute agreement with those
obtained by Mr. Waidmer and Mr. Mallory. (See page 165.)
XXVI.      On the Decomposition       of Silver Salts by Pressure.
   By J. E. MYERs, M.Sc., Ph.D., late 1851 Eahibition Science
   Scholar, and F. BRAUN, Ph.D., Professor of Physics in the
   University of Strassburg i. E.”
A”       was demonstrated by Carey Leaf some years ago,
        silver salts and others may be decomposed by the
application of pressure.       By pounding a portion of the salt
in a mortar one     may  readily   effect decomposition.
   A convincing proof is obtained by compressing a halogen
salt of silver in the absence of sunlight and then subjecting
the compressed mass to the developing and fixing processes of
photography. A black residue of finely divided silver is the
                                                         º
result. Exposure of the salt to sunlight, before compression,
makes of course this test useless : the difficulty may be over
come by employing a mixture of AgNOs and                      (R = Cl,
Br, or I) in the first instance.
   The decomposition is most marked in the case of bromide
of silver.
   Two different metals immersed in liquid bromine constitute
a galvanic element f.      The couple Ag, Br, Pt has an E.M.F.
of about 0.95 volts.        It appeared therefore of interest to
determine the E.M.F. developed when AgBr is compressed
between electrodes of platinum and silver.
   The salt was contained in a so-called diamond mortar,
which was placed under a press and subjected to a pressure
of 3000–5000 atmospheres. The apparatus did not admit of
a direct measurement of pressure, but for purposes of com
parison, by using the same quantity of salt and turning the
lever to the same position the same pressure (approximately)
could be applied.      The pestle was insulated from the mortar
by means of a thin sheet of mica bent into a cylindrical

  after which the deflexion rapidly sank to zero.
     Thus the maximum E.M.F generated was about 0.07
  Daniell. The direction of current was from Ag to Pt through
  the compressed substance.
     A higher applied pressure produced           an   E.M.F. of      0.09
  Daniell.
     The silver bromide was prepared from pure AgNOs by
  precipitation with pure KBr. Before each experiment the
  salt was carefully dried by heating for two hours or more at
  a temperature of 150°C., and then allowed to cool in a
  desiccator.    Pure AgNO, showed no appreciable E.M.F. on
  compression, neither did KBr: a mixture of the two in
  equivalent quantities compressed between electrodes of Pt
     w; AgCl and AgI
  and Ag had an E.M.F. of 0.08 Daniell.
                               the  E.M.F.'s were smaller.
                    Ag, AgCl, Pt = 0.03 Daniell.
                    Ag, AgI, Pt = 0.04             »
 In  both cases a marked darkening in colour was noticeable.
    Somewhat remarkable is the fact that under high pressure
 AgBr becomes gradually transparent even when 3–4 millim.
 thick.    At the same time the electrical resistance increases
 considerably.      For instance, in one case the resistance
 increased gradually from 3-65. 10° ohms to 14-62. 10° ohms
  (measured with alternating current and telephone) in the
 course of 48 hours, pressure being continuously applied.

     Th;     investigation contained in this paper is a continua
          tion of a research on “The Condensation and the
Critical Phenomena of Mixtures of Ethane and Nitrous Oxide,”
which was read before the Physical Society some time ago f.
The results arrived at in the latter paper were stated as
follows:–
   (1) All             mixtures     of C, H, and N.0 which contain more
than 0.1 of C, H, have critical temperatures lying beneath
the critical temperature of C, Hg.
    (2) The vapour-pressures of the mixtures          partly above                lie
          N2O, and accordingly show
           C,of
those                                       maximum situated near   a
0-2      of
          Hs.
    (3) This maximum does not disappear with rise           tempe                             of
rature, but remains                 up
                              the critical region
                                            to     the maximum                  ;
curve reaches the   plaitpoint-curve.
    (4) The mixtures ranging between 0-2 and 0.5                 H,                                of   C,

 I    have now discovered two more instances of mixtures with
 similar properties, viz. mixtures                             of
                                         ethane and acetylene, and
 mixtures          of
                ethane and carbonic acid.           will begin                 I                             by
 relating some experiments which were made               connexion                      in
 with the former paper, and afterwards give         account     the              an                     of
 results obtained with those mixtures.

  3. In order to ascertain the probable reason of this diver
gence      I
        prepared some ethane from ethyl iodide, the method
used by Haenlen, and investigated          properties.   The          its
results   have been communicated             the Royal Society
                                                           to                                        of
Edinburgh.            will therefore
                        I             simply  state my conclusions
here      so
          far     they bear upon the point
                       as                        question.          in
   Ethane from      ethyl  iodide contains  variable quantity which

critical temperature and higher density than ethane, probably
butane.     This impurity raises both the critical temperature
and pressure, and lowers                       its
                                   vapour-pressures.    Pure ethane
is difficult    not impossible
                  if                obtain      to
                                               this method.     by
   This result accounts for Haenlen's critical values being
higher than mine (and probably also for Olszewski’s figures),
and   itshows       the same time the greater purity
                        at                               my ethane.                   of
Even this was not      absolutely  pure,    shown      some change

  5. In order to purify the gas further, it was compressed by
means of a Natterer pump into a small copper cylinder fitted
with high-pressure stopcocks”. In this process it was once
more washed in potash and subsequently dried by calcium
chloride and phosphorus pentoxide.        Pump and cylinder
were   previously exhausted  by a mercury   air-pump. During
the   compression   the copper   cylinder  was placed in solid
carbonic acid.    The pressure required to liquefy the gas was
pretty high : this shows that it contained a considerable
quantity of some permanent gas ; this may have been air
which in some unknown manner had got into the gas. By
thoroughly boiling the ethane, as much of this admixture was
removed as possible. The results obtained with this ethane
show that some admixture was left, of about the same amount
as in the gas which I used in my former experiments.      It is
noteworthy that with other substances, such as carbonic acid
and nitrous oxide, I always succeeded in removing practically
all   impurity         by
                      this process; for some reason the same thing
seems more difficult with ethane.                     not impossible that

pression-tubes with the gases consisted almost                  one piece                      of

tube     leading        tothe   compression-tube,       and another tube
through which the purified gas was supplied from the com
pression cylinder.            The connexion with the cylinder was
made     by  means          of
                            copper tube, sealed with sealing-wax into

 shown by a comparison of the p-t curves are this time slightly
 lower and the critical temperature a little higher. Absolutely
 pure ethane would probably have pressures slightly lower
 even and a slightly higher critical temperature.                 The p-t
 curves in the diagrams for ethane and the other single
 substances are drawn with ps; as this value is probably nearer
the true value of p than p.
         B. Mixtures of Carbonic Acid and Acetylene.
   10. In my former paper I gave a first instance of mixtures
having critical temperatures           below those for the compo
nent substances. The         only  instance of critical temperatures
above those of the     components      seemed to be that of mixtures
of carbonic acid and acetylene. According to an observation
of Dewar's ", a mixture of         3  CO, and      # CAH, has a critical
temperature    of 41°C,      those  for carbonic acid and acetylene
being 31° and 37° respectively.            It seemed necessary to try
the  experiment,    because   experiments      on mixtures have always
to be accepted with caution, unless it appears that exceptional

been worth         completely     investigating. The results which I
have obtained contradict Dewar's experiment.

      11. Both carbonic acid and acetylene were prepared before
I   was in a position to apply the method of purification de
scribed for ethane by condensation and distillation.                       I  had
therefore to resort to chemical methods of                 purifying  the  gases.
Carbonic acid was made from sodium bicarbonate and
acid.      The acid was contained in a boiling-flask provided
with a dropping-funnel with the sodium bicarbonate solution.
All solutions used were previously boiled and cooled in a
current of carbonic acid. The gas passed through sulphuric
acid and phosphorus pentoxide.                    Before the solution was
admitted the whole apparatus had been exhausted with a
mercury air-pump.
      12.  †.    purity of the carbonic acid was first tested in the
compression-apparatus           and appeared to be quite satisfactory.

      Amagat's values for the critical point are 31°35, 72.9 atm.
 The agreement is very close, the deviations of my values
 being probably due to a slight admixture of permanent gas.
 This would, in fact, make the vapour-pressures and critical
 pressure higher and the critical temperature lower.                      Similar
 deviations will be noticed            by   comparing       some of Andrews's
 values with Amagat's, the former having been reduced to

 ;
                                             had repeated this experiment of his
 (forming          of an essentially qualitative investigation carried out in
 1880), told me that his acetylene contained C.H.Br.             This accounts for
         igh critical temperature and low vapour-pressures            observed by
    lin.

 180    Dr.  J.  P. Kuenen on the Condensation and Critical
    Andrews's critical constants are 30°-9 and about 73 atmo
'spheres.     The deviations are in the same direction, only
 much more pronounced.            Andrews's carbonic acid contained
 about sº of air.
*                        Preparation of Acetylene.
    13.  This gas was prepared in the same apparatus as car
'bonic  acid,  from calcium carbide and water. The water had
been previously saturated with carbonic acid.                 The gas was
 washed in silver nitrate to absorb the         phosphoretted    hydrogen
and   sulphuretted      hydrogen    which it contained.       It was freed
             <U+017F>º
from carbonic acid by soda-lime and dried in sulphuric acid
 and phosphorus pentoxide.               Two samples were obtained.
The first    probably      contained some air and also some phos
phoretted                     In preparing the gas for the second
time, a second washbottle with silver nitrate was introduced,
 and this bottle was only just beginning to get blackened,
when the acetylene was collected. The only possible im
 purity of this sample is therefore a trace of air.
    Some of this sample was used in making the mixture with
 CO, the results for which are communicated below. Some
mixtures of the first sample with CO2 gave, however, similar
results.     The results obtained with the purer sample are
contained in Table W.

    14. Evidently the gas contained an admixture of some
 other substance. If this admixture is air, the vapour-pressures
 are slightly higher than for pure acetylene, and the critical
 temperature a few tenths of a degree too low. In this case
also the pº’s were used in drawing the vapour-pressure
curves in the diagrams.
   The pressures agree very well with those given by Villard",

provided at the bottom with a tap, an indiarubber tube, and a
funnel with mercury sufficient to fill up the whole of the

   17. The diagram (fig. 1) shows that the plaitpoint curve
is a line with small curvature and that mixtures of carbonic
acid and acetylene have critical temperatures between those
for the pure gases. The border-curve for the mixture inves
tigated is relatively narrow.  This entails small differences in
composition between the coexisting phases, the vapour con
taining only a little more carbonic acid than the liquid. It
also follows that the critical phenomena will closely resemble
those of a pure substance. This was found to be the case,
the plaitpoint temperature and critical temperature nearly
coinciding.
   18. An instance of a critical temperature above those for
the components has therefore not been discovered as yet.
From the theory it may be deduced that this phenomenon
will probably occur for mixtures which have a minimum
vapour-pressure at low temperature ; in the same way as the
critical temperatures below those for the components seem
to occur for mixtures which have a maximum vapour-pressure
(as for nitrous oxide and ethane).
   The law of the connexion between the two phenomena will
be again referred to in connexion with the application of
Prof. van der Waals's theory.

   19. The relative position of the vapour-pressure curves
and critical points in the t-p diagram of these gases was such
as to promise interesting results for mixtures of them : in
fact the same reasoning holds for this combination which led
me originally to the choice of nitrous oxide and ethane.          If
we consider the curves for the four gases the critical tem

   20.  I  began by preparing two mixtures of acetylene and
ethane   containing   0-68 and 0:27 of the latter gas respectively.
   After having got the constants for these two and not having
any more acetylene available at the time, I made new mix
tures by partly exhausting the compression-tube containing
the 0:27 C, H, mixture and introducing fresh quantities of
ethane.     In this manner four more mixtures were obtained.
Though great care was taken not to introduce any traces of
air into the tubes by this repeated process, it is not a safe
method, and the results seem to show, that some impurity
must have got into the mixture.        Moreover, the calculation
of the composition of each fresh mixture was again somewhat

pared   in  this manner, which, according         the calculations,     to
contained 0-76 C2H6, showed higher changes                 vapour                      of
pressure (p.–pº) than the first mixture (w-0-68), and                                                 at
the same time slightly lower critical temperature and higher
                     a
critical pressure. All this does not agree with the position and
shape    the plaitpoint curve.
        of                         The results for this mixture
had therefore        rejected. This also makes the values for
                         to   be
the other three mixtures (especially the last one) doubtful.
It must, however,        understood that this small uncertainty
                                    be
does not make the general result         the least doubtful, only

186    Dr.      J.     P. Kuenen       on the Condensation and                   Critical
  21. The Tables             VII.-XI.
                              contain the results for the five
mixtures ; the diagram (fig. 2) shows the relative position of
the vapour-pressure curves for the pure substances, the border
curves for the mixtures, and the plaitpoint curve which
envelops the border-curves.    Only two of the border-curves,
for mixtures 0.68 and 0:27, have been drawn in order not to
make the diagram too complicated.
   The diagram is qualitatively the same as that for nitrous
oxide and ethane : quantitatively there is a difference in the
circumstance that the mixture of minimum critical tempera
ture and the mixture of maximum vapour-pressure are much
nearer to each other than in the other case.      Mixture 0.51
was about the mixture of maximum pressure (point B), while
the minimum critical temperature (point A) occurs for a
mixture containing only a little more ethane (a -0.53 or 0.54).
The same points B and A were much farther apart for
N,0–C, H, where they belonged to mixtures w = 0:2 and 0:5
respectively.
   22. It was stated in my former paper that the critical phe
nomena of the mixtures of N2O and C, H, are little marked.

 tures were very little marked.      As just stated, mixtures con

 retically to show the critical phenomena of the second kind.
 For mixture 0.43 points P and C were, however, so near
 together that             I
                   could not observe a difference.    For mixture
 0:50 P is between M and C         ;  for mixture 0.30 M and P
 coincide, and very nearly also with C; for mixture 0.15 M
 seems to          lie

190      Dr.   J.    P. Kuenen       on the Condensation and              Critical
    In the following account of some of the theoretical results
I  will only consider the case of the coexistence of vapour and
liquid, i.e. a separation of the liquid into two will be excluded
from the consideration.
    I shall sometimes follow a method different from van der
Waals's, chiefly for the sake of shortness and simplicity.
    27. Let us suppose a set of isothermal curves (p-v diagram)
to be drawn for the mixture as determined by observations of p,
r, and t in honogeneous states, and completed by partly un
 stable interpolation-curves   joining the curves in the homo
 geneous gaseous and liquid condition.
    Suppose we forget for a moment that the substance is a
mixture, and apply the Maxwell-Clausius criterion for finding
 the coexisting phases in the usual manner.       We should then
 get the border or saturation-curve separating the homoge
 neous states from those where these are unstable or less stable
 than the separated states. The diagram thus obtained gives
 us the condensation-pressures, the vapour- and liquid-densities,
 and the critical point for the mixture, if supposed to behave
                                                                  <U+017F>º
 like a pure substance, i. e. not dividing into phases which
 have a different composition.     The real border-curve can only
 be found    by  a more   complicated   application of thermody
 namics : still we may easily see one thing, that the real
 border-curve would lie entirely outside the                   One
just obtained.     Instead of the horizontal line cutting off
equal areas from the isothermal, we get a sloping line : this
line has again to cut off equal areas. Obviously this is only
possible by making it start lower and finish higher than the
straight line. This is true at                   all
                                   temperatures, and the con
clusion        is,
                stated,
                     as that the border-curve will     entirely              be
outside the hypothetical one.    From this   follows, e.g., that
                                                             it
the real critical temperature    higher than the critical tem
                                            is
perature for the undivided mixture       also that the critical
                                                       ;
isothermal does not touch the border-curve       the top     but     at              M
at
a        point   to   the   right   C,   where     |<  0   instead of      = 0    as   for   a
single substance. The volume       the critical point obviously
                                                in                         is
larger and the pressure smaller than the same quantities                                     at
the top     of
           the border-curve.
   28. The last fact about the critical pressure (point       not                    C)
being the maximum pressure (point M) for the mixture                                         on
the border-curve was pointed out above with reference         the                    to
p-t diagram.      fact the loops for the mixtures are nothing
                          In
but the real border-curves represented          different manner.
                                                           in
The third   point    which      considered we                 in a
                                                 that case (plait
point), the point           of P

                                  the loop and the enveloping

         Phenomena                     of     some Substances          and Mictures.                    191
curve (plaitpoint curve), cannot be found by a simple geo
metrical construction in the p-v diagrams. The connexion
between the latter diagrams for different mixtures is not so
simple as the connexion between the loops (border-curves) in
the p-t diagram.   A point of intersection of two loops gives
the pressure and temperature at which the two mixtures to
which the loops belong will coexist as vapour and liquid".
The enveloping-curve contains the points of intersection of
loops infinitely near each other ; in other words, it gives the
conditions of pressure and temperature of the coexistence of
 identical phases: at those points the mixtures are therefore in
 the critical condition, and will display the critical phenomenon.
 Evidently these points P do not in general coincide with
either M or C. At the critical point C the mixtures do not
show the critical phenomenon, the latter belonging to P,
 where the temperature is lower.          This was fully explained
on former occasions.

   Table XVII. gives the calculated values of the hypothetical
critical temperature            compared with the real critical tem
                           as
perature.       The former is found to be everywhere lower than
the latter (except for mixture 0.43 CO2-C2Hs, where the
calculated value is 0°-08 above the observed T., a difference
almost within the limits of experimental errors): for the
maximum mixture the two naturally coincide.                 The differences
are   very     small,   especially    with   N20-C, Hs and CO2-C.Hs.
For C.H.-C, H, they are somewhat higher for mixtures
containing more         Cº.,      this is in agreement with the fact
that the critical        phenomena        were more marked for those
mixtures than for the others.                In plotting the values of
Table XVII.      against  ther's,    two curves are obtained,connecting
the same   points   C,  and  C,   and touching at a point corresponding
to B. The curves are close together and the minimum of a/b
should belong to approximately the same value of r as the
minimum T. The existence of a minimum for a<U+017F>b depends on
a1a/b1, being smaller than both ai<U+017F>bi and a2/b,”.            Table XVIII.

   41. Similar considerations hold for maximum critical tem
perature and minimum vapour-pressure.            A minimum vapour
pressure at low temperature means, according to the equation,
a maximum for a<U+017F>b : and a maximum of a/b is the same as a
maximum of the hypothetical critical temperature, and there
fore a fortiori of the real critical temperature. The minimum
pressure will move towards the substance of lower vapour
pressure, with rise of temperature, and may either disappear
or else exist up to the critical region.       It is easy to under
stand what the p-t diagram would be like in this case.              But
the case has not been observed        yet.    A minimum         vapour
pressure was found by Roscoe and Dittmar * for hydrochloric
acid and water and for nitric acid and water, by Konowalow f
for formic acid and and water, by Friedel f for hydrochloric
acid and methyl ether.       I hope to have an early opportunity
of trying the latter combination, which will not require tem
peratures as high as the combinations with water.
   42. One remark may be added.            In the condensation of
some substances it is assumed, that an association takes place
of molecules to more complicated systems. Substances with
which that happens do not obey the laws of corresponding
states and van der Waals's formula would be even more               in
adequate in those cases than otherwise.             We may expect
similar phenomena to occur in the liquefaction of some
mixtures. An association of that kind one would feel inclined
to identify with what is called the formation of molecular
compounds.      This would naturally have a great influence on
the  vapour-pressure,    and it is not unlikely, that rules like
those given above and deduced from van der Waals's formula
would fail entirely in those cases.       But   these  considerations
can only be tested by experiment.

 200         Lord Rayleigh on the Propagation of Electric
return.  For practical applications it is essential to treat the
conductivity of the wire as finite ; but for some scientific
purposes the conductivity may be supposed perfect without
much loss of interest. Under this condition the problem is
so much simplified that important extensions may be made
in other directions.     For example, the complete solution may
         i.
be obtained for the case of parallel wires, even although the
distance between them be not great in comparison with their
diameters.
   We may start from the general equations of Maxwell
involving the electromotive intensity (P, Q, R) and the mag
netic             (a, b,                c),
                             introducing the supposition that                                                all
the functions are proportional         e^***), and further that

   The problem is accordingly reduced to dependence upon
a simple potential problem in two dimensions.                 Throughout
the dielectric   b satisfies
                       dº/da”--d'd/dy”=0.             .   .   .   .   .   (7)
At   the boundary of a conductor, supposed to be perfect, the
condition is that the electromotive intensity be entirel
normal. So far as regards the component parallel to 2 this
is satisfied already, since R=0 throughout. The remaining
condition is that q be constant over the contour of any con
tinuous conductor.         This condition secures also that the
magnetic induction shall be exclusively tangential.
   It is to be observed that R is not equal to dºb/dz. The
former quantity vanishes throughout, while dib/dz remains
finite, since ºf ox e^***). Inasmuch as b satisfies Laplace's
equation in two dimensions, but not in three, it will be con
venient to use language applicable to two dimensions, referring
the conductors to their sections by the plane ry.
   If  a boundary of a conductor be in the form of a closed
curve, the included dielectric is incapable of any vibration of
the kind now under consideration.            For a function satisfying
(7) and retaining a constant value over a closed contour
cannot deviate from that value in the interior. Thus the
derivatives of b vanish, and there is no disturbance.                    The
question of dielectric vibrations within closed tubes, when m
is not limited to equality with p<U+017F>y, was considered in a former
Paper*.

    It is to be observed that this may also be proved analyti
cally—a circumstance not referred to by Mr. Preston.                  Some
proof on this head is essential, because Mr. Preston's extension
of Fourier's theorem has the unlimited generality of the
original theorem ; it applies indifferently to every motion in
space that can in any way be represented mathematically,
and takes no notice of whether it is physically or even geo
metrically possible.          When a proof is given that the three
impossible waves of Mr. Preston's equations give a resultant
which is a possible wave, when his treatment of the physical
problem receives, other modifications, and when the whole of
                                                  it,               be

208                     Dr. G.     J. Stoney            on   Proofs of
uniform plane waves, and is the principal one of a definite
group among them the members of which are characterized
by having no bearing upon the physical theorem.
   Again, on p. 283, Mr. Preston, gives a scalar equation
which he speaks of as “the analytical expression of the
general theorem enunciated by Dr. Stoney.” On p. 371,                                      I
pointed out that the first step towards correcting this oversight
is to substitute three expressions for £, m, and & for Mr. Pres
ton's single expression.     This Mr. Preston does in his subse
quent letter in the June number of the Magazine, p. 458.
The further steps necessary to complete the correction are :
(1) To add the proof referred to above in the third paragraph
of this letter; and (2) to embrace the entire of space in the
investigation.
   This naturally leads to the remark that when Mr. Preston's
investigation is confined to a limited area round the originating
disturbance it furnishes a different resolution.       This is a
kinematical * resolution; and the kinematical resolution of
                                                                            º:
this Fourier analysis is only one of innumerable resolutions
of a like kind that are possible.   Attention was called to their
unlimited number in my first paper on Microscopic Vision.
   It is very instructive to trace out what the              is to
understand by that particular resolution which the Fourier
analysis offers to us, when it is made applicable to space of
three dimensions and when it is restricted to a defined area.
This can be done. Let the whole of space be called A ;
 let the “prescribed area” (which includes the originating
disturbance and         limited region about
                         a                               called B; and
                                                                 it)   be

the radiations from the        originating    disturbance (which may
spread    to any distance)               be
                                     resolved into trains       uniform          of
plane waves         infinite extent laterally and travelling with

                                  the medium.       These waves can
advance unchanged through the medium, and are                   body             a         of
uniform plane waves which we shall call (a). This resolution
is  unique.        It    that special one which results from the

                                                      undulations may

                           was working in 1891 on the magnetization
of wires of  iron,  steel, and nickel, which had received a permanent
set, I found that excellent telephonic effects could be produced by
means of wires under stress (p. 395, Phil. Mag. 1891, vol. xxxii.).
The authors of the paper mention the difficulty of comparing the
speaking-powers of different instruments. I expect that a form of
electrodynamometer,        which was shown in the Electrical Exhi
bition in Paris of 1881, would be found of use in comparing the
relative outputs of different kinds of telephonic apparatus.        The
instrument was constructed thus : —a small light coil, carried on
a balanced arm hanging by a bifilar suspension, moved over a
curved solenoid which passed through            The alternating current

surfaces of feeble kathode rays may be doubled or bifurcated if the
rays are strengthened.        This phenomenon may be compared with
the bifurcation of the interference surfaces of strong sound waves
which was demonstrated by E. Mach.
   The author contests the existence of Goldstein's deflexion as
being due to an action at a distance of the kathode elements on
the kathode rays.        The phenomena of deflexion may be explained
partly by interference and partly by the electrostatic deflexion
of kathodic rays.
   Even before the discovery of the electrostatic deflexion of
kathode rays, it was inferred from the theory of the author that
simple feeble kathode rays follow the maxima and minima lines of
the electrostatic field, but are deflected from these lines by
magnetic force.       This is calculated to explain           the deflexions            all                         of

      HE  changes brought about by heating in the various
       physical properties of iron have been, since the first
investigations into the nature of the phenomenon of recales
cence by Gore and by Barrett, the subject of much experimental
work, which, during the last ten years, has been largely upon
the relation of the magnetic properties of iron to temperature.
   As long ago as 1879, however, Baur of Zürich f described
experiments on an iron bar inserted while hot into a long
magnetizing helix, which served to determine            permeability           its
at   any instant, the temperature being estimated from                                                        a

researches of Ledeboer in 1888 *, and by those of Dr. Hop
kinson, communicated to the Royal Society in 1889 f. In
the latter, a ring-magnet was used, furnished with primary
and secondary coils insulated with asbestos, and capable of
withstanding a red heat, which temperature was obtained by
means of a gas-furnace.    Measurements could thus be made
of the permeability of the iron core by the ballistic method,
and the temperature was deduced from the resistance of the
copper secondary winding.
   M. Curie, in a more recent investigation f, used a method
by which the permeability could be obtained in intense
magnetic fields.    He experimented on a sample of iron in
the interior of an electrically-heated porcelain furnace, and
                                                                                                  on

                        and Electrical Resistance                of Iron.                   215
   The heating was carried out electrically.     For this purpose
the ring (which was made quite small, about an inch in
diameter) was covered with a non-inductively wound layer
of insulated platinum wire. By passing a suitable current
through this wire the temperature could be raised to any
required extent. The heat was thus generated exactly where
wanted; and by wrapping the ring thickly with asbestos
the loss of heat by radiation was made small, and the tem
perature in the interior fairly uniform.
   In the experiments of M. Curie, 1500 watts were absorbed
in obtaining a temperature of 1350°: by the above method,
73 watts (a current of 4-6 amperes with 16 volts across the
terminals) was found sufficient to maintain the ring at 1150°;
and 45 watts sufficient at 800°, i.            above the criticale.,
temperature             of
                    the iron.   Dealing thus with comparatively
small currents, the accurate regulation          the temperature       of
was rendered      simple;   whilst absolute   constancy  for long
periods     the heating current, and therefore

                               accumulators      good order, not     in
difficult to attain.
   To avoid oxidation       the iron, the ring-magnet was placed
                                  of
in    a   glass vessel,           and      the electrical            connexions         brought

  The experiments with the second ring (whose core was

216            Dr. D. K. Morris on the Magnetic Properties
formed of a length of ordinary soft iron wire) were more
successful; but the results, though interesting, have not been
thought worth including in this paper. The experience gained
in the construction and use of the first two ring-magnets was
turned to account in the two later ones.
   Platinum wires were exclusively employed for the windings
of the ring-magnets, as no substance either magnetic or fusible
below 1200° was admissible.     These wires, after use in one
ring, were used again, with fresh insulation, in the next.
   Iron cores.—The cores of the third and fourth ring-magnets
(referred to in this paper as specimens A and B respectively),
were formed from strips, one chosen from each of two groups
of iron samples kindly procured for the author by Mr. R.
Jenkins from Messrs. Jos. Sankey and Sons, of Bilston. The
sample strips were                    1    cm. in width ; they were described                         as
follows:—
        Specimen              A.—“Charcoal Iron, No. 4 Quality; thick
                                    ness 02 in.”
               »              B.—“Best Transformer Quality 2& ; thick
                                    ness 014 in.” "
  These specimens proved, after careful annealing, to be
exceptionally good both as regards high permeability and low
hysteresis.
   Platinum   Thermometer Wire. Method of deducing Tem
peratures.—The    specimen of pure annealed platinum wire
used in the measurement of temperature was from the firm
of W. C. Heräus, of Hanau, near Frankfurt-a-M. The
same piece of wire was used in both the later ring-magnets.
Its diameter was 0453 cm.,                        its

the last annealing of specimen B, when a temperature of
1150° was reached and maintained for some time : the
resistance of the thermometer-wire rose (on this occasion as

wide was cut by a cold chisel out of the middle, leaving a
specimen consisting of two parallel strips each 4 mm. in width
joined at one end. The mean section of this double strip was
 determined by the specific gravity method.             It was then
           with mica and covered with asbestos as shown in

   The insulated thermometer-wire was next laid in the space
between the two iron strips, separated from them by slips of
mica laid crosswise, and covered over by a plain mica strip
(fig. 3).   The whole was then rolled up on a temporary
wooden form into a ring of four or five turns (fig. 4).
   Thus, though asbestos was used in the core as insulation,
it was the mica alone that was relied upon.
   The ends of the iron specimen were then bent so as to leave
the ring at right angles, and form a “stem ’’ about 10 cms. in
length. A portion of the same iron specimen resembling
this stem both in form and insulation, but only leading just
up to the ring and back (see fig. 6), was

   The heating wire, wound back on itself to avoid magnetizing
effect, was passed once or twice round the lower part of the
stem to prevent that local abstraction of heat to which the
stem would otherwise have given rise.
   The secondary winding was wound last of all; it being
possible in this way to secure better insulation, particularly
from the primary, from which even a small leakage into the
secondary was much more serious than any leakage from the
heating coil; for in the former case every ballistic throw due
to a change in the primary current would be associated with
a change of zero, while in the latter case no such change
would occur.
   The ring was afterwards successively covered with a layer
of mica, a layer of asbestos, a covering of iron-wire gauze,
and, finally, with a jacket consisting of three coverings of soft
asbestos millboard.     The iron gauze, which became red hot
when the ring was being used at high temperatures, was
placed there to intercept oxygen on       way its             in.

   The orygen-absorbing coil was, however, quite distinct from
this.   It consisted of two bare iron wires, connected in
                                 º
parallel, wound side by side on a cylindrical asbestos frame,
and surrounded by a loosely-fitting asbestos mantle.    Before
the experiments       were heated by an electric current to a
temperature at which they would readily absorb oxygen.
  The coverings of the ring-magnet formed a mass of asbestos
about 6 cm. in diameter; a small hole through them enabled
one to see what sort of temperature had been reached in
the middle of the ring.
   The coil for absorbing oxygen was then made fast to the
ring-magnet, and the leading wires brought through a cork
(previously boiled in linseed oil), which was then inserted into
..i.
the glass jar and covered with melted sealing-wax (fig. 5).
         the terminal wires were soldered to those leading
away to the rest of the apparatus.

have shown that though the susceptibility of that oxide rapidly
decreases with rise of temperature, yet it may be comparable
with that of iron, which is also very feebly magnetic in the
neighbourhood       of 1000°C. The author’s methods were,
however, not adapted to the determination of the magnetic
qualities of feebly magnetic bodies, and any determinations
by them of the permeability of the iron core when u < 10
have in any case little or no worth ; so that errors of such
values need hardly be considered.
    The only serious effect of the oxidation was to alter the
 sectional area of the iron. By directly measuring this section
 both before and after the experiments with each ring-magnet,
 uncertainties in the absolute values, both of the permeability
 and resistance measurements, were practically eliminated in
 all                observations, except that taken after annealing

annealing at these two temperatures is very marked ; the
iron having by the last annealing been rendered much more
susceptible  to weak magnetic fields. Annealed at 840°, the
maximum     permeability   at ordinary temperatures was about
4000 in a field of 1.84 C.G.S. units; annealed at 1150° this

  An examination of the B-H curves at various temperatures
(Nos. 6, 7, and 8) shows that as the temperature rises, the
initial slope of the curve increases and approaches more and
more nearly to the maximum slope. And the critical tempe
rature occurs just when they would coincide, i.e. when the
B-H curve would start from the origin with          maximum                         its

    In  paper read before the Institution          Civil Engineers      of

he made on a sample of transformer plate of similar thickness
and obtained from the same firm as the author's were.        The
maximum permeability was about 4500, while the hysteresis
varied from 740 down to 580 ergs for B= +4000; and
attention is drawn to these values as representing the best
iron both as regards high permeability and low hysteresis
which he had tested.     It is therefore of interest to note that
specimen B had after annealing at 1150° a maximum per
meability of over 4600 at ordinary temperatures, and a hys
teresis as calculated for B = +4000 of just under 500 ergs,
corresponding to a hysteresis loss of but '295 watts per lb. at
a frequency of 100        -.
                          The following values are taken from
the magnetization curve at 24°C.:—

   Between 0° and 200° the diminution of hysteresis with rise
of temperature is :08 per cent. per degree, when the limits of
induction are kept constant.
   W. Kunz " concludes from his experiments that for soft
iron the hysteresis is expressible as a linear function of the
temperature.       This is not in accordance with the author's
results.    The curves expressing this relation (Nos. 16) for
specimen B are far from straight, and show a decided dip at
about 500° corresponding to the minima which occur near
that temperature on the permeability-curves.
   III.    Resistance-Temperature Curves.—The    variations  of
 specific resistance with temperature are shown graphically on
curves 17 and 18.
   By taking  a sufficient number of observations (see Tables
XI.  and XII.) the author has been able to show that the
resistance-temperature curve undergoes no abrupt change of
direction at or near the critical temperature.   (Previous ob

  XXXIII.     Doublets and Triplets in the Spectrum produced by
     External Magnetic Forces.—(II.)"     By Dr. P. ZEEMAN f.
    13. Magnetic Triplet.—With the             of § 8 and with
  a very strong current and rightly-shaped conical poles
  succeeded in observing also the pure triplet (§ 5) with cad

  have used for the other characteristic phenomena. The field
  used was about 32,000 C.G.S. Using this strong field and
  looking without a nicol across the lines of force the cadmium
  line was seen tripled, i.e., broken up into three lines, separated
  by dark spaces. The existence of this triplet demonstrates, as
  it seems to me, irrefragably, and independently of the exami
  nation of the state of polarization, the magnetic nature of
                                                                                       j.

to the author) that now the three constituents of the triplet
partially overlapping one another, the maxima are conspicuous
and the inner part appears dark by contrast.       Thus there
would be no reversal in our case. This really seems to be so,
as is confirmed by the following experiment.      The above
mentioned hazy dark line being visible a nicol was placed in
the beam so as to get rid of light whose plane of polarization
is vertical; now only the bright line which emits horizontal
vibrations remains visible, but without the slightest trace of a
reversal.     For this observation it is of course very desirable
to use a   bright grating.                  I
                                 had no opportunity of obtaining a
measurement of the doublet to be seen along the lines of force.

Prof. Michelson's paper in the July number of the Phil.

opinion as to       particular advantages

   Supposing that the apparatus was arranged in a horizontal
plane, then the reflexions (under 45°) from the two plane
plates, one unsilvered and one semisilvered with a transparent
film of silver, must weaken especially the horizontal vibrations
and hence almost annihilate their influence.         For unsilvered
plates it is easily calculated that the    intensity   of horizontal
vibrations is under the circumstances stated weakened five or
six times more than that of the vertical ones.         This ratio is
of course somewhat     changed   by  the silver film.     How much
cannot be said without knowledge of further details.
    If Ihave indicated the real cause Michelson has observed
a case  analogous   to my triplet a, when a nicol is interposed in
such a position as to get rid of the horizontal vibrations.        Let
us  hope  that Prof. Michelson will soon    give   us his  opinion.

to have an intensely bright spark as a nucleus (fig. 1). On

ment for blowing it out. On developing the photographs it
was found that the discharge was an oscillatory one, for as
many as five or six clearly defined oscillations followed the
first, or pilot discharge.    The number of cells was then
doubled, and, although more difficulty was experienced with
the flaming discharge, oscillations were again obtained.

   On the supposition that each cell of the battery can be
regarded as a leaking condenser, and that it is equivalent in
capacity to a condenser shunted by a resistance equal to that
of the electrolyte, we can treat such a cell as a conducting
condenser under the influence during discharge of a periodic
current.  The analysis of the well-known case is as follows:–

In    the case I am considering the Planté cells evidently act

capacity of one cell,
                          n  would be the capacity of n cells.
    An examination of the photographs of the oscillations pro
duced by 2500 cells showed an apparent capacity of about
1000 electrostatic units.       Five thousand cells gave an apparent
capacity of about 500 units. The small apparent capacity C
results from the leaking of the condenser due to the conduction

 resistance save that of the tube and the battery in the circuit,
 and the light is examined in a revolving mirror by the eye,
 no oscillation or intermittence of light can be perceived on
 account of the flaming discharge through the rarefied gas.
     The oscillatory discharge may be said to be the common
 occurrence in nature in the case of electrical discharges, and
 the one-direction discharge the uncommon.              This has been
 expressed by the remark that electricity takes the path of
 least resistance, this common belief must be modified, however,
  under certain conditions of resonance; but in general nature
 avoids a unidirectional discharge.

the determined hysteresis loss in the iron sheet, in watts per
pound per 100 frequency, at a maximum induction during
the cycle of 2500 C.G.S. units.           Two processes are in
ordinary use for effecting this measurement.          The most
accurate but most tedious is by the employment of a ballistic
galvanometer and the graphical delineation of a number of
(B, H,) cycles. This method has the advantage that it can
be conducted with either small or large samples of iron,
but the reduction of the observations to give the required
hysteresis loss is very tedious ; and including the construction
of the necessary ring-coil, the actual observations, and the
reductions, a single determination of the hysteresis value of
an iron can hardly be carried out, even by a couple of
industrious workers, in less than a day.
   The method employed by Professor Ewing and Mr. F.
Holden of rotating a laminated specimen of the iron in a
magnetic field, or rotating a field round the specimen and
comparing the torque produced on the field-magnet or on
the specimen with that produced by a similar sample of iron
of known hysteretic value or else measuring it by a calibrated
torsion spring, is very much more rapid.       This last method

investigation was concerned with the study of the mode in
which this induction density varies from point to point in the
length of a bundle of iron strips or iron wire or steel rods of
various lengths and diameters, thus placed in the centre of a
long magnetizing solenoid.
    A magnetizing coil was prepared, wound on a paper tube,
 5.7 centimetres in internal diameter and 99 centimetres long.
 Ön this tube was wound, in three layers, a coil of 1235 turns
 of cotton-covered copper wire, '064 inch diameter or of
 No. 16 size S.W.G.         The resistance of this coil was
1-069 ohms at 15°       C.
  The number of turns per centimetre length of this coil was
12:47.   Hence since the interior central field is 47/10 times
the ampere  turns per unit of length of the coil, we have thus
the value of the field H in the central regions of the interior
of this bobbin given by the equation
                        H=15-66 A,
where A is the ampere current through the coil.
   The secondary or exploring coil consisted of a flat bobbin
wound up of silk-covered copper wire '0024 inch in diameter
and having 2000 turns; the thickness or length of the bobbin
being 0-7 centimetre and the external diameter about
4.5 centimetres.
   The exploring coil was wound on a circular ebonite former
having a rectangular hole in it so as to closely      the bundle        fit
of iron strips to      be
                   used, but          at

the variation of B". The first pair of diagrams represent the
result of varying the maximum induction density in the centre

         Magnetic Hysteresis loss in Straight Iron Strips.             271
    The above-mentioned        law as to the distribution of the
induction enables     us,  then,  to assign the corresponding value
of the maximum induction density.
    Unless this can be done, the mere mean hysteresis loss mea
surement is no practical use ".
    The operation of making the mean hysteresis measurement
is effected by a sensitive mirror bifilar electrodynamometer.
     This was constructed in the following way:—
     The fixed or series-coil consists of 90 turns of No. 16 S.W.G.
 cotton-covered copper wire wound in five layers on a rect
angular block of wood. The movable coil, or shunt-coil,
 consists of a rectangular coil of 20 turns of No. 24 S.W.G.
 wire, the turns being fastened together with silk and shellac.
 This movable coil embraces, without touching, the fixed coil,
 as in a Siemens dynamometer.          The movable coil is suspended
 by a bifilar suspension consisting of two silver wires 002 of
 an inch in diameter and 37 centim. long, fixed about 3 millim.
 apart. These wires are attached to the ends of the suspended
 coil, and serve to convey the shunt-current in and out of the
 coil. The movable coil carries a concave silver mirror by
 means of which a sharp image of an incandescent lamp
 filament is formed upon a scale at a fixed distance of 100
 centim. from the mirror.         A torsion-head carries the upper
 ends of the bifilar suspension, and serves to adjust the zero.
     In series with the shunt-coil is a high non-inductive
 resistance of 1000 ohms.
     The resistance of the thick-wire fixed coil of the wattmeter
 is 133 of an ohm, and the resistance of the shunt-coil and
 suspension, without the associated inductionless resistance, is
 11-7 ohms.
      When such a bifilar wattmeter is employed to measure
 electrical power, it can be shown that the deflexions of the
 movable coil, when not large, are strictly proportional to the
 power passing through the wattmeter, so that each scale
 division has an assignable power value, which in our case
 was almost exactly '01 of a watt per millimetre of scale.             The
 arrangement of circuits was then as shown in the diagram on
 p. 264. The long magnetizing coil above described was con
 nected in series with the fixed coil of the wattmeter, and also
 with a sensitive electrodynamometer or ammeter suitable for
     * Methods of measuring hysteresis loss by one observation of an instru
 ment have been suggested by other observers; but the practical value of
 these methods has been very small, because the investigators have not
 shown how the corresponding maximum value of the effective induction
 is to be obtained. The rule above given supplies this deficiency.

272         Prof.    J. A.     Fleming on a Method of determining
measuring small alternating currents of about an ampere                                                      or
less in value.
  The shunt-coil of the wattmeter was joined across the ends
of the long coil. Suitable resistances beyond controlled the
current.                                  -
  The process of measurement was then as follows:—A
bundle of straight iron strips was fitted with the secondary
coil at the effective point, viz., 56 of the half-length of the
bar from the centre. The bundle was slipped into the mag
netizing coil, and an alternating current sent through the
coil of such a magnitude (generally about 2 of an ampere)
as to give an induction density of not more than about
6000 C. G. S. units at the effective point.     The wattmeter
deflexion was then read. To    interpret this reading  the iron
strips were removed from the coil and another wattmeter
measurement made on the copper coil alone.                  As the removal
of the iron sends     up   the current    strength      by  decreasing the
inductance of the     circuit,  it is necessary    to readjust   the current
to the same value as before, and to know that value in amperes.
The resistance of the coil being known, and also the current
passing through            it,
                         we can calculate the power being taken
 up   in the  copper   coil alone for this standard current; and
hence know the power                  watts producing the observed
                                             in
wattmeter deflexion.
   The wattmeter         therefore calibrated
                           is                                        on

274      Prof.     J. A.    Fleming on a Method of determining
     In order      to   put the methodto a test, a very careful
determination     was made by the ballistic method of the
hysteresis loss of a sample of the transformer iron strip used.
A ring-coil was prepared, and a series of (B-H) cycles of
magnetization taken, and a hysteresis loop drawn, and from
this loop it was found that for this iron the hysteresis loss was
’25 watts per pound per 100 cycles per second, for a maximum
value of the induction density equal to 2500 C.G.S. units.
   Straight strips of exactly the same iron were then tested
by the method here described, which for shortness will be
called the “straight coil" method, and the results of these
tests with the iron in different conditions of hardness are
shown in the Tables III., IV., and V. (see end).
   It will be seen that the results of the “straight coil”
test with the wattmeter, as given in Table III., gave exactly
the same mean value for the hysteresis loss of the strip
when not bent and unbent, as did the calculations made
from the ballistic test, viz.: “25 watts per pound per                                      100
per maximum induction density of 2500. The difference in
the time of taking the tests                    is,
                                  however, immense.      very                              A

         Magnetic Hysteresis loss in Straight Iron Strips.                                   275
   Standardizing our wattmeter in this way with a continuous
current, we then made another set of hysteresis measure
ments, with 12 strips of perfectly new annealed transformer
strips (Sankey's), with the results shown in Table VI. Two
other sets of observations for hammered and hardened iron
are given in Tables VII. and VIII.
   As a matter of fact, in the above experiments in the obser
vations given in Tables III., IV., V., VII., and VIII., the
wattmeter was standardized by sending known and measured
currents through the copper coil and obtaining a wattmeter
constant by finding the deflexions corresponding to known
copper losses in the copper coil. Thus are found the following
figures, when using the wattmeter to measure power taken
up in the magnetizing coil alone:—

   Inthe case of the observations given in Table VI., we
employed the method of determining the wattmeter constant
by passing known                                 coils joined
                                     currents through           its                      up    in

moment find the wattmeter constant.
   The method described above has this great advantage that
the test can      made  be               on
                             fairly large samples        iron, and         of                  it

 282       Lord Rayleigh     on an Optical Device  for the
    In converting hysteresis losses from one maximum induc
 tion-density B to another by the aid of Steinmetz’s law, it is
 useful to have the arithmetic values, for different values of B,
 of the ratios of B"   to 2500”; since B-2500 C.G.S. units is
 generally taken as the standard induction-density in reference
 to hysteresis determinations.     The following table (Table IX.)
 gives these ratios with sufficient accuracy for all practical
 work. Thus, for instance, if the value of the hysteresis loss

XXXVI.       On an Optical Device for the Intensification       of
    Photographic Pictures.      By Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.*
        HETHER      from insufficient exposure or from other
          causes, it not unfrequently happens that a photo
graphic negative is deficient in density, the ratio of light
transmissions for the transparent and opaque parts being too
low for effective contrast.        In many cases an adequate

                    Intensification         of Photographic Pictures.                                       283
remedy is found in chemical processes of intensification, but
modern gelatine plates do not always lend themselves well
to this treatment.
   The method now proposed may be described as one of
using the negative twice over. Many years ago a pleasing
style of portrait was current dependent upon a similar
principle. A thin positive transparency is developed upon
a collodion plate by acid pyrogallol. Viewed in the ordinary
way by holding up to the light, the picture is altogether too
faint; but when the film side is placed in contact with paper
and the combination viewed by reflected light, the contrast
is sufficient. Through the transparent parts the paper is
seen with but little loss of brilliancy, while the opaque parts
act, as it were, twice over, once before the light reaches the
paper, and again after reflexion on           way     the eye.  its

giving     it  amoderate slope.     But the light reflected from the

the negative, and is obviated by using      the support   the                          for                        of

286                  Prof. J. Trowbridge    on
same    phenomenon could be observed in the ordinary voltaic
arc if it were not so exceedingly brilliant.
    I have lately studied the apparent resistance of the voltaic
arc in the following manner.      In the circuit B (fig. 1) of forty
                               Fig. 1.
large storage-coils giving 80 volts, was placed a low-resistance
choking-coil L, or coil of large self-induction.    To the carbon
terminals A between which the voltaic arc was produced were
led terminals of a condenser C. The latter was charged by a
step-up transformer T.       The oscillatory discharge of the
condenser was thus passed through the voltaic arc: and a
spark in a gap in the circuit of the condenser was photo
 graphed by the aid of a revolving mirror. The photograph
gave the number of oscillations in the circuit containing the
arc and the condenser. A curve was then plotted with the
number of oscillations as ordinates and the ohmic resistance
 of the circuit as abscissas.      It was thus found that the
apparent resistance of the voltaic arc was equivalent, in the
case   I considered, to a resistance of eight tenths of an ohm
 ('8 ohm). It was found, moreover, that an arc one quarter
of an inch long did not give more resistance than one one
 half an inch long. The apparent resistance, therefore, of the
voltaic arc does not follow Ohm's law.         I am led to believe
that the mechanism, so to speak, of the voltaic arc is as
follows:—A disruptive discharge accompanies a flaming dis
charge, and serves as a species of pilot-spark.         A variable

                     Electrical Discharges in Air.                       287
difference  of potential is necessary to sustain the disruptive
discharge; and this variable difference of potential makes
itself evident as an apparent change of resistance. The are
shortens or lengthens in obedience to the mechanism of the
 lamp which is employed.
    A family resemblance may be said to exist between all
 forms of electrical discharges in air; thus in the voltaic arc we
have a disruptive discharge combined with a flaming discharge.
 In general, this disruptive spark is oscillatory, even in the case
 where the voltaic are is produced by a dynamo-machine.
 When we extend our studies to the forms of electrical dis
 charges which are free, to a great extent, from the flaming
discharge, such as the disruptive    sparks from electrical
machines, Tesla and Thomson transformers, and the Planté
rheostatic machine, we are struck by their close resemblance
to the ordinary forms of lightning-discharge.              I have      lately
employed    in connexion with five thousand Planté cells a
Planté machine with thirty condenser-plates made of glass
one sixteenth of an inch in thickness, with a coated surface of
15 x 18 inches. Sparks 9 to 10 inches long can be very con
veniently studied by means of this apparatus; for a close
estimate of the difference of potential is possible, and the
spark-terminals do not change their sign during the ex
  eriments.   To the eye each spark seems to be surrounded
|.  a bright
nucleus.
              radiance or aureole of which it appears to be the
              In order to ascertain whether this radiance was an
actual    phenomenon,       I, employed a portrait-lens of large
aperture; and some of the results are exhibited in the accom
panying reproductions, which fail, however, to give the details
of the negative. Fig. 2 is a photograph of a spark taken with a
euryscope-lens, such as is commonly employed for landscape
work; this does not show any detail.               Figs. 3, 4, and 5
are  photographs      taken with a  Dallmeyer   portrait-lens   without
a diaphragm, and show, on the negatives, what may be con
sidered an aureole accompanying the spark            itsentire length;
furthermore, the oscillatory nature       of  the  sparks    shown
                                                            is              by
forked discharges which diverge from the main path                  theof

would show similar phenomenon, there could

  the apparent direction of each spark while another observer
  reversed the poles of the battery which charged the rheostatic
  machine.    On comparing the notes of the observers it was
  found that there was no agreement in regard to direction.
  This result was to be expected from the oscillatory nature of
  the discharges.     It may be that in the case of lightning the
  eye is forcibly impressed by the greater brightness of the
  positive terminal in the cloud, and the observer concludes that
  the flash has a unidirectional movement. The phenomenon
  is psychological rather than physical.
        When oscillatory sparks of the nature represented in
  figs. 3, 4, and 5 are passed through Crookes tubes of the
  focus-tube pattern, it was found that the photograph could
  be taken on plates exposed to the inclined surface of the
  platinum, both when it was made the anode and when it

formed      the kathode.     No difference in definition could     be
noticed ; there was, however, a great actinic difference.
Under the oscillatory nature of the leyden-jar discharge the
electrodes become alternately positive and negative.         Possibly
some of the want of definition noticed in Röntgen photographs
taken even with the aid of electrical machines may be due to
the fact that the oscillatory discharge does not always emanate
from the same point on the anode surface. A small anode
                  |
should therefore give sharper images than one of a large
surface.
    What is supposed to be a resistance in the case of the
voltaic arc,            in the modification of this as seen in dis
charges from          high-tension   transformers and in powerful
electric sparks, and presumably in lightning-discharges, is a
polarization which produces a variable difference of potential
 at the spark-terminals.
    The inconstancy of spark potentials has been shown by
Jaumann”.           In working with a revolving mirror it is found
that the       spark-terminals   have to be brightened in order to
 preserve the same spark-length. I was interested also to
 observe the effect of the surrounding medium upon the spark
 potentials.       Platinum terminals in sodium vapour showed
 the polarizable condition; but there did not appear to be an
 appreciable change in resistance apart from this polarization.
 The same was true when bromine vapour surrounded the
 spark-terminals. . In the case of Crookes tubes it is customary
 to apply heat if the discharge will not pass through the tube:
 and some makers provide a connecting receptacle filled with
 a substance which, on being volatilized, modifies the internal
 conditions of the tube. This modification is often spoken of
 as a diminution of resistance of the tube.        It should be more
 properly termed a method of modifying the state of polarization
 of  the electrodes.

coil and a small leyden jar only two of them are visible, and
they appear as short lines; but when using a large coil giving
a 4 to 10-inch spark and a large jar these lines appear long
and bright, and are easily seen.    One essential point is that
the electrodes should be thick and rounded off at the ends.
   The wave-lengths of the two brighter lines were measured
in two ways, viz. by a concave Rowland grating (25,000 lines
per inch) and by the ordinary prism-spectroscope.    With the
grating the two lines appeared rather weak, and were difficult
to measure even in the first-order spectrum.   The reference
lines I used were those of potassium, of wave-lengths 6911-2
and 69388 (Kaiser and Runge), which are obtained in the
arc. The relative distances were measured by means of an
 eyepiece-micrometer, which was fitted with a pointer.   Eight
 sets of measurements were made, and the wave-lengths cal
culated by simple proportion.   The values obtained were:—
                                7042-3,
                                705.6.7.
  With   a prism  of ordinary flint glass having an angle of 60°
the aluminium-lines appeared very bright and sharp.         For
reference I used lithium 6708:1 (Rowland), and the two
potassium-lines 7665-6 and 7699.3 (Eder and Valenta). Some
         &.
of the iron-lines would probably have been more convenient
for the purpose, but there was no arc-light available at the
time.             dispersion than that obtained by one prism
could not be employed very well on account of the great
distance between the Li and K lines, and therefore the values
for the wave-lengths cannot be considered very accurate, but
they are near enough for identification.    Ten sets of micro
meter-readings of the apparent distances were taken on three
different days, which agree fairly well with each other. From
the mean values of these readings the wave-lengths were
determined by the method of inverse squares and were found
to be as follows:–

The value for the first—the brighter one—agrees very well
with that obtained        by

closing the current.                 The following are the principal results which
he obtains:—
   1. The internal resistance of the elements used (cylindrical glass
vessels 2 cm. in diameter, distance between the electrodes 3–4 cm.)
varied at ordinary temperatures between 40 and 80 ohms accord
ing to the distance and magnitude of the electrodes.
   2. The resistance varied considerably with the temperature, being
trebled when it fell from 30° to 5°.
  3. No diminution of the internal resistance with the strength
and duration of the current could be ascertained.
  4. With stronger currents of 0.005 ampere (external resistance
200 ohms) polarization could be perceived even after 0:01 of a
second.  It increased but little during the first ten minutes, but
afterwards more and more rapidly.
   5. On opening the circuit the polarization diminished in a few
minutes to a small fraction.       Repeated short-circuiting through
only 50 ohms' external resistance for more than a minute did not
permanently injure the element.
   6. When an element was closed for 2 hours through 200 ohms,

              electromagnetic force was reduced almost         one half,                to

                                 some information as to the
nature of the Cathode  Rays.   The most diverse opinions are
held as to these rays; according to the almost unanimous
opinion of German physicists they are due to some process
in the aether to which—inasmuch as in a uniform magnetic
field their course is circular and not rectilinear—no pheno
menon hitherto observed is analogous: another view of these
rays is that, so far from being wholly aetherial, they are in fact
wholly material, and that they mark the paths of particles of
matter charged with negative electricity.        It would seem at
first sight that it ought not to be difficult to discriminate
between views so different, yet experience shows that this is
not the case, as amongst the physicists who have most deeply
studied the subject can be found supporters of either theory.
   The electrified-particle theory has for purposes of research
a great advantage over the aetherial theory, since it is definite
and       its
        consequences can        predicted; with the aetherial theory

unobserved phenomena in the aether, of whose laws we are
ignorant.
   The following experiments were made to test some of the
consequences of the electrified-particle theory.
               Charge carried by the Cathode Rays.
     If
      these rays are negatively electrified particles, then when
they enter an enclosure they ought to carry into it a charge
of negative electricity.    This has been proved to be the case
by Perrin, who placed in front of a plane cathode two coaxial
metallic cylinders which were insulated from each other : the
outer of these cylinders was connected with the earth, the
inner with a gold-leaf electroscope. These cylinders were
closed except for two small holes, one in each cylinder, placed
so that the cathode rays could pass through them into the
inside of the inner cylinder. Perrin found that when the rays
passed into the inner cylinder the electroscope received a
charge of negative electricity, while no charge went to the
electroscope when the rays were deflected by a magnet so
as no longer to pass through the hole.
   This experiment proves that something charged with nega
tive electricity is shot off from the cathode, travelling at right
angles to           it,
               and that this something       deflected         ismagnet;             by

are shot off from the    cathode;   they deny, however, that these
charged particles have any more               with the cathode rays

enough negative electricity went through the narrow slit into
the inner cylinder in one second to alter the potential of a
capacity   of    1.5 microfarads by 20 volts.              If   the rays were so

much bent by the magnet that they overshot the slits in the
cylinder, the charge passing into the cylinder fell again to a
very small fraction of       its
                           value when the aim was true. Thus
this  experiment  shows that however we twist and deflect the
cathode rays      by
                   magnetic forces, the negative electrification
follows the same path        as
                           the rays, and that this negative elec
trification isindissolubly connected with the cathode rays.
   When the rays are turned               by
                                      the magnet             pass    so   as   to
through the slit into the inner cylinder, the deflexion       the               of

     Deflerion of the Cathode Rays by an Electrostatic Field.
    An objection very generally urged against the view that
the cathode rays are negatively electrified particles, is that
hitherto no deflexion of the rays has been observed under a
small electrostatic force, and though the rays are deflected
when they pass near electrodes connected with sources of large
|.
differences of potential, such as induction-coils or electrical
machines, the deflexion in this case is regarded by the sup
          of the aetherial theory as due to the discharge passing
  etween the electrodes, and not primarily to the electrostatic
field.    Hertz made the rays travel between two parallel
plates of metal placed inside the discharge-tube, but found
that they were not deflected when the plates were con
nected with a battery of storage-cells; on repeating this
experiment     I  at first got the same result, but subsequent
experiments showed that the absence of deflexion is due to
the conductivity conferred on the rarefied gas by the cathode
              º
rays.    On measuring this conductivity it was found that it
diminished very rapidly as the exhaustion increased; it seemed
then that on trying Hertz's experiment at very high exhaus
tions there          be a chance of detecting the deflexion of the
cathode rays by an electrostatic force.
    The apparatus used is represented in fig. 2.
                                Fig. 2.
    The rays from the cathode C pass through a slit in the
 anode A, which is a metal plug fitting tightly into the tube
 and connected with the earth; after passing through a second
 slit in another earth-connected metal plug B, they travel
between two parallel aluminium plates about 5 cm. long
by 2 broad and at a distance of 1.5 cm. apart; they then fall
on the end of the tube and produce a narrow well-defined
phosphorescent patch.        A scale pasted on     the outside of
the tube serves to measure the deflexion           of this patch.  s

 At high exhaustions         the rays were deflected when the two
  aluminium       plates  were connected with the terminals of a
  battery of small storage-cells; the rays were depressed
  when the upper plate was connected with the negative
  pole of the battery, the lower with the positive, and raised
  when the upper plate was connected with the positive, the
  lower with the negative pole.              The deflexion was propor
...tional to the difference of potential between the plates, and                                 I
  could detect the deflexion when the potential-difference was
  as small as two volts.       It was only when the vacuum was a
 good one that the deflexion took place, but that the absence
  of deflexion is due to the conductivity of the medium is
  shown by what takes place when the vacuum has just arrived
  at the stage at which the deflexion begins.                At this stage
  there is a deflexion of the rays when the plates are first
  connected with the terminals of the battery, but if this
  connexion is maintained the patch of phosphorescence gradu
  ally creeps back to               its
                              undeflected position.       This     just what         is
  would    happen      the
                         ifspace  between the     plates were     conductor,     a
   though very bad one, for then the positive and negative ions
           a
   between the plates would slowly diffuse, until the positive plate
  became coated with negative ions, the negative plate with
   positive ones; thus the electric intensity between the plates
  would vanish and the cathode rays                              be
                                                    free from electrostatic
   force. Another illustration          this     of

  deflexion     ofthe cathode   rays, but the medium under the large
  electromotive force breaks down every now and then and                                        a
   bright discharge passes between the plates; when this occurs
   the phosphorescent patch produced                             by

       Conductivity of a Gas through which Cathode Rays
                          are passing.
   The conductivity of the gas was investigated by means of the
apparatus shown in fig. 2. The upper plate D was connected
with one terminal of a battery of small storage-cells, the other
terminal of which was connected with the earth ; the other
plate E was connected with one of the coatings of a condenser
of one microfarad capacity, the other coating of which was to
earth; one pair of quadrants of an electrometer was also
connected with E, the other pair of quadrants being to earth.
When the cathode rays are passing between the plates the
two pairs of quadrants of the electrometer are first connected
with each other, and then the connexion between them was
broken.   If the space between the plates were a non-conductor,
the  potential  of the pair of quadrants not connected with the
earth would remain zero and the needle of the electrometer
would not move;              if,

one minute is the quantity required to raise 1 microfarad to
the potential-difference shown by the curve.        The upper and
lower curve relates to the case when the upper plate is con
nected with the negative and positive pole respectively of the
battery.                                                            .
     Even when there is no initial difference of potential between
 the plates the lower plate acquires a negative charge from
the impact on it of some of the cathode rays.                      -
     We see from the curve that the current between the plates
 soon reaches a value where it is only slightly affected by an
increase in the potential-difference between the plates; this is
 a feature common to conduction through gases traversed by
 Röntgen rays, by uranium rays, by ultra-violet light, and, as
 we now see, by cathode rays. The rate of leak is not greatly
 different whether the upper plate be initially positively or
 negatively electrified.
     The current between the plates only lasts for a short time;
 it ceases long before the potential of the lower plate ap
 proaches that of the upper. Thus, for example, when the
 potential of the upper plate was about 400 volts above that of
 the earth, the potential of the lower plate never rose above
 6 volts: similarly, if the upper plate were connected with the
 negative pole of the battery, the fall in potential of the lower
 plate was very small in comparison with the potential-difference
 between the upper plate and the earth.
     These results are what we should expect if the gas between
 the plates and the plug B (fig. 2) were a very much better
 conductor than the gas between the plates, for the lower
 plate will be in a steady state when the current coming to it
 from the upper plate is equal to the current going from it to
 the plug: now if the conductivity of the gas between the
 plate and the plug is much greater than that between the
 plates, a small difference of potential between the lower plate
 and the plug will be consistent with a large potential-difference
 between the plates.
     So far we have been considering the case when the pressure
 is as high as is consistent with the cathode rays reaching the
 end of the tube; we shall now go to the other extreme and
 consider the case when the pressure is as low as is consistent
  with the passage of a discharge through the bulb. In this
 case, when the plates are not connected with the battery we
  get a negative charge communicated to the lower plate, but
 only very slowly in comparison with the effect in the previous
  case.   When the upper plate is connected with the negative
  pole of a battery, this current to the lower plate is only
  slightly increased even when the difference of potential is as
  much as 400 volts: a small potential-difference of about

300            Prof.      J. J.     Thomson on Cathode Rays.
20 volts seems slightly to decrease the rate of leak. Potential
differences much exceeding 400 volts cannot be used, as
though the dielectric between the plates is able to sustain
them for some little time, yet after a time an intensely bright
arc flashes across between the plates and liberates so much
gas as to spoil the vacuum. The lines in the spectrum of this
glare are chiefly mercury lines;                 passage leaves veryits
peculiar markings             on
                          the aluminium plates.
  If    the upper plate was charged positively, then the negative
charge communicated            the lower plate was diminished, and
                                     to
stopped when the potential-difference between the plates was
about     20 volts; but     the lowest pressure, however great (up

                            the facts are consistent with the view
 that the effects are due        the negatively electrified particles

deflexion of the rays produced by a magnet diminishes, or at
any rate the deflexion of the rays when the phosphorescence
is a maximum diminishes.                          If
                                     an air-break is inserted an
effect of the same kind is   produced.
   In the experiments with different gases, the pressures were
as high as was consistent with the appearance of the phos
phorescence on the glass, so as to ensure having as much as
possible of the gas under consideration in the tube.
   As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity,
are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively
electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the
way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified
body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape
from the conclusion that they are charges of negative elec
tricity carried by particles of matter.          The question next
arises, What are these particles 2 are they atoms, or mole
cules, or matter in a still finer state of subdivision ?           To

   To measure these quantities,       have used tubes  I    three                                of

     The value of I, i.e., Hp, where p is the curvature of the
 path of the rays in a magnetic field of strength H was found
as follows:–The tube was fixed between two large circular
coils placed parallel to each other, and separated by a distance
equal to the radius of either; these coils produce a uniform
 magnetic field, the strength of which is got by measuring
 with an ammeter the strength of the current passing through
them. The cathode rays are thus in a uniform field, so that
their path is circular. Suppose that the rays, when deflected
 by a magnet, strike against the glass of the tube at E
                               Fig. 5.
(fig. 5), then,  if p is the radius of the circular path of the
rawsyS,

                           2p=             ;
 thus,   if we measure     CE  and   AC  we have the means of
determining the radius of curvature          of the path of the
                                                       -
r:l W.S.
    The determination of p is rendered to some extent uncertain,
in consequence of the pencil of rays spreading out under the
action of the magnetic field, so that the phosphorescent patch
at E is several millimetres long; thus values of p differing
appreciably, from each other will be got by taking E at
different points of this phosphorescent patch.      Part of this
patch was, however, generally considerably brighter than the
rest; when this was the case, E was taken as the brightest
point ; when such a point of maximum brightness did not
exist, the middle of the patch was taken for E. The uncer
tainty in the value of p thus introduced amounted sometimes
to about 20 per cent.; by this I mean that if we took E first
at one extremity of the patch and then at the other, we should
get values of p differing by this amount.
    The measurement of Q, the quantity of electricity which
enters the inner cylinder, is complicated by the cathode rays
making the gas through which they pass a conductor, so that
though the insulation of the inner cylinder was perfect when
the rays were off, it was not so when they were passing
through the space between the cylinders; this caused some
of the charge communicated to the inner cylinder to leak
away so that the actual charge given to the cylinder by the
cathode rays was larger than that indicated by the electrometer.

              Prof. J. J. Thomson    on Cathode Rays.           305
To make the error from this      cause   as small as possible, the
inner cylinder was connected to the largest capacity available,
1.5 microfarad, and the rays were only kept on for a short
time, about 1 or 2 seconds, so that the alteration in potential
of the inner cylinder was not large, ranging in the various
experiments from about 5 to 5 volts.          Another reason why
it is necessary to limit the duration of the rays to as short
a time as possible, is to avoid the correction for the loss
of heat from the thermo-electric junction by conduction along
the wires ; the rise in temperature of the junction was of
the order 2°C. ; a series of experiments showed that with
the same tube and the same gaseous pressure Q and W were
proportional to each other when the rays were not kept on
 too long.
    Tubes of this kind gave satisfactory results, the chief draw
 back being that sometimes in consequence of the charging up
 of the glass of the tube, a secondary discharge started from
 the cylinder to the walls of the tube, and the cylinders were
 surrounded by glow ; when this glow appeared, the readings
 were very irregular ; the glow could, however, be got rid of by
 pumping and letting the tube rest for some time. The results
      with this tube are given in the Table under the heading
 #.
Tube 1.
    The second type of tube was like that used for photographing
 the path of the rays (fig. 4); double cylinders with a thermo
 electric junction like those used in the previous tube were
 placed in the line of fire of the rays, the inside of the bell
jar was lined with copper gauze connected with the earth.
 This tube gave very satisfactory results; we were never
 troubled with any glow round the cylinders, and the readings
 were most concordant; the only drawback was that as some
 of the connexions had to be made with sealing-wax, it was
 not possible to get the highest exhaustions with this tube, so
that the range of pressure for this tube is less than that for
 tube 1. The results got with this tube are given in the Table
 under the heading Tube 2.
    The third type of tube was similar to the first, except that
the openings in the two cylinders were made very much
smaller; in this tube the slits in the cylinders were replaced
 by small holes, about 1.5 millim. in diameter.    In consequence
 of the smallness of the   openings,  the  magnitude  of the effects
 was very much reduced ; in order to get measurable results
 it was necessary to reduce the capacity of the condenser in
connexion with the inner cylinder to 15 microfarad, and to
make the galvanometer exceedingly sensitive, as the rise in
temperature of the thermo-electric junction was in these
experiments only about 5° C. on the average.           The results

   It will be noticed that the value of m/e is considerably
greater for Tube 3, where the opening is a small hole, than
for Tubes 1 and 2, where the opening is a slit of much greater
area.   I am of opinion that the values of u<U+017F>e got from Tubes
1 and 2 are too small, in consequence of the leakage from the
inner cylinder to the outer by the gas being rendered a con
ductor by the passage of the cathode rays.
   It will be seen from these tables that the value of m/e is
independent of the nature of the gas. Thus, for the first tube
                for                40x 10",                 for                        10",

  Experiments were tried with electrodes made    iron instead                 of
ofaluminium; this altered the appearance  the discharge and              of

described later on.
  In   all the preceding experiments, the cathode rays were by
first deflected from the cylinder       magnet, and     was then
                                                            a                      it
found that there was no deflexion either of the electrometer or
the galvanometer,                 so
                            that the deflexions observed were
entirely due      the cathode rays
                  to                  when the glow mentioned

occupied by the plates, the distance between the coils was
equal to the radius of either. The mean value of the magnetic
force over the length l was determined in the following way:
a narrow coil C whose length was l, connected with a ballistic
galvanometer, was placed between the coils; the plane of the
windings of C was parallel to the planes of the coils; the cross
section of the coil was a rectangle 5 cm. by 1 cm.     A given
current was sent through the outer coils and the kick
a of the galvanometer observed when this current was
reversed.  The coil C was then placed at the centre of two
very large coils, so as to be in a field of uniform magnetic
force : the current through the large coils was reversed
and the kick 8 of the galvanometer again observed ; by com
paring a and B we can get the mean value of the magnetic
force over a length              l;    this was found to be

where t is the current flowing through the coils.
   A series of experiments was made to see if the electrostatic
deflexion was proportional to the electric intensity between the
plates; this was found to be the case.         In the following
experiments the current through the coils was adjusted so that
the electrostatic deflexion was the same as the magnetic :—

 the region outside the plates; in this region the magnetic
 force will be in the opposite direction to that between the
 plates, and will tend to bend the cathode rays in the opposite
 direction : thus the effective value of H will be smaller than
 the value used in the equations, so that the values of m/e are
 larger, and those of v less than they would be if this correction
 were applied. This method of determining the values of m/e
 and v is much less laborious and probably more accurate than
 the former method ; it cannot, however, be used over so wide
 a range of pressures.
    From these determinations we see that the value of m/e is
 independent of the nature of the gas, and that        value 10-7                       its

at the corners of a hexagon, but divide into two systems, con
sisting of 1 in the middle surrounded by 5 at the corners of a
pentagon. For 8 we have two in the inside and 6 outside;
this arrangement in two systems, an inner and an outer, lasts
up to 18 magnets. After this we have three systems: an inner,
a middle, and an outer; for a still larger number of magnets
we have four systems, and so on.

   Now suppose that a certain roperty is associated with two
magnets forming a group by                               we should have this
property with 2 magnets, again with 8 and 9, again with 19
and 20, and again with 34, 35, and so on.                       If we regard the
system of magnets as a model of an atom, the number of
magnets being proportional to the atomic weight, we should
have this property occurring in elements of atomic weight 2,
(8, 9), 19, 20, (34, 35). Again, any property conferred by
three magnets forming a system by themselves would occur
with atomic weights 3, 10, and 11; 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24;
35, 36, 37 and 39; in fact, we should have something quite
analogous to the periodic law, the first series corresponding
to the arrangement of the magnets in a single group, the
second series to the arrangement in two groups, the third
series in three groups, and so on.

   The velocity of the cathode rays is variable, depending upon
the potential-difference between the cathode and anode, which
is a function of the pressure of the gas—the velocity increases
as the exhaustion improves; the measurements given above
show, however, that at               all
                           the pressures   which experiments           at
were made the velocity exceeded 10" cm./sec.   This velocity                                       is
much greater than the value                10' which    2x     previously          I

    velocity through the aether, the electromagnetic field, when

THE       effect upon polarized light of a transparent medium in
a magnetic field.
  The observation                    of an effect upon polarized light in a
transparent   medium in an electric field, suggests a similar
condition in a magnetic field. The state of polarization of
such media should affect, to a greater or less extent, the
i.
propagation of polarized light.       In magnetically polarized
media, the Faraday effect is always present except for propa
  ation exactly at right angles to the lines of force, a con
        impossible to realize for any finite stream of light.
Even with very small divergence of the rays this might mask
any new effect. In any case the Faraday effect must be
eliminated.
   The magnet used was forged from Norway iron. The cores
are 8 in. in diameter and 36 in. long.    These are bolted to a

narrow beam of light, the divergence was sufficient to intro
duce this effect, notwithstanding the direction was shifted so
as to make the mean direction of the rays as near normal to
the field as possible.     Difficulty was experienced both from
depolarization at the sides of the plate and from imperfect
annealing of the glass, so that this form of the experiment had
to be abandoned.
    An estimate of the Faraday effect for a small bundle of
rays   will show the impossibility of eliminating this factor in
this way. Assume for Faraday glass, no=1:76, and a rotary
power of bp = 2 x 10-" radians per cm. If H=5250 the rota
tion per cm. is poa 6° approximately. Allowing 200 cm. for the
total path of ray and 1 cm, aperture, we have, from Verdet's
law, the total rotation for the most divergent ray
                      p=6° x 200 x 1005=6°,
or an average of 3°.     Taking the sensibility of the instrument
at 0.1°, the aperture must evidently be 003 cm. to eliminate
 the Faraday effect in this arrangement.
 ...
    It is evident from Verdet’s law, p=pocos 6, that p changes
 sign when 6 passes through T/2 and 37/2, hence if a ray is

    This condition was                  in the following experiment.
 Two   cylinders  of Faraday     glass,    no=1:76, each 22 cm. long
 and 2.4 cm. in diameter were          placed     end to end in the field
 and polarized light was sent                    the system and reflected

back by a mirror, adjusted so as to be parallel to the lines of
force.     The analyser showed the presence of depolarization
in the glass cylinders due to accidental double refraction,
although the same had been carefully selected and annealed.
No change in the two halves of the field of view could be
 detected when the magnet was excited.           The difficulty of
 obtaining the highest sensibility with glass on account of
     .
 depolarization led to the following experiment with a liquid.
        Plate IV., DE is the tube 48 cm. long, containing the
 liquid to be examined, surrounded with a water-jacket
 mounted between the poles of the electromagnet.        The faces
 of the latter were 50-7 cm.   by 8.7 cm., accurately planed,  and
 7-3 cm. apart and placed as near parallel as possible, so as to
 insure a uniform field of parallel lines of force. The optical
 system and tube was mounted on an arm A, 70 in. long,
 pivoted at P to a frame support resting on the bed-plate of
 the magnet.      The other end of the arm carrying the analyser
 and   telescope  rested on the carrier S, which could be moved
 laterally by the micrometer screw M. Sunlight passing
 through the lens R was brought to a focus at L after bein
 reflected by the right-angle prism P. The ray was then pass
 through the tube four times by reflexion at the mirrors E and D,
 making a total distance of 198 cm.; and finally through the
telescope T, which formed an image of the half-shade a little
in front of the analyser N. This image was observed with
the small telescope t, which could be moved in the direction
of the ray by the micrometer screw m. The “Lippich“ L
could be rotated so that the ray rr could be polarized in any
plane with respect to the magnetic field.      The divided circle
of the analyser could be read by the microscopes ce to 003°.
On account of diffused light and internal reflexion, the ray
was cut down by successive diaphragms to about 1 cm.
diameter.
    In  some  of the experiments the optical arrangements shown
at R, and R, were used. In the former the ray, after passing
through the Lippich L, was reflected by a double right-angle
prism in the direction r. This prism was found, however, to
depolarize slightly, and did not give as great a sensibility as
R. In R, the return ray passed within the mounting of the
                                                 §:
Lippich, close to the nicols. This was used with small tubes
of liquids with only two passages of the ray, and with less
than half the air-gap between the poles.                definition
was obtained with this system, but the arrangement R, on
account of the greater length of the ray, gave the highest
sensibility.
    The liquid used was a saturated solution of iodide of

           a Dielectric Normal to the Lines  of Force.        345
  otassium and red iodide of mercury (no=1.69 approximately).
  he transmitted light was of a deep orange colour.      In order
to obtain good definition, water from the water-mains was
allowed to run through the jacket for a couple of days, and
the tube was taken out and rolled at intervals.
   Under the most favourable conditions of sunlight and
homogeneity of the liquid, four observations were obtained
during the course of a month, in which the sensibility of the
apparatus was such that 0.1° change in the plane of polariza
tion could with certainty be detected.     In other observations
•02° could usually be observed.
   In making     the observations, the heliostat was adjusted
until the image of the sun appeared in the centre of the field
of the polarizer, and the analyser was then adjusted until each
half of the field appeared of the same intensity.    The magnet
was then excited and, if any change of intensity occurred,
the arm A was shifted by the screw M until the two halves
became of the same intensity again.       The current was then
reversed and the same adjustments made until no effect could
be detected when the current was reversed.       In this case the
mirror E was evidently made parallel to the lines of force.
   By rotating the polarizing combination, the same observa
tions could be made with the plane of polarization making
different angles with the lines of force. Observations were
made over a range of 90°, but the chief ones were those at
45° with the lines of force; of these four were obtained with
a sensibility of 0.1°. The current used was generally 9 amperes,
but in one case it reached 40 amperes, but this probably did
not increase the field by more than 50 per cent.
   In no case could an effect be observed after the neutral
position was obtained, indicating that there is no double
refraction within the limits of the observations.
   During each experiment a determination of the sensibility
was made.      This was effected in two different ways. The
first was to determine the rotation of the analyser which
would just produce a perceptible change in the two halves of
the field.    The second was to shift the arm A when the
current was on and read the micrometer screw M. The pitch
of this screw was 1/32 of an inch. 1/40 of a turn of M
could certainly be detected during several of the most
favourable observations.      These two independent methods
serve as a check on each other.       An iris diaphragm placed
in front of the telescope T allowed the aperture to be varied
to give the best results. The following schedule illustrates
                                   :-

one or both of the two methods

      Knowing the specific rotary power pn of the liquid and the
intensity   of the magnetic field, the rotation p by the latter
method may be calculated from Verdet’s law.       4 was deter
mined by wrapping some 25 turns of wire about the tube,
and correcting for the ends (1992) and observing the double
rotation (1° 24') of the plane of polarization produced by a
reversal of the current (11.73 amp.), the ray being from
sodium light and traversing the tube once.
   Substituting in Verdet's equation, we have

   The intensity of the field H was measured with a spiral of
bismuth whose constant was known.           With an exciting
current of 9 amp.,  H was found to be 2600 C.G.S. units. One

 different colours.
      The best method             I  have yet found of making such films is
 to    pour      a little alcoholic solution of required concentration
  (found by trial) upon a piece of glass, then to wave the glass
 through the flame of a Bunsen burner.                          The fuchsine does
 not     melt;       but the alcohol is         rapidly    removed and leaves an
 amorphous film of the dye.                  If  the concentration and quantity
 are rightly chosen, the film has the appearance of a brilliant
 mirror of variegated colour. The following table gives the
 colour of the film as seen by reflected light at normal                             in
 cidence. The colours are given in order of increasing thick
 ness of film. The Roman numerals are used for reference
 only; they are not a measure of the thickness of the film:—

than the surface-colour of fuchsine in air, but a comparison of
the two columns of Table A shows that this is not the com
plete explanation of their difference.
    From Table B we see that the maxima and minima in
blue light do not occur at the same thickness of film as seen
directly or through the glass.                 In a transparent film there is
a maximum or minimum at zero thickness.                      This is not the
case with fuchsine films observed in yellow, green, or blue
light.    The peculiarities of Table B can be expressed by
saying that the interference-bands as seen from the glass side
are displaced towards the thicker end of the film, the dis
placement increasing as we go from the red to the blue end
of the spectrum. The second column shows the displacement
of the first minimum in yellow and green light and of the
first minimum and maximum in blue light.
    If the film is viewed directly the bands in blue light are
displaced in the opposite direction.                  As the displacement is
towards the thin end of the film the first minima disappear.
    Table B shows a very large wave-length for blue light in
fuchsine compared with that for red.
    This is in agreement with the recent measurements of
Pflüger *, who finds a much larger anomalous dispersion
than Wernicket.
    This is no doubt due to the fact that my films, like those
of Pflüger, are very free from alcohol.                    Some films which
I  have kept for two years show no sign of change.
    §4. The suggestion might be made that the maxima and
minima observed in these highly absorbing films are not mainly
due to the reflexion at the back surface.                     To test this    I
smeared some oil on the film and viewed it from the back of
the glass on which the fuchsine is deposited.                    In the very
thin films there is no longer a diminution of illumination with
increase of thickness.           The minima of Table B and the
peculiar colouring of Table               A,     2nd column, thickness      II.
disappear.     The maxima and minima in blue light are also
displaced towards the thin end of the film.                  If  we turn over
the glass and view the film through the oil, the maxima and
minima are also displaced, but in the opposite direction.                 The
extent of the displacement is such as to make the maxima
and minima occur at approximately the same thickness of

very rough observations that this is the case, it seems that
a thin plate of fuchsine placed between two transparent
media of equal refrangibility is free from the peculiarities of

  § 5. The Change of Phase on Reflexion: Glass-Fuchsine.
  Wernicke * and Potier f have exhibited the change of
phase which occurs on reflexion from glass to fuchsine.
Potier f gives the following measurements:—
  8=retardation on reflexion from crown-glass to fuchsine.

   Wernicke's     results are not in exact agreement, but he
                     $
also finds a gradual increase of acceleration as we pass from
the blue to the red end of the spectrum, starting from nearly
0 at the blue end and amounting to trat the red end.
   Potier made similar measurements, using a flint-glass of
high index, 1.96, which he says is higher than the index for
any ray in fuchsine.       He finds a maximum acceleration
                   in the green between D and E, falling

     Thus far we have considered the propagation   of waves
along an unlimited series of bodies.   we suppose that the           If
total number is m and that they form a closed chain, ºr must
be such that

   When the chain, composed of a limited series of bodies,

becomes more complicated. A simple example is that treated

362                   Mr. E.     J.    Nanson on the Relations                             between
the analogue of radiating bodies is to be sought at all in
ordinary mechanical or acoustical systems vibrating about
equilibrium. For the latter, even when gyratory terms are
admitted, give rise to equations involving the square of the
frequency; and it is only in certain exceptional cases, e.g.
(31), that the frequency itself can be simply expressed. On
 the other hand, the formulae and laws derived from observation
 of the spectrum appear to introduce more naturally the first
 power of the frequency.       For example, this is the case with
 Balmer's formula.       Again, when the spectrum of a body
 shows several doublets, the intervals between the components
correspond closely to a constant difference of frequency,
and could not be simply expressed in terms of squares of
frequency.     Further, the remarkable law, discovered inde
pendently   by Rydberg and by Schuster, connecting the con
vergence frequencies of different series belonging to the same
 substance, points in the same direction.
   What particular conclusion follows from this consideration,

we obtain four different formulae each expressing A as a
rational function of the coaxial first minors.

         title sufficiently indicates the aim of the book. Students
THE   who wish for a thorough discussion of the various points which
turn up must go to such treatises as those of Boole, Forsyth, and
Johnson.      To these classics Dr. Murray gives ample references, as
well as to numerous other works and original memoirs. The work,
which we have read with considerable interest, assumes in the
reader little more than a knowledge of the fundamental formulae
of integration, and brings in many practical applications well
adapted for the class of students for whom it is intended.           The
rigorous proofs of many of the theorems are relegated to an
appendix to be read when some familiarity with the subject has
been acquired.     An interesting feature are the numerous historical
and   biographical   notes scattered throughout the text, and there
                                                                                               of its

                               well selected examples,   many      which
are worked out. We have not tested these exercises, but               the                               in

XLIX.     The Surface-Tension of certain Dilute Aqueous Solu
   tions, determined by the Method of Ripples.         By N. ERNEST
   DoRSEY, Ph.D."
                           Introduction.
     REVIOUS      observers have found that the surface-tension
       of most aqueous solutions is a linear function of the
concentration ; but they have worked on no solutions more
dilute than about one-half normal.        (A normal solution is one
that contains in one litre of the solution as many grams of the
salt as there are units in the molecular weight of the salt, the
molecular weight of hydrogen being taken as two.)             It seems
therefore desirable to  determine,   if possible, the surface-tension
of more dilute solutions; and this work was undertaken at the
suggestion of Prof.   J.  S. Ames in the spring of 1895, for the
purpose of studying solutions as dilute as possible.          Most of
the time since then has been spent in studying the various
methods, and in perfecting the method of ripples, which
appeared to offer fewer theoretical objections than any other.
   The arrangement of apparatus finally adopted gives an
average departure from the mean of several observations of
not more than one-seventh of one per cent. Though different
samples of water may give results that differ among themselves
by more than this amount, still in the entire series of twenty
one samples of water the average departure of a single obser
vation from the mean was but one-fifth of one per cent. This
compares very favourably with the results obtained by any
other method.

solution-air and the solution-glass surfaces change with the
concentration of the solution, so that the results obtained
involve two changes which cannot be separated. This renders
the interpretation of the results very difficult.
      Jäger used             a method depending                on the relation between
the diameter of a capillary tube and the distance it must be
immersed in the liquid in order that the same air-pressure
may cause steady streams of bubbles of the same size
to issue from it and from another tube of known diameter,
immersed to a fixed depth.       He determined this relation
empirically from experiments on water; and he accepted the
results of Brunner and of Wolf as correct.
   Quincke's work on flat bubbles has been discussed in several
papers, and seems to be not very satisfactory.    From this we
see  that, excepting the work done by  Sentis and by Klupathy,
the determinations of the surface-tensions of solutions are not
all that can be desired.
    Sentis employed an entirely different method, and one that
appears to be very free from objections.        He draws the liquid
up into a capillary tube; then removes the tube from the liquid,
and allows the liquid to run out so as to form a drop around the
end of the tube. This drop supports a liquid column of a certain
length in the tube. He then measures the maximum diameter
of the drop, focusses a microscope on the meniscus in the tube,
and slowly raises below the tube a beaker of the liquid. When
the liquid in the beaker reaches the drop, the column in the tube
falls; the position of the beaker is now noted, and it is then
again slowly raised until the meniscus in the tube has come
back to          its
              previous position, and the position       the beaker            of                      is
again noted. The vertical distance between these two positions

372       Dr. N. Ernest Dorsey on the Surface-Tension                 of
 mentioned Lord Rayleigh's appeared to be the most promising,
 and is the one finally adopted.
                            Method     of Ripples.
     This method is based on the relation between the surface
 tension of a liquid and the velocity of propagation on its
 surface of a train of small waves of given period.                   This was
 deduced by Lord Kelvin " for the case of infinitely small
 waves on the surface of a perfect liquid of given depth.                   His
 formula is

 Here V is the velocity of propagation; A is the wave-length ;
 T  is the surface-tension ; p is the density ; h is the depth of
 the liquid ; and g is the acceleration of gravity.                If  n is the
 frequency of the waves, we can write this equation thus:

where p' is the density of the air in contact with the surface.
For the accuracy obtained in measuring A, the first and
simpler formula is sufficiently exact.
   Of the terms on the right of these equations, the first is
much the larger for small waves.     Hence the value calculated
for T will be proportional to the cube of the wave-length and
to the square of the frequency.   Here is the first objection to
this method.   The value found for T will be only one-third as
accurate as the measurement of the wave-length, and one-half
as accurate as the determination of the frequency.       Again,
since the formulae are deduced for waves of    infinitely small
amplitudes, we must use very moderate vibrations, and these
are difficult to measure.
   Several, among whom we need mention only Matthiessen,
Riess, and Ahrendt, have attempted to test experimentally the
extreme accuracy of Lord Kelvin’s formula.

point. This      the method employed
                       is                     Ahrendt". He found            by
that the value      the surface-tension calculated from the ob
                            of

                    or                  Matthiessen found that the

      C.
       M. Smith      employed     this method for determining the
surface-tension
                             f
                      mercury, but obtained very erratic results.

Lord Rayleigh thinks,      f                       he
                                  obtained waves due          the sub                              to
 octave     of      his
               fork, and these are almost sure      have too large                      to
 an amplitude.
    W. Ochsé attempted
                    by                             to
                               determine the surface-tension                                                      of
                        ripples.    He measured the interference

 solutions    means   š
pattern     of
           two series    circular waves,    Riess and Matthiessen       as
had done; his waves had         large amplitude,   a assumed that                        he
the density did not enter into the equation, and       used rather                           he
concentrated solutions. His measurements         the wave-lengths                  of
are quite rough,                so
                      that the results have but little value even
when corrected for the density.
   From this       seen that the formula has not been disproved;
                     it    is
and the fact that Lord Rayleigh obtained the same value for
the surface-tension                    of

work   agrees within his   experimental  error with Lord     Ray
leigh's, seems       justify the application
                               to                  Lord Kelvin’s                   of
formula     to
            these two cases.
   All the work      far described has been with waves easily
                                so
visible, and these very probably have      amplitude too large          an
to allow    the application
             of                 Lord Kelvin’s formula. Lord

        To

  another horizontal and perpendicular to the screw, and the
  third perpendicular to the plane of the other two. To do this
 a mirror was mounted on the carriage perpendicular to the
 length of the screw, and a telescope (placed about ten feet
 from it) was focussed on the image in the mirror of a vertical
 scale fixed to the telescope.                   If
                                      the carriage rotates about a
 horizontal axis perpendicular to the screw, the image of the
 scale will be displaced vertically with respect to the spider
 lines of the telescope.   The carriage was moved several times
 over the entire   length of the ways, but no displacement of the
 scale was noticed except what might be due to changing my
 position with respect to the stand on which the telescope was
 p laced.
     The rotations about the other axes were tested in a similar
 manner and with the same result.             This proved that the
 irregularities of the ways are at most very slight.
     To test the rigidity of the arms and mirror-clamps, the
carriage was screwed along until the spider-line in the tele
scope on the carriage coincided with a well-defined crest.
 It was then slipped back, leaving the nut in place on the
 screw, and again moved up by hand to the nut.              The line
again coincided with the crest.       This  proved   that moving  the
carriage by hand produced no effect on the relative positions
of the carriage and                   its
                          appurtenances.      The carriage was then
again slid from the nut, and while held with one hand             was                    it
struck several sharp, horizontal taps with block           soft wood.
                                                                  a            of
It   was then moved back against the nut.               the telescope    If
and mirrors are clamped tightly the line again coincides with
the crest. This proves that slight jars               the screw will   of
introduce              no
                error into the results     the telescope and mirrors

    Having settled this point, the other adjustments, which
will now       described, were made and then the ways were

380     Dr. N. Ernest Dorsey      on the Surface-Tension            of
 regions I could detect not the slightest shift; so think the  I
readings are entirely free from any error due to inaccuracies
in the ways. Any error in the other adjustments also causes
a shift in the positions of the crosses; but this is uniform
throughout the length of the ways, and so can easily be dis
 tinguished from the non-uniform displacements due to faults
in the ways.
                   Ertraneous Disturbances.
   Having disposed of these difficulties we come to another
that gave great trouble.    This is the disturbance of the liquid
by extraneous vibrations.     After trying many plans I finally
placed the box containing the tray of water and the fork F,
upon an iron slab (H) weighing about 150 pounds, and sup
ported by long steel springs hung from a joist whose ends
rested in the walls of the building but which was free from
the floor above.     It was hung so that when weighted for
work it was about three or four centimetres above the top of
a brick pier, and the intermediate space between it and the
pier was loosely filled with cotton batting.    If the cotton is
packed neither too tightly nor too loosely, this arrangement
cuts out most extraneous disturbances.       The dividing-engine
was   supported  on this pier.   The fork which generated the
ripples, and the vessel of water were each supported on pieces
of rubber tubing, so that the water might not be disturbed
by any slight vibration of the stard of the fork.
                      Influence of Glass Plate.
    Another   point  of prime importance is to have the glass
 plate which generates the waves well wetted by the liquid.
  f it is not, the crests will be so irregular and so distorted
that no correct setting can be made.        A microscope-slide was
first used, but it was very difficult to get        its
                                                   surface     such in

with caustic potash, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, chromic acid;
I  even boiled them      inchromic acid and still water would not
readily wet them, and never under any condition did                         I
succeed   in  wetting them uniformly.           finally used
                                                I               piece   a

    When I  began    this work    Ialways took one reading within
two centimetres         of
                        the  fork,     order that
                                      in             Imight run the

reflected waves. The other reading was taken some five                      or
ten waves further from the fork.

   The results obtained by this method were very erratic.
The wave-lengths found on any one day would agree fairly
well among themselves, but those obtained on different days
seldom agreed at all.          Later on it was found that the appa
rent    wave-length depended upon how many waves were
included between the settings.
    After trying every plan I could devise to find the trouble,
 I at last decided to measure each individual wave and see if
these separate determinations would throw any light on the
difficulty. In this series of measurements I went as close to
the fork as I could measure, and I found (although these
separate determinations were very rough) that the apparent
 wave-length increased as the fork was approached.               As a last
 resort  I attributed this effect to the rise of the       liquid  against
 the  plate   which    generates    the  ripples,  although    I did not
think that this could affect waves two centimetres distant.
To test this experimentally, the plate that was well wetted
 ;
           Distance from fork.                    Distance from fork.
was replaced by one coated with paraffin.              It was now found
that the waves      apparently    decreased as we    approach    the fork.
This proved that, contrary to expectations, the effect of the
meniscus makes itself felt two or three centimetres from the
fork. Two typical curves showing this effect are given in
figs, 2 & 3 ; the abscisse denote distances from the plate, and
the ordinates represent the apparent wave-lengths magnified
ten times.      The numbers denote centimetres.

   The magnitude of the error introduced in this way depends
upon the amplitude of the waves, and this is probably the
reason why the results obtained on different days were not
comparable ; for                   I
                      frequently changed the amplitude of my
fork so as to alter the distinctness of the field in the telescope.
Many weeks were spent in locating this error; and after
finding it no reading was taken nearer the fork than four
centimetres.    Under these conditions the measured wave
length does not depend upon the number of waves measured,
nor upon the distance of the waves from the fork, nor upon
the amplitude of the fork (so long as it is simall).      All these
points were tested experimentally.     was very seldom troubled    I
with reflected waves.
     The mirrors           Mi and            M2 must be good plane metal                    mirrors.

cannot be used, since in my arrangement the images overlap

   This method, however, cannot be depended upon except to
give the whole number of vibrations per second. To deter
mine the exact frequency Michelson's method" was employed;
but the results were carried to but two decimal places, as the
frequency of a fork driven by a mercury contact does not
seem to be more constant than this approximation.      Now, in
order to use this   method,  the clock must  give exactly  equal
intervals of time ; Prof. Michelson says that the intervals
must differ by less than 0.002 second in rating a fork of 128
complete vibrations per second. The clock at my disposal
had a mercury contact, and I found that working alone I
could not adjust this so accurately in the centre of the arc of
the pendulum as is required for consistent results.      In any
case, as Prof. Michelson states, a mercury contact is not very
good unless it is quite narrow in the direction of the swing of
the pendulum.
    After trying many contacts, and working on the subject
for some time, I finally devised one that is very simple and
has so far given perfect satisfaction.       A contact is desired
that can be      easily  adjusted  so as to  give absolutely equal
                     ;
intervals of time so it seemed that the best method would be
to use the complete period of the pendulum instead of the
half period, as is ordinarily adopted. This would obviate the
difficulty of centering the apparatus.
    The construction of the contact is as follows:—A steel
watch-spring about 8 cm. long is soldered to a brass collar
 which is fastened by a screw to one end of a brass plate 4 cm.
wide and 10 cm. long. The collar can be rotated about the
 axis of the screw, and can be clamped tightly at any angle
 desired.     Perpendicular to the flat surface of the spring and
 about 5 cm. from the collar is soldered a platinum point
 which, when the spring is slightly depressed, dips into mer

which projects horizontally from the rod, and whose plane is
inclined to the rod at an angle of about 50° or more.       The
lengths of the needle-point and of this short piece of spring
are such that when they are in place and the pendulum is at
rest they overlap by an amount just sufficient to ensure the
depressing of the needle-point at each complete vibration of
the pendulum.       Both sides of this piece of spring are care
fully polished, and the collar is so adjusted that the needle
point comes just below the upper edge of the spring. The
 electric circuit is completed through the long spring and the
 mercury cup. Then, when the pendulum swings in one direction
 the platinum point is depressed into the mercury closing the
circuit, and it immediately rises and breaks the circuit as the
pendulum swings on ; on the return swing the platinum
point is slightly raised. If the damping vane works properly
the vibrations of the spring will be practically dead-beat, and
we shall have contact made once only during each complete
 vibration of the pendulum.
    Dr. J. F. Mohler kindly compared the clock I used with
 the astronomical one, and found that each single swing of
the pendulum corresponds to 1-000307 seconds; the mean
solar day being the unit of time.   Hence we are justified in
taking the complete period of the pendulum as two seconds.
   As any change in the position of the blades Sº affects the
period of the fork,                   its

How        does the viscosity                of the liquid affect the apparent wave
lengths?     Prof. Tait” has shown that viscosity does not
affect the true wave-length, but simply introduces a damping
factor of the form e-", where 2 depends upon the wave
length and upon the viscosity of the liquid.       Hence the
apparent wave-length is the distance between the consecutive
                                                                         -

metres; and can easily adjust the line to the centre of this
field to within one millimetre ; i.e. one-twentieth of the total
angle through which         I turned the telescope.        If the error
was proportional to the angle this would correspond to an
error of 0.01 per cent.; but the error varies almost as the
cosine of the angle.      Hence the error introduced is negligible.
                          Effect of Particles.
     In  the same article Prof. Tait shows that the effect of a
 “uniform film of oxide or dust, in separate particles which
 adhere to and move with the surface” is to increase the
 wave-length if there is no viscosity.          If  terms involving the
 first power of the viscosity must be taken into account, the
 surface-layer will not affect the wave-length, but will aid
 viscosity in causing the waves to subside as they advance.
                           Water and Salts.
     The water used in these experiments was especially dis
 tilled by Dr. W. T. Mather, and was the kind he used for his
 electrolytic work. He distilled it from chromic acid, and
 from potassium permanganate, and condensed it in a block
 tin condenser. It was collected in a bottle used for no other
 purpose, which was kept always covered or stoppered. It
  was transferred from this to a larger bottle that had a hole
 bored near its bottom so that the water could be drawn off
 through a piece of black rubber tubing and a glass nozzle.
  This tubing and nozzle always remained filled with water
  which protected their inner surface from impurities in the air.
  The glass nozzle was removed and cleaned before drawing
  the water.     In this way it was hoped to get water as pure as
  possible.    I might mention here that the water and solutions
  were not free from air; but Röntgen and Schneider" have
  shown that the effect of dissolved air is entirely negligible at
  ordinary pressures.
      I used Eimer and Amend's chemically pure salts.
      The temperatures of the water and of the solutions were
  determined by means of a Bender and Hobein thermometer
  of “Normalglas’ graduated to tenths of a degree Centigrade.
      The densities of the solutions of sodium chloride, of sodium
  carbonate, and of zinc sulphate were calculated from the
  values given by Kohlrausch and Hallwachs                f;   those for
  potassium chloride from the results obtained by Bender f ;

                        Method         of Observation.
   Before each series of readings the tray, the glass plate, the
brass hoop for cleaning the surface of the liquid, the ther
mometer, and the stirring rod were washed, first with tap
water, then with an alcoholic solution of caustic potash, then
with running tap-water, then with chromic acid, and, finally,
they were well rinsed in running tap-water. Then everything
was placed in position in the iron box, water was run into
the tray until the lower edge of the glass plate dipped just
under the surface.       I
                       then expanded the hoop, put the lid on
the box, and brought the iron slab to rest as soon as possible.
Then the forks were set in vibration, the spider-line of the
telescope was brought into coincidence with a crest near the
middle of the pan, and the amplitude of the vibrations was
increased until the crest was almost out of focus.    As stated
before, the waves appear stationary.    Then the shunt circuit

water; then more salt is added, and so on until readings have
been taken on water and on solutions of (as a rule) four
different concentrations.   Then the volume of the solution is
measured.               I
               measure the volume last so that the purity of
the water may not be affected by any trace of grease that
might be on the measuring vessel.
   Since each crest is seen in two positions, measuring over
forty crests gives the length of twenty waves. Such a series
of readings as I have just described occupies about two hours;
and to make sure that the surface in this length of time
does not become contaminated so as to affect my results, a
check series was taken on water. The first readings gave
Tis-9-73°10, or Tiss=7324; the last, about two and one-half
hours later, gave Tige.8–72-91, or Tiss=73-18.       Hence the
results obtained from such a series of readings that extend
over about two hours should be not appreciably affected by
the contamination of the surface by the air.
   By this plan of work we obtain for each concentration two
sets of three independent determinations of the wave-length.
If the averages of these two sets agree fairly well, the surface
tension is calculated from their mean.        they do not agree    If
well another series is taken, and the surface-tension is calcu
lated from the weighted mean of the three series.

   In   the first series for potassium chloride the two forks
were not in unison when the surface-tension of the water was
determined, but were afterwards adjusted.                        This accounts for
the low value found for water. In the case of the carbonates,

LII.      The Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics in slowly and
   rapidly changing Electric Fields.                  By ERVIN S. FERRY”.
        WER since Maxwell pointed out that the electromagnetic
       theory of light requires a certain definite relation to
hold between the index of refraction and the dielectric constant
of a medium transmitting light, persistent attempts have been
made to determine the dielectric constants of various optical
substances, in the hope that such determinations would afford
an explanation of anomalous reflexion and refraction, and
the peculiarities observed when light is transmitted through
crystalline media that are heated or are under mechanical,
electrostatic, or magnetic stress.     The results obtained by
different experimenters vary through a wide range, due largely
to the great difficulties in the determination of the dielectric
constant, and also in many cases to lack of knowledge of the
periodicity of the electrical disturbance employed in making
the measurements.         While with our present limitations
regarding the production of measurable electromagnetic
oscillations of a period approaching that of visible radiance,
it may be impossible to obtain quantitative data bearing upon
anomalous reflexion and dispersion, still the piezo-optical,
electro-optical, magneto-optical, and pyro-optical problems
appear of perfectly definite solution.    It was with regard to
the study of this class of phenomena that the present series of
experiments was begun.
     he object of the present investigation is the perfection of
a null method of determining the specific inductive capacity
of crystals and other optical substances that does not require
large masses of the substance; that does not require the
dimensions of the substance to be known or the specimen to
be of any particular shape; that is independent of the nature
of the surface; that is sensitive to small variations of the
quantity measured ; in which the labour of computation of
results is reduced to a minimum ; and in which the periodicity
of the oscillations used can be easily experimentally obtained.
   Three different properties of dielectrics have been utilized
to determine the specific inductive capacity of substances.
Cavendish discovered that the capacity of a condenser depends
upon the medium between the plates. The ratio of the
        }.
capacity of a condenser having any given dielectric between
byits
   plates     to   its
                  capacity with air   the dielectric, was called
                                              as
              the Specific Inductive Capacity      the given subof
                         *   Communicated    by   the Author.

          The Specific Inductive Capacity      of Dielectrics.      405
stance, and by Maxwell the Dielectric Constant.                 If  two
similar condensers are electrified from the same source            they
will attain the same potential, and the charges they receive
will be proportional to their capacities. By determining the
ratio of these charges the ratio of the capacities is determined ;
and if air be one of the dielectrics, this ratio is the specific
inductive capacity of the other dielectric.          This is the basis
of the majority of the methods for determining dielectric
constants.    Again, the force of attraction exerted between
two plates charged to different potentials is proportional to
the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric separating
them ; so that, by weighing the force of attraction between
two charged plates the specific inductive capacity of the inter
vening dielectric can be determined.           And finally, methods
have been employed based upon the fact that the period of
the electrical waves sent out when an electrical system is
discharged is proportional to the square root of the capacity
and self-induction of the electrical system.
   The method used probably more than any other is a modi
fication of Thomson's induction balance first employed by
Gordon". It consists of five parallel disks, three forming a
primary system and two a secondary. The primary system
consists of the two outside plates connected together, and the
                .
middle plate. When a difference of potential is established
between the outside plates and the middle plate, the other
two smaller intermediate plates can be so placed in the
resulting field of force that there will be no potential-difference
induced upon them. The introduction of a dielectric between
any two of the plates will disturb the equilibrium, and in
order to again bring the small plates to equal potential, one or
both must be            with regard to the primary system of
large plates. The amount of the change of position of the
small plates required to again secure equilibrium after the
introduction of the dielectric gives the means of computing
the change of capacity of the system produced by the intro
duction of the dielectric, and hence the specific inductive
capacity of the dielectric.      A successful modification of this
method has been used by Blondlott, who, instead of securing
equilibrium by moving the secondary plate, introduced
between one of the primary and one of the secondary plates
such a thickness of another dielectric of known specific             in
ductive capacity that the spark ceased in a micrometer air
gap placed between the secondary plates.                 In Blondlot's
experiment he used two thin wedges of sulphur arranged like

a Babinet Compensator, so that the thickness of sulphur intro
duced could be varied at pleasure.
    By comparing the force of attraction exerted on a small
sphere of a dielectric when placed in a field of known intensity
with the force exerted on a metallic sphere of equal size placed
 in the same field, Boltzmann” has measured the dielectric
constants of several amorphous solids, and also the dielectric
constants of sulphur in the direction of the optical axis.
    The law of the proportionality between the force of attrac
 tion exerted between two plates charged to different potentials
 to the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric separating
 them, has recently been utilized by several experimenters to
 determine dielectric constants of electrolytes. Rosat measured
 the force exerted between a fixed and a movable electrode
 immersed in the liquid dielectric under investigation with a
 form of apparatus similar to that used by Boltzmann. One elec
 trode was stationary and one was suspended on the end of a light
horizontal rod by means of a thin fibre, in a manner analogous
 to the Cavendish balance. Lefevre f substituted a beam
 balance for the torsion balance. One pan was replaced by
an electrode, and the other electrode was fixed a short distance
 beneath. Trouton and Lilly $ have suggested a method con
 sisting in measuring the force exerted by a charged condenser
tending to draw a dielectric in between the plates.              The
apparatus consists of the alternate quadrants of a quadrant
electrometer charged to different potentials, the other two
quadrants being removed.          The specimen whose dielectric
constant is to be determined is made in the form of an elec
trometer-needle and is suspended between the quadrants.
     J. J.Thomson | and A. Perot" have found the constants
of various dielectrics by measuring the wave-length of the
electrical vibrations given out by a discharging condenser
when the plates are separated by                        air
                                          and when they are sepa

capacity of a dielectric is determined.       Thwing * has de
veloped the method into one requiring only the measurement
of the capacity of an air-condenser.   In this method a Hertzian
resonating circuit is placed parallel to, and at a short distance
from, a similar exciting circuit connected to an induction-coil.
By changing the capacities the two circuits can be put into
resonance with each other, resonance being determined by
noting the maximum deflexion of a dynamometer in the
secondary circuit.  In determining the dielectric constant of
an electrolyte, a sample is placed between the plates of the
condenser in the secondary circuit and the capacity of the
primary circuit changed till resonance is attained.          Then
replacing the condenser containing the electrolyte by an air
                                                         }.
condenser, resonance is again secured by changing the distance
separating the plates of the latter.           gives the capacity
of the condenser  containing  the electrolyte.    By knowing the
capacity of the same condenser when empty the specific
inductive capacity of the electrolyte is determined.          This
method is  probably  the most  rapidly  and most   easily operated
of any of equal accuracy yet described.
   The method now to be described consists in getting two
electrical systems of equal self-induction in resonance with a
third system in which rapid electrical oscillations are set up by
means of an induction-coil and spark-gap.        The periods of the
electrical oscillations in the two secondary  circuits will therefore
be equal to each other, and hence the capacities in these
two circuits will be equal. The capacities in one of the two
secondary circuits is produced by an adjustable air-condenser,
and the capacity in the other circuit consists of a condenser
with plates separated by a fixed distance.             By securing
resonance of the two        secondary  circuits with the primary,
first when the empty condenser with fixed plates is in one of
the secondary circuits, and then again when a dielectric is
inserted between     itsplates, the specific inductive capacity               of
the dielectric  is determined          by
                                    simply computing the capacity
of the  adjustable  air-condenser        the two cases.

   The first adjustment of the apparatus required is to secure
resonance of the two secondary circuits with the primary.
With circuits of fixed self-induction placed in inductive
relation with each other, resonance can be produced by simply
altering the capacity in one of the circuits.  The adjustment
is known to be that giving the most perfect resonance when
the current oscillating back and forth in the secondary is a
maximum.      In this experiment the current flowing in the
secondary circuits is determined by measuring the change in
resistance of a portion of the circuit produced by the heating
effect of the current.      If the two secondaries are singly in
resonance with the primary, they are in resonance with each
other.    The condenser that is to contain the specimen is con
nected to one primary circuit, the condenser removed from
the other secondary, and then the capacity in the primary
circuit adjusted till the galvanometer-needle gives a maximum
deflexion.     Now this secondary is in resonance with the
primary. Then the condenser is removed from this secondary
circuit and inserted in the other secondary.                 If the two
secondaries have the same self-induction, this latter arrange
ment will also give a maximum galvanometer deflexion and
in the opposite direction to that in the former arrangement,
but the deflexions in the two cases may not be exactly equal.
These maximum deflexions can be made equal by slightly
adjusting the distance between the rectangular circuits.               In
these   experiments   the three   rectangular    circuits were     placed
about 10 cm. apart. The two condensers now in circuit are
allowed to remain unaltered, the standard air-condenser is
inserted in the remaining secondary circuit and                its
                                                                 capacity
altered until the galvanometer deflexion            is zero. The con
densers      in
              the  secondary    circuits  may   now      beinterchanged
without   altering   the  galvanometer      deflexion.     The capacity

                Inductive Capacity             of Dielectrics.                 411
plates  of the standard condenser substituted in Kirchhoff's
formula gives, with a minimum amount of computation, the
capacity of the condenser containing the specimen.               By
determining the capacity when the specimen condenser is
empty and when it is filled with a dielectric, the specific
              j,
inductive capacity of the dielectric is determined.
    In this way the specific inductive capacity was determined
of several       as follows:—Petroleum 1-99; cotton-seed oil
3:00; olive oil 3:02; castor oil 4:49.
    The period of the electrical oscillations used in charging the
dielectrics was determined by a method due to J. J. Thomson*.
Two bare copper wires of about 20 metres length were stretched
parallel to each other about the room with one end of each
wire attached to one of two small copper disks placed close
to the plates of the standard air-condenser.       The remaining
two ends of the long copper wires were left free. A sensitive
telephone was connected by wires of equal length to the long
conductors.    When one telephone terminal is attached to one
 end of one of the long conductors and the other terminal
 made to slide along the other conductor, the sound in the
 telephone will pass through a series of intensities from mini
 mum to maximum.         The linear distance between any two
 points of the conductor giving a minimum sound is one half
 of the wave-length of the electrical vibrations charging the
 condenser containing the dielectric.        The wave-length was
 found to be about 9:10  metres, which   corresponds  to a vibration
 frequency of 33,000,000 per second. Since it is only the
 order of magnitude of the vibration frequency that is required,
and as the accuracy of this determination is necessarily un
certain, this value was taken to apply to the case of              the    all
dielectrics examined.      This the more
                                      is      justifiable   the rangeas
of  these specific inductive capacities extends only from 1.99
to 4'60.
   This method      isalso applicable       the determination
                                                to                 the    of

412               Mr. Ervin S. Ferry             on the Specific
no deflexion of the galvanometer-needle was produced when
a sheet of ebonite was introduced between the plates of the
condenser or when the ebonite was removed. The specific
inductive capacity of ebonite is consequently taken to be 2:32.
   A number of sections of quartz of different thicknesses,
from 1 millimetre to 3 miliimetres, were cut from several clear
crystals.    Sections were made both in the direction of the
optic axis and normal to the axis.        Some sections had approxi
mately parallel faces and some were visibly wedge-shaped;
some were polished, some simply smoothed, and some left just
as they came from the saw. The mean value of the specific
inductive capacity of the sections cut normal to the optic axis
was found to be 4:34, and of those cut parallel to the axis
4:27.    The greatest difference between either of these mean
 values and of any value actually observed would change simply
 the figure in the second decimal place.
   In order to determine the change of specific inductive
capacity with change of period of the electrical vibration to
which the dielectric is subjected, the spark-gap in the primary
circuit was opened so wide that no sparks crossed, and hence
the electrical oscillation would be produced simply on the
make and break of the interrupter of the induction-coil.            But
with this   arrangement    there was not sufficient    energy  induced
on the secondary circuits to produce readable galvanometer
deflexions even when the condenser was removed from one
of the secondary circuits.
   In consequence, an entirely different method was employed
to determine the specific inductive capacity with slowly
vibrating fields. The method is a very simple one, and no
serious trouble was found in               its
                                          operation.         simply

of refraction, in accordance with the electromagnetic theory.
The value of the dielectric constant in the two directions,
however, is nearly twice as large as the square of the corre
sponding index of refraction.
   The values in the preceding table show that in the case of
every substance examined, there is a difference of the dielectric
constant for rapidly changing and slowly changing fields.
It is to be expected that the amount of this difference should
be proportional     to the electricalabsorption of the substance.
If  electrical absorption is due to a heterogeneous structure of
the medium, as developed in the theories of Clausius and
Maxwell, the minimum amount of electrical absorption would
be exhibited by crystals; and consequently, the difference in
the value of the dielectric constant of a crystal for rapidly
changing and slowly changing fields would be less than that
of an amorphous substance. Rowland and Nichols “ have
measured the electrical absorption of several substances, and
find crystals to exhibit very much less absorption than amor
phous substances.     Thus is explained the fact that the dielectric
constant of quartz suffers less change than the other substances
                                                                     .
examined when subjected to fields of various periodicities.
For the same change of periodicity of charge, ebonite shows
the greatest difference in specific inductive capacity of any
of the substances examined. The insulating               give differ
ences   nearly  equal to each other.
   It is interesting to note in this connexion the behaviour of
some plates of quartz that in polarized light showed in one part
of the section beautiful Airy's spirals. With these specimens
it was difficult to obtain the specific inductive capacity, because
the change in position of the specimen with respect to the plates
of the   oil  condenser gave slightly different values             the          of
constant being determined.        But this much         certain, thatis
the difference      inthe specific inductive capacity         rapidly      in
changing and slowly changing fields           greater    the  part    in             of

Palº        to the invention of the McLeod vacuum gauge,
       the measurement of even moderately small gaseous
  ressures was difficult, and subject to large errors.       The
introduction of the McLeod gauge, however, early in the
seventies, seemed to solve the problem.     In    ordinary form,                 its
and for most    purposes,  this beautiful instrument admirably
serves the purpose for which          designed.   But when very
                                                     it   is
                            pressures of           few millionths   as
                                                                              its as
accurate measurements                    small

          atmospheric pressure are desired,       performance                     a                    is
extremely unsatisfactory and vexatious.        As    well known,                       is
the chief cause     the  difficulty
                            of         the unequal  and variable

whose difference        height indirectly serves
                            in                             the measure           as                    of
pressure.    Accurate measurement             this  capricious ofdifference
obviously avails nothing.

               or                    was engagedI            investigation   in    an
requiring frequent and simultaneous measurements                      slight,                    of
but different pressures,          two large glass globes connected
                                           in
 by   a             tube.     For this purpose          constructed and     I
carefully callibrated two large McLeod gauges. The internal
diameter         the mercury tubes was about
                of                                             millimetres,            3

                                          bore. These gauges were
often compared              by
                        measuring the same vacuum with both                                            ;
but they rarely gave concordant results. Indeed                     was not                 it

 416                      Mr. C. F. Brush                       on the Measurement
 McLeod gauge which it is the purpose of this paper to discuss.
 It was deemed necessary to provide an apparatus capable of
 easy   use, and giving results having a probable error not
greater than a fiftieth part of a millionth of atmospheric
pressure. My hopes of aitaining this high ideal were far
more than realized, as the sequel will show. Instead of having
to wait days or weeks, in the course of my investigations, for
the evolution of a measurable quantity of gas as had been
expected, the progress of evolution could be noted from hour
to hour; and the increase in the rate of evolution due to a
rise of one degree in the temperature of the laboratory was
unmistakable.
   The diagram herewith shows the essential parts of my
apparatus. The bulb A, of the gauge, is made conical in                                                             its

result  is better.
   In  this example we have the measurement                  about two             of
millionths       atmospheric
                  of            pressure,   with    probable    error    a                              of

     rom the foregoing we may safely conclude that with the
apparatus described, small gaseous pressures may                  easily                    be
measured with        probable  error   less than      thousandth part

424        Mr. E. Rutherford     on the Velocity and Rate
the rate of production of the ions by the rays is equal to their
rate of recombination.      If
                             q be the number of conducting
particles per c.c. produced per second by the rays, and N the

where 2 is a constant for any particular gas but varies             for
different gases.   When the rays are stopped the rate                of
diminution of the number of conducting particles is given           by
                           dn

   The time T for the number of conducting          particles   to fall
to half their total number is given by
                                § =aT.
                                                     ".
   Now the rates of leak at the electrodes in the tube are pro
portional to n, since an electromotive force is          to the
gas sufficient to completely saturate the gas. From the ex
perimental data of the rates of leak at different intervals we
may compare the experimental results with those obtained

This can be best shown by plotting curves whose ordinates
            conductivities and abscissae time intervals.
     ig. 1 shows such curves where the continuous curve re
presents the relation between the conductivity and time as
determined by experiment, and the dotted curve the theoretical
relation         is deduced. In order to compare the curves,
one  point  on the experimental curve is chosen also as a point
on the theoretical curve.     In fig. 1, the common point is P,
where the conductivity has fallen to half     its
                                               value.
 It   will  beobserved that the two curves are      close agree
                                                    in
ment, and the differences between them are well within the
limitsof   experimental error. This shows that the formula

intervals after the cessation of the radiation a large E.M.F.
was applied to the outside coating of the bell-jar and the
quantity of electricity which was given up to the central
electrode was determined.
   A pendulum interrupter was used to break the battery
circuit, and to apply the E.M.F. at varying intervals.          A
heavy iron ball was suspended by a wire 315 cm. long, and
              were broken by a rod fixed to the bottom of the

                                                     A battery of
one hundred small accumulators had one         pole  connected to
earth and the other pole through a high carbon resistance R
to the copper support E. A wire passed from E to the tin
foil on the outside of the conducting vessel H. The lever
DF, which was kept pressed against E by a spring, was
connected to a good earth. When the lever was in position,
therefore, the vessel H was very nearly at zero potential, for
the resistance of the lever DF and the earth connexions was
                                    º
very small compared with the carbon resistance R. When
the pendulum struck the lever DF the earth connexion was
broken and the vessel H was immediately charged up to the
potential of the battery.    By altering the distance between
the two levers the time between               the battery current
and applying the E.M.F. could be varied within limits.

  Immediately after the passage of the pendulum the lever
DF was replaced, thus reducing H to zero potential again.

when the E.M.F. was applied to and removed from H, the
electrometer was not directly connected to L until the lever
           |.
had been replaced. The capacity M was introduced in order
to prevent       potential of the circuit LM rising to any con
siderable extent when the E.M.F. was applied to H.
Fº It was found that applying and removing the E.M.F. alone
           no effect on the electrometer; but when the rays
 ad acted on the gas inside the vessel L, there was always a
deflexion in the electrometer, showing that the electrode L
had received a charge of the same sign as the pole of the
battery.
   Since the E.M.F. applied was usually over 200 volts, a
value sufficient to completely saturate the gas, the quantity
of electricity that passed through the gas was proportional to
        ...
n, the number of ions present in the gas at the instant the
E.M.F. was applied, while an immediate application of the
E.M.F.             rays had ceased gave the total number N.
   The rate of recombination of the ions could thus be com
pletely determined, as the times taken by the pendulum to
pass from one lever to the other could be very -

  The value of the deflexion is practically constant for nearly
   second after the rays have ceased.       After an interval of
4 seconds the air still possesses appreciable  conductivity.
  Since the  gases have   widely  different conductivities under
the X rays, it is to be expected that the rate of recombination
is different for the various gases.
   The following table gives the times T for the number of
ions to fall to half their original number. The intensity of
the radiation was sensibly constant for   all

   There seems to be no close connexion between the values
of T and the conductivities, although as a general rule it may
be taken that the value of T diminishes with increase of con
ductivity.
   It was found, however, that the rate of recombination was
not always the same for the same gas with the same intensity
of radiation, but depended largely on the amount of dust
suspended in the gas as will be shown later in the paper.
        Effect of Intensity of Radiation on the value of T.
   The value of T for the same gas was found to depend
largely on the intensity of the radiation.                    This is to be ex
pected from theoretical considerations, for

   If then      a is a constant for the same gas in the same state,
T varies inversely as Vy. This relation was found to hold
experimentally, for q is proportional to the intensity of the
radiation, which varies inversely as the square of the distance
from the bulb.
   For example, for a definite intensity of radiation the value
of T was 25 second.                     On placing a thick aluminium sheet

meter of 70 divisions, and the value of T was 1 second.                                                           A
blast of dusty air from a bellows was then sent into the
cylinder and the deflexion due to the after-effect fell imme
diately to 15 divisions, with a value of       of about 15 sec.                    T
When the air was allowed to stand the after-effect gradually
increased again to 35 divisions, with a value of T of 5 sec.
after an interval of about 10 minutes.     Several hours elapsed
before the after-effect rose to 60 divisions.   This experiment
shows what a variable quantity T is for the same gas, de
pending as it does on the amount of suspended matter in the
 aS.
   The effects observed in air and other gases seem to point
to the conclusion that freely suspended particles greatly assist
a gas to lose                   its
                    conducting property after the rays have
ceased.

                                    Velocity of the Ions.
   It is a question of considerable interest to determine the
velocity with which the ions travel through a gas under the
influence of an electromotive force, as it indirectly gives us
some information in regard to the nature and size of the
carrier of electricity in conduction under the Röntgen rays
   The method of determining the velocities was based on an
investigation given in a previous paper (J.        Thomson and               J.
E.   Rutherford,  Phil. Mag. Nov.  1896), where it is shown that

depending as it does on whether the gas is freshly made or
has stood undisturbed for some time.
    For a determination of the velocity of the ions the value of
T   requires  to be known with accuracy; but it is a difficult
matter to determine T accurately with a pendulum inter
rupter, and moreover the intensity of the radiation from the
Crookes’ tube, on which the value of T largely depends, is
very liable to change over a long range of experiments.
Recourse was therefore had to a simpler method of deter
mining T, which was found to give very consistent and
reliable results.    It has been shown that the final number of
ions N is given by
                               q=aN',
and also
                               k =aT,

    Now if a very large E.M.F. is applied to the testing-vessel
the instant after the rays have ceased, the deflexion of the
electrometer is proportional to N, and q is proportional to the
 rate of leak per second for a saturating E.M.F.      The ratio of
these two quantities is thus readily determined and the value
of T known.
                   Arrangement   of the Experiment.
     The testing-vessel consisted of two parallel plates, the lower
 being of aluminium and the upper of sheet lead. These
 plates were separated by blocks of paraffin, which were
 melted together and formed the sides of the testing-vessel,
 and at the same time insulated the top from the bottom plate.
 In order to measure the after-conductivity with accuracy fairly
 large plates were required.     In the apparatus used the plates
 were 22 cm.      square   and 4.7 cm. apart.    The rays passed
 through the lower aluminium plate and made the gas inside
 the vessel a conductor, but were completely stopped by the
 top lead plate.    Care was taken that the radiation fell only
 on the central     portion  of the plate where the electrostatic
 field was sensibly uniform.
     The arrangement of the apparatus was the same as that
 given in fig. 2, with the exception that the bell-jar was re
 Fº       by the vessel with parallel plates. One pole of a
   attery of small accumulators was connected to the lower
 plate, and the electrometer to the upper.

    It will be seen from the above table that the velocities    of
 the ions follow    the inverse order of the densities with the
 exception of chlorine gas. The velocity of the hydrogen ion
 through hydrogen is nearly four times as fast as the velocity of
 the oxygen ion in oxygen.      The ions of sulphur dioxide gave
 the slowest velocity, being only about <U+017F>o of that of hydrogen.
    The velocity of the ions through a gas was found to be
 independent of the amount of ionization of the gas. The
 velocities deduced from the two different sets of experiments,
 when the intensity of radiation in one case was six times that
 of the other, were found to be the same. In the one case,
 therefore, six times as many ions per c.c. were present as in
 the other, but the velocity remained unaltered.        There is
 thus no correction to be applied for the velocity of the ions
 in a gas like chlorine, whose ionization is large compared
 with that of air. The fact that the velocity under a given
 small electromotive force is independent of the number of
 ions per c.c. in the gas, shows that the movement of the
 positive and negative ions does not produce any resultant
 electrostatic field between the plates.
    In the method which has been used for determining the
 velocity, it has been assumed that the conductivity of the
 gas is purely due to volume ionization of the gas. Perrin
 (Comptes Rendus, March 1st, 1897) has, however, recently
 shown that the rate of leak between two plates is made up
 of two parts, one due to the volume ionization of the gas,
 and the other due to surface ionization at the surface of
 separation of the metal plate, on which the radiation im
 pinges, and the surrounding gas. The rate of leak due to the
 surface action is quite comparable with that due to the
 volume ionization, when the plates are 1 cm. apart, especially
in the case when the electrodes are of silver, gold, or zinc.
    It seems probable that the gas close to the surface of the
 plate on which the radiation falls has a much greater densit
of ionization than the gas between the plates, and since this
increase is confined to a very thin layer close to the elec
trode, that the rate of recombination for the surface-ions is
far more rapid than for the Röntgenized air some distance
from the surface. The existence of this effect would tend
                            lº<U+017F>iº
to increase the rate of leak q ; while the number of ions, N,
as determined by the                     of an E.M.F. a short
interval after the rays had ceased, would not be appreciably
affected, since the ions near the surface probably recombine
with great rapidity. The value of T which is obtained from
the equation
               T-      would thus be too small.  The correction

436         Mr. E. Rutherford          on the Velocity and Rate
for the surface ionization is probably, however, very small,
for the lower plate of the testing-vessel was of aluminium—a
metal which does not appreciably exhibit the phenomena of
surface ionization—and the upper of lead, in which the effect
is slight.   In addition to this the plates were nearly 5 cms.
apart, so that the volume effect was very large compared with
that due to the surface.
   The velocities which have been determined are the sum of
the velocities of the positive and negative ions, but we have
so far given no direct experimental evidence to show whether
 the velocities of the positive and negative ions are the same.
   In the case of air, an experiment which will now be de
scribed seems to show that the velocities of the two ions are
equal or very approximately so.
   In previous determinations the calculation of the velocity
of the ions has depended on the truth of an equation whic
has been experimentally verified as far as possible, but in
the case of air the velocity may be obtained by a method
not involving any theory depending on the rate of recom
bination of the ions.

pole being connected to earth.        The plate B was connected
through a contact-lever, LM, mounted on an insulating
block, to one pair of quadrants of the electrometer, the other
being connected to earth. The pendulum interrupter was so
arranged as to make the current in the primary of the induction
coil, to break the electrometer-circuit by knocking away the
lever LM, and then to break the battery-circuit shortly after
wards.       For this two other shunt-levers were required which
are not shown in the figure. A condenser, N, was introduced
into the electrometer-circuit       to increase its capacity.     A
steady difference of potential of 220 volts was applied between
the two plates.
     When    the bulb was excited the   ions on one side have to
 travel over a distance of 8 cm. before they reach the plate B.
 The object of the experiment was to determine the interval
 between the starting of the rays and the arrival of the ions
 at the plate B. It was found that there was only a small
 deflexion of the electrometer until after a definite interval
 had elapsed, when the deflexion increased rapidly. This was
 taken as the instant when the ions had reached the electrode.
  The deflexion of the electrometer was proportional to the
  quantity of electricity that had passed from A to B during
  the time between making the current and breaking the elec
  trometer-circuit. The electrometer itself was not connected
  with its circuit until after the contacts had been broken.
      It was found that after the rays had been acting for 36 of
  a second the electrometer deflexion commenced to increase
  rapidly.     A potential-difference of 220 volts was acting
  between the plates, so that the electromotive intensity was
  1375 volts per cm. In the time 36 of a second, therefore,

  under a potential gradient of 13.75, the ions have travelled
   over a distance of 8 cm. This gives a velocity of the ion
   of 1.6 cm. a second, and corresponds to the velocity of a
   positive or a negative ion, for the time taken was found to
   be independent of the sign of the ion.          The sum of the
   velocities of the positive and negative ions is therefore 3.2 cm.
   per second—a result agreeing with that determined for air
   by a               independent method. The close agreement
   between these two results affords strong evidence of the truth
   of the theory by the aid of which the velocities of the ions
   of different gases have been obtained.
      The velocities with which the ions move through the gas
   are immensely greater than the velocity of the ions in the
   electrolysis of liquids. The velocity of the hydrogen ion in
   nearly pure water is 1-08 cm. per hour under a potential
   gradient of 1 volt per cm.; so that the velocity of th      rogen .

 THE1. following    communications
           “Notes on a Collection
                                      were read:—
                                      of Rocks and Fossils from Franz
 Josef Land,   made by the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition during
  1894–96. By E.T. Newton, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., and J. J. H. Teall,
 Esq., M.A., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
    A large collection of rocks and fossils, obtained by the members
 of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition, chiefly from the neigh
 bourhood of Cape Flora, on the south-west of Northbrook Island,
 but also from more distant localities visited during boat- and
 sledge-journeys, have been sent to the Director-General         of the
 Geological Survey, and examined by the authors.
    After a summary of what was previously known of the geology
 of Franz Josef Land, an account of the new specimens is given.
 The rocks are for the most part basalts, and are described in
 detail; they are usually formed of labradorite, augite, and inter
 stitial matter which is sometimes represented by palagonite con
 taining a large percentage of iron-oxide. This palagonite is regarded
 as the hydrated representative of the residual magma left after
 the separation of labradorite and augite; and the conclusion is
 reached that in this case progressive crystallization has resulted
 in the concentration of iron-oxide in the mother liquor.
    Most of the fossils have been collected around Cape Flora. The
presence of Ammonites macrocephalus, A. modiolaris, and Belemnites
 Panderi indicate the presence of rocks of Lower Oxfordian or
Callovian age ; while, apparently above these, a plant-bed was met
with in which the genus Ginkgo is conspicuous, and this is believed
to be of Upper Jurassic age.
    The oldest fossiliferous bed yet found occurs about 20 miles
to the west of Cape Flora, and also contains plant-remains, which,
it is thought, may be Lower Jurassic and possibly of the age of the
Great Oolite.
    These plant-beds and numerous indications of layers of lignite
seem to show that these Jurassic strata are to a great extent of
estuarine or freshwater origin.
    The general structure of the country appears to be typified
by what occurs at Cape Flora, where cliffs of sedimentary strata
some 600 feet high (for the most part hidden by talus) are overlain
by 500 feet of basalt.    At some other localities, however, the basalt
is found at the sea-level.

     It is pointed
                 out that the islands, which make up the archipelago
of Franz Josef   Land, are fragments of a formerly extensive region of
plateau-basalts, similar to that of which the Faerûe and the Western
Isles of Scotland must have formed a part.

I. The Cleeve Hill Plateau.’ By S. S. Buckman, Esq., F.G.S.
   This paper deals with a portion of the Northern Cotteswolds
termed the Cleeve Hill plateau; and, like a previous communication
on the Mid Cotteswolds, it is concerned with the deposits which
intervene between the Upper Freestone and the Upper Trigonia
grit. The author shows that in the Cleeve Hill plateau there                                               is,

penetrate a complete metallic enclosure and affect a coherer inside.
As shown by me in 1894*, they can readily get in by insulated
wires, or by chinks or other interruption of metallic conductivity,

450              Mr.     J.   D. Hamilton Dickson on
  latinum-temperatures, instead of converting them at once
into normal air-temperatures, an equally simple 8-formula
like (4) exists, (19). There only remains one point; does the
proposed formula represent the results of experiment as well
as the others?       To answer this question,      have carefully I
calculated   formulae,    by  the method of least squares, from
the best experimental results obtainable. I give the details of
such calculations for Prof. Callendar’s observations, for those
of Professors Dewar and Fleming, of Mr. E. H. Griffiths,
and of Messrs. Holborn and Wien at low temperatures.                                        I
have also calculated formulae for Messrs. Holborn and Wien’s
high-temperature results", but it is unfortunately impossible
 to base much upon them after the break-down of the appa
ratus.    Prof. Witkowskif gives a rough set of results below
0°C., but without details. I have calculated a formula with
equal care for them, but it leads so far astray that       presume             I
he   only meant his results to be taken as   showing  the

    Professor Callendar’s Observations.—Professor Callendar is
at first less concerned with finding an absolute connexion
 between platinum degrees and the readings of an air-thermo
 meter, than with determining the prior question whether
 there is a strict connexion between the two. The painstaking
 and repeated efforts made to overcome, as he has done success
 fully, the difficulties that arose during the investigation fully
 entitle him to claim the demonstration of his proposition,
 and at the same time make his observations of great value.
 For my present purpose                 I
                                   deal only with those observa
 tions contained in tables A.—v. on pp. 213–216 of (Call.),
 which he considers the most free from error.        have selected    I
the observations chosen, for the following reasons:–Prof.
Callendar found that his air-thermometer readings at constant
volume gave higher values of t—w than those at constant
pressure, the difference in one case being as much as 1° C. at
540° C. (p. 221): the gauge used was specially designed for
readings at constant pressure               (p.
                                    209): readings     constant                at
pressure have less chance     error through dispensing
                                    of of
                                                       with the

employed   isdefined         “the temperature

This is the equation        of
                          curve somewhat like
                               a                  parabola, but,          a
with the  given  constants,    little flatter  one part than
                                       a                          at in                           a
parabola would be, without the curvature      any point ceasing
to be continuous.
   Mr. Griffiths was led    this curve
                                 to        the consideration by                                   of
eight observations, namely, the temperatures       melting ice,             of
and   of the boiling-points (at 760 millim. pressure)     water,                        of
aniline, naphthalene, methyl salicylate, benzophenone, mer
cury, and sulphur. An attempt was made         “draw smooth        to                   a
curve” through these points when plotted but was found             ;              it
that while such    curve could

platinum-thermometers.      There does not seem sufficient cause
to choose only the five points, especially when by the method
of least squares each of the eight observations could have
been made to contribute                             its
                               quota towards getting that rela

urged that this work should in each case accompany the
record of results, when expressed in platinum-temperatures;

enhance the value of the work in such a manner as to amply
recompense the extra labour.         With the view of helping

greater than in delicate freezing-point determinations them

reason why I was unable to obtain in this way even rough

tigating cube-shaped pieces of ice in warmer water or solutions
could I succeed in this. This also furnishes a method for
accurate determination of the relative velocities with which
 ice melts in water and aqueous solutions of different concen

belong to the less accurate ones.    Not only is the value of
to—t, thus made at the freezing-temperature        exceedingly
small, and consequently the experimental error exceedingly
great, but the remaining quantity of ice cannot be strictly
regulated, and this means to—tor, and with it the experimental
error, can easily be in one experiment a multiple of the other.
Moreover, already with a quantity of ice even =0°1 or 0°:2
overcooling, no good equilibrium between ice and the liquid
can be practically established, i. e. no constant apparent
freezing-point can be obtained.     For the correction for the
separated ice see P. B. Lewis, Trans. Chem Soc. 1894.

and no further reaction takes place.             At the real freezing
temperature the equilibrium is therefore a STATIC one ; but as
the reaction of ice-melting or ice-separation never takes place
alone, we never reach the real freezing-temperature, and the
dynamic, not the static, in reality takes place in nature. (See
Rep. Brit. Assoc., Liverpool, 1896.)
      rom this conception of equilibrium at the apparent
freezing - temperature, it follows for the freezing-point
method :-Since at the freezing-temperature                 the liquid
continues to be warmed          by  the  arrangements    of the expe
riment    and,    correspondingly,   the ice continues to melt, the
                                                             .#
warming of the liquid must be kept as small as possible ;
i. e. C and t,    -t  must be, also for this reason, correspondingly
small (the conditions are given above).             This is
necessary in the case of solutions in which the melting of the
ice is accompanied by change of concentration and therefore
of the freezing-temperature.          From the data, given below, it
will be seen that the velocity of warming or cooling the liquid
by the arrangements of the experiment, if t, —t'=0°4 or
 = –0°4 (in our method), is less than about 0°-0012 per
minute ; during the time of 15 minutes, which a freezing
point determination requires, the quantity of melted or
separated ice corresponds therefore to 0°-018, and the solution
becomes after 15 minutes of the experiment less dilute
or more concentrated by about 025 per cent. This is in
complete accordance with the direct experimental proof of the
same question (see footnote to the paper of P. B. Lewis,
Zeitschr. f. phys. Chem. vol. xv.).

Therefore we require to make readings at equal intervals of
time : 2, —21–23–22 = 21–2s and so on. But the reading
error is here of great importance if the temperature-intervals
are not very great.     Because of this we have to use the
#.reater temperature-intervals  and to make many readings.
       I. gives the convergence-temperature as obtained from
the first column of Table I.A.
    One is helped in obtaining the value of tº by plotting out
the results.     In     #=c(,-0,             t becomes=t,            when dt =0.
Taking the dt as ordinates, the t as abscissae, we get an almost
straight line which cuts the axis of abscissae at the conver
gence-temperature.   The observations must be made not very
far from the  convergence-temperature,  otherwise it may be
determined very erroneously.   In this way I obtained for a
convergence-temperature the results given in Table I.A.                            :-

                     II.  The Value         of C in      other Methods.
      A   beaker with 1250 c.c. water of the temperature 9°-6 was
   placed in a large liquid-bath (water) of the temperature 9°65.

        Freezing-Points and the Freezing-Point Methods.                                                   479
The liquid in the beaker was stirred by the porcelain stirrer
about 30 times per minute, and the temperature was measured
by the fine '01°-thernometer. The liquid-bath was stirred
from time to time to get a uniform temperature.       Hot water
was introduced into the beaker till the      temperature  of the
liquid rose about 1°2, and the time required for the passing
of the Hg-thread from one point of the thermometer-scale to
the other was measured to second.      I thus found for 1250 c.c.
water in a liquid-bath, C to be about 20 times greater than
in the air-bath. Now the velocity of cooling of a given
quantity of a liquid is inversely proportional to       quantity                           its
    volume and directly proportional         conducting surface.         its

 III.    The Determination                    of   the Temperature                  of   the   Air-bath.
  This was determined and found       about       higher than  to   be               4°
that of the ice-bath.   The measurements have been made in
such   away that the Tºgº thermometer was    first overcooled                   at
and allowed      rise               in

                                                                    to                                      it

   From the values                                              in the above table, it follows
                                           K (to-t.)
that the absolute values of the obtained freezing-temperatures
can be easily made so accurate as to be affected by errors
smaller than .00005° to .0001° if the convergence-temperature

     It is to be   seen from the above table that,                 if the convergence
                                                                                §§
temperature         is by     1°, -2°, below the freezing-temperature,
the difference         between the real and apparent freezing-temper
atures is not greater than .00002°-00004° as far as
is concerned, and so also when the variations of the con
vergence-temperature        are in a series of experiments only
“1”, “2°, -3°, the obtained freezing-temperature for one and the
same liquid, as well as the apparent and real freezing-point
depressions, cannot differ from one another more than by:00002°,
-00004°, or .00006°, as far as the equilibrium of the hetero
geneous system is concerned, as C" = about 15.
   The method with the convergence-temperature below the
freezing-temperature      is to be preferred to that with it above,
for the following reasons:—
   (1) The ice-cap need not be avoided.
    (2) Since C" is essentially greater than K, we are able
         more easily to reduce the experimental error and the
         variations of temperature, as far as the equilibrium of
        the system is concerned.
     I will
          now show how by the use of the results given above
to calculate the experimental error in other methods.      1st
earample: in a given method 70 c.c. liquid and a liquid-bath
at — 3° are used, and the quantity of ice present in the
liquid at equilibrium is equal to 3° overcooling.    Then we
have :-The value of C is found for 1250 c.c., about 20 times
greater if a liquid instead of an air-bath is used.       For
70 c.c. C is 2-7 times greater than for 1250 c.c., i.e., C is
54 times greater than mine.    Again to-toe is 3 times smaller

for a period of 180 months has produced about the same
degree of hardness as 66° acting for the period of 180 minutes.
One may infer with certainty, however, that 100° C. acting
for a period of minutes produces much greater softening than
atmospheric temperature acting for a like period of months.
In order to estimate the secular change of a resistance-standard
of any metal (cf. § 2), one should previously expose the wire
to the tempering effect of 100°, for a number of hours. One
may then     estimate the secular change of resistance of the
untempered   standard for any period of months to be rery much
less than the change of the tempered wire (100°) for a like period
of minutes. Two hours of annealing at 100° would thus
furnish the superior limit of change of the resistance-standard
within ten years. The same rule is applicable if the resistance
standard (as is preferable) is made of wire tempered at 100°
or more, as far as the limiting degree of softness".          This
tempering should be applied even after coiling, in order that
all molecular instability may       wiped out     far   be 100°                     as         as         at

suppose a semipermeable membrane separating water and a
dilute solution of sugar in water, the sugar molecules are to
be regarded as replacing some water molecules, but their
collisions on the water in the membrane are rendered inopera
tive by the shielding action of the framework, so that the
water molecules in the membrane receive more impacts on
the side of the pure water than on the side of the solution,
and therefore water flows through the membrane, until in the
solution there is enough excess of hydrostatic pressure estab
lished to compensate for the inoperative impacts of the sugar
molecules; this inequality of pressure which can be hydro
statically balanced is the csmotic pressure.                Next as to its

496               Mr. W. Sutherland        on the
liquids and gases at the same temperature; for it is involved in
the result that the equation for the osmotic pressure of the
dissolved sugar molecules comes out as if they were in the
gaseous state : many lines of investigation have already made
this identity tolerably certain, but none so simply and clearly
as van't Hoff's discovery of the identity of the osmotic
pressure laws with those of perfect gases.
   Van't Hoff has shown how, given semipermeability, it is
possible by thermodynamics to deduce the laws of dilute
s litions in a simple manner; the difficulty has been to get a
conception on molecular grounds of the rationale of osmotic
pressure and the simple laws of dilute solutions.    But with a
direct molecular    explanation for osmotic pressure we can then
adopt van't Hoff's thermodynamical extensions and treat the
whole matter as placed on a molecular basis; but for the sake
of the illustration we will essay a direct molecular explanation
of another typical simple law of dilute solutions, namely, that
of the lowering of vapour-tension.
   In a gas the average velocity and the average distance
 apart of the molecules are such that, although molecules are
continually approaching quite close to one another, they
seldom do so under conditions which would cause a pair to
remain within finite orbits relatively to one another; even
when two molecules collide, the relative path after the
collision is generally part of a curve extending to infinity,
just as the paths of comets are sometimes hyperbolas ; the
parabola is a possible orbit for a comet, and marks the tran
sition from the infinite hyperbola to the finite ellipse of
certain comets and the planets.        So in the case of a gas
which has molecular       velocity  lowered by cooling to the
critical  temperature,   and mean distance apart reduced by
compression up to the critical pressure, the relative orbits of
colliding molecules become restricted to a finite range, one
pair of molecules that have a hold on one another entangles
another similar pair, and so on ; the conditions are those of
 incipient liquefaction.   When the temperature is lowered,
liquefaction becomes decided, because of the more decided
 entanglement, and gravitation separates out the entangled
 portions into a continuous mass with horizontal surface, leaving
 more space to those which had high enough velocities to
 escape entanglement, and therefore still further increasing
 their chances of freedom, which they enjoy as vapour in
contact with the liquid. Solidification occurs when each
                                                         on
                             it its
 molecule is imprisoned by       neighbours,    or   the surface,

      so                        cannot escape. But suppose     a
liquid surrounding solid, then

  Thus a direct molecular explanation of the molecular
lowering of vapour-pressure in solutions is available, and
might be made the starting-point of the molecular theory of
solutions.
   It may be urged against the theory here outlined that it
makes no provision for the facts of the “dissociation ” of
salts in watery solution, so beautifully discovered by Arrhenius,
and worked out so consistently by Ostwald and the other
enthusiasts of the new Physical Chemistry; but it is easy to
provide for the facts of dissociation by stipulating that the
word molecule is to include any mass whose translational
kinetic energy is on the average that of a molecule of a gas at
the same temperature.      The electrically charged ion, if it is
really a separate kinetic entity, must, according to the kinetic
theory, be a molecule under the above stipulation; and thus
the requirements of the dissociation theory of watery solutions
of salts are met. Of course we should expect such dissociated
ions as Cl and Na to be very mobile, and to escape with ease
from the surface of a solution of NaCl; but as soon as they
get free from the liquid water which is the cause of their
dissociation, they will combine with avidity to form NaCl,
which then returns at once to the solution in the manner
described above. Thus dissociation presents no difficulty in
this connexion.       Evidently, the very marked dissociating
power of water is associated with          its generally exceptional
                                                                   i.

LXII.     Concerning Accidental Double Refraction in Liquids.
    Bu   J.  E. ALMY, A.M., Fellow in Physics, University of
    Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A.*
Th;in     question whether the condition of strain which occurs
           a mass of liquid, deformed by friction, gives rise to
double refraction of light, as does such condition in the case
of solids, has frequently been raised.
    Mach f, Maxwell f, Quincke $, and Kundt || have made
                                                                     .
observations of the phenomenon in liquids of different types:
Mach with extremely viscous substances, semi-solids; Max
well with Canada balsam ; and Kundt with the more nearl
fluid liquids, such as oils and solutions of gelatine, glue,
lodium, and balsam.
    Of Kundt's conclusions the following are significant
    1. “The magnitude of the internal friction (viscosity)
                                                                  :-
                                                                       of
liquids is not primarily sufficient to determine the occurrence
of double refraction.”
    2. The liquids and solutions which give double refraction are
oils, or belong to that class of substances known as colloids.
    3. Solutions of crystalline substances, without exception,
give no double refraction.           “However, it is not to be        in
ferred,” he adds, “that with improved means of investigation,
the effect may not be obtained with solutions of crystalline
substances.”
    It has been the purpose of this work to find whether double
refraction may be shown in liquids not oils, or with solutions
of crystalline substances. And, while double refraction has
not been obtained in either case, it has been possible to extend
the limit of accuracy with which the subject has been tested
by a factor of over 3× 10° in case of water, and by 10° in the
case of solutions of crystalline substances.
                                Apparatus.
    The apparatus used for producing the condition of strain
consists of two brass cylinders, each 10.8 cm. in diameter,
 15 cm. in length, mounted the one above the other, their
axes parallel, the surfaces of the two being about 0.4 cm.

A 4-H.P. electric motor furnished power for running the

light, passes through the polarizing Nicol and Lippich of the
polariscope, through the liquid between the cylinders, parallel
           <U+017F>º
to the axes of the cylinders, and out through the analyser. The
polariscope, a “Lippich half-shade’’ instrument, has an ad
justable            so that the amount of light admitted can be
varied   according   as the liquid is more or less opaque.

liquids is proportional to the relative velocity of the cylinders,
by having doubled the relative velocity and increased the
sensibility of the optical system by a factor of 150, the limit
to which the non-occurrence of accidental double refraction
has been proved is extended by a factor of 3 × 10°.

that of either of the outer ones.   But viewed along the field
the middle line would      disappear, as the exciting vibration
would be end on to the observer and could not therefore send
out transverse radiation : the other lines (equally sharp as
before) would be circularly polarized, and their directions of
polarization would, as Zeeman remarks, determine whether
the vibrator involves a positive or a negative electron.
   4. A view has been enunciated that it is only one kind of
ions, namely the negative ones, that are mobile and free to
vibrate in the atom or molecule, the other kind being fixed to
the matter and immobile.            On such an hypothesis, if the
charges of these    negative    ions are proportional to their effec
tive masses, for example if they are simple electrons without
inertia other than that of the electric charge, the intervals
(measured in difference of frequency) between magnetic
doublets and the outside lines of magnetic triplets in the
spectrum should be the same for                lines.    Moreover, theyall
should         be
           the same        different spectra.

ON relating to drag on armature conductors, enclosed or
nearly enclosed in iron, Prof. H. du Bois contributed an
article in the Elektrotechnische Zeitschrift of August 19 last
(a translation of which appeared in the ‘Electrician' of
August 27), in the course of which attention was particularly
directed to a phenomenon of ring magnets.        Prof. du Bois
writes:—A ring-magnet                                 experiences a side thrust when in an
eaternal field whose lines of force are in the same plane as the
ring; and conversely it everts a thrust in the opposite direction
upon the supporter of the eaternal field.” “This deduction,”
he adds, “so astonishing at first sight,           have proved to be               I
verified by experiment.”        As                               its

                                                       is         a                  is

with the substance dissolved. But although such theory explains                      a

                     Notices respecting    New Books.                  515
much to me,     I  cannot consider my opinion as proved, and there
fore give it with some reserve as one of several hypotheses. . . . If
in solutions I see and can frequently prove distinct evidences of
the existence of those definite compounds which form the more
generalized province of chemical data,         I  could not refrain from
going into certain details respecting solutions; otherwise there
would have remained no trace of that general idea, that in them
we have only a certain instance of ordinary definite or atomic
compounds, subject to Dalton's laws.”
    In accordance with this statement many allusions to the current
theories of solution will be found throughout the work, generally
in the form of foot-notes.       A summary of the two aspects of the
solution question, the physical and the chemical, is given in a
lengthy note, running through pages 64–67 of the first volume,
and from this it will be seen that the author does not regard these
apparently conflicting views as irreconcilable.         At the same time
he correctly points out that solution cannot be a purely physical
phenomenon since it “does not take place between any two
substances, but requires a special and particular attraction             or
 affinity between them.”         In other words, the purely  -    chemical
aspect of solution cannot be ignored.                                      -
    In noticing the first English edition some six years ago we had
 occasion to call attention to the suggestiveness of the foot-notes,
and a re-examination of the present edition from this point of
 view will serve to bring out even more forcibly the extraordinary
 breadth of the author's grasp of his subject.        All the fundamental
 philosophical conceptions which have been introduced into chemical
 science appear to have been considered, not simply in the
 perfunctory “professorial” sense, but with the calm deliberation
 of an original mind given to weigh doctrines as well as to enunciate
 them in the lecture-room.         Many of the notes are in fact of the
 nature of disquisitions on special doctrines, and are often complete
 from the historical point of view as well as concise in literary
 treatment. It remains only to indicate that there is a marked
 improvement      in the translation of the present edition, and the
 ambiguities which were observable here and there in the text of
 the earlier edition have been removed.           The third appendix of
 the former edition is now       replaced  by a  paper   on Argon written
 in   1895,  which is   extremely    interesting   as  indicating  that the
 author still had a lingering idea that this gas might be a polymeric
 condition of nitrogen formed under natural as distinguished from
 artificial laboratory conditions.     Helium was too recent a discovery
 to be treated of at length, and one can only regret that we have
 not the advantage of Mendeléeff's latest and most matured views
 on the influence of the discovery of these inert gases on the
 periodic arrangement of the elements.          In confirming the favour
 able   opinion   which was     formerly   expressed    with respect to the
 value of this treatise—an     opinion   which the new edition enhances
  in a very high degree—we may add that both translator and
  editor have done their work remarkably well.                          --
