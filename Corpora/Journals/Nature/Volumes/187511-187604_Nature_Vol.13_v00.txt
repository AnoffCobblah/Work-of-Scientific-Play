AMERICAN GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS*
THE volumes which record the progress of the United
States Geological Survey of the Territories since its
commencement in 1867 contain much information of great
value to geologists, as well as to those who watch with
intelligent interest the advance of the wave of human
civilisation into the far West. Each of them is full of
fresh illustrations of the principles of geology, such as the
dependence of scenery upon rocky structure, the order of
succession of formations, the plication of mountain-
chains, the phenomena of volcanic action, the functions
of rivers and glaciers as geological agents—illustrations
which have already to some extent found their way into
general text-books and are no doubt destined ere long to
be made in that way familiar even to tyros in the science
all over the world. In each of them too we have such
information as could be gathered as to the agricultural
value of the countries, the practicable routes for roads
and railways, the mineral resources to be looked for, the
facilities for general commerce—information which will

probably serve as the basis for the future development of
the regions into settled States.
During the years 1871 and 1872 Dr. Hayden's parties
were at work about the sources of the Missouri and Yel-
lowstone Rivers. They had gradually pushed on into
that wild region, stimulated by the variety and interest
of its scenery and geology, but they had got far from
any civilised base-line, including railroads and other con-
veniences of transport and subsistence. Beyond them
lay the lands of the Indians, who manifested no disposi-
tion to treat the peaceful work of the Survey in another
light than as some insidious part of the designs of the
grasping central power at Washington. It seemed desir-
able therefore in the meantime to discontinue the further
prosecution of the Sutvey in the north-west until by the
establishment of railioad communication it could be
resumed with much less labour and cost. This delay,
howevtr, will probably not be of long continuance, when

we consider with what marvellous rapidity the tide of
American energy is travelling towards the Pacific.
The region recommended by Dr. Hayden and approved
of by the Government as the scene to which the operations
of the Survey should be transferred was that portion of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the Rocky Mountain range which runs through Colorado
and New Mexico—a region as yet unsurveyed and liksly
in a few years to be rapidly developed by some of the
most important railroads of the West. The survey of the
fortieth parallel by Mr. Clarence King, to which allusion
has been already made, and of which some account will
be given in a subsequent paper, had done good service in
making known the physical features and geology of a
belt of country stretching across the northern limits of
the tract which Dr. Hayden now proposed to examine.
That survey would form the starting-point of the new
explorations which it was arranged should sweep west-
ward across the watershed of the continent to the left
bank of the Green and Colorado Rivers, eastward across
the sources and higher course of the Platte, Arkansas,
and other tributaries of the Mississippi, and southwards
to the boundary-line between the United States and
Mexico.
The first instalment of results from this transference of
area has appeared in the Annual Report of the Geolo-
gical Survey of the Territories for 1873—a thick volume

graphically and geologically, an area of 5,600 square
miles during the period between the end of May and the
latter part of October; the third division, under Dr.
F. M. Endlich, accomplished the survey of nearly 7,600
square miles, "particular attention being paid to the
agricultural and mineralogical resources of the country
traversed." Allowing 130 full working days for the
period during which these two parties were at work, we
find that on an average 100 square miles were surveyed
topographically and geologically each day, and that this
was performed by some seven or eight observers! And
if it be further noted that only half of that number were
geologists, and that in the case of the San Luis, or third
division, the geological work appears to have been done by
one man, we shall form some notion of the rate at which
scientific surveys advance in the far West. We have not
the same precise statements of the area actually surveyed
by the second or South Park division, under Dr. A. C.
Peale; but it seems to have been on the same extensive
scale.
Now by those who take interest in the progress of
topographical and geological surveying some explanation
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
will naturally be required as to the almost incredibly large
area examined in one season by Dr. Hayden's corps.
Compared with his rate of progress, our Ordnance and
Geological Surveys creep on at a snail's pace. His
geologists, for instance, get over in a single day an
amount of ground which the most hard-working and
experienced members of the Geological Survey of Great
Britain could| hardly accomplish in a year's campaign.
Evidently the two kinds of work cannot properly be com-
pared with each other. That of the British Surveys is
minutely detailed, and meant to be, for the time, exhaus-
tive. The American Survey of the Territories, on the
other hand, cannot be regarded as, and does not pretend
to be, more than a rapid but intelligent reconnaissance,
wherein the positions of the leading landmarks are cor-
rectly determined, and those of the intermediate features
are fixed as nearly as may be; while, acting in concert
with the topographer, and availing himself of the same
points of observation, the geologist ascertains the nature
and order of the rocks in a few traverses from which he
infers what must be the structure of the surrounding dis-
tricts. It is no disparagement to this work to say that it
must in the end be superseded by more accurate and
detailed surveys. It is in the meanwhile doing a notable
service by pioneering in vast and unknown or little known
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
regions, and giving the world a first outline of the main
features of their geography and geology. In the territory
of Central Colorado investigated in 1873, the geologists
had the advantage of comparatively simple structure to
deal with. So clearly does the skeleton of the continent
protrude in that region through the surface, that from each
main hill-top it was not difficult to follow for many miles
on successive ridges and spurs the crags and hollows
marking the lines of outcrop of particular strata. The
extent to which this peculiarity and simplicity of geolo-
gical physiography has been useful, may be inferred from
the numerous diagram-sections of the belt of country sur-
veyed, showing the relation of the surface-contour to the
arrangement of the underlying rocks.
Space cannot be given here for a detailed account of
this Report, but reference may be made to some of its
features which have a general interest. Mountain-struc-
ture, especially in relation to the plications of the crust of
the earth, receives much notice from the various mem-
bers of the Survey. They have followed the gradual
swelling of the flat formations of the plains, first into gentle

out of the older flows, while coulees were poured down the
excavated hollows. In these respects the history of this
late North American volcanic action recalls the succes-
sion of events so long ago and so admirably described by
Mr. Poulett Scrope as traceable among the volcanic
masses of Central France.
The mines now in operation, as well as indications of
probable positions for new ones, are carefully noted in
the Report. The geologists, indeed, have constantly had
before them the consciousness that the future develop-
ment of these territories would not be helped so much by
their making out all geological details at present as by
their ascertaining what practicable places could be found
fcr the establishment of mining industry. At the same
time, they deserve great credit for keeping the thoroughly
scientific character of their duty so conspicuous in their
reports; for undoubtedly the only way to make an explo-
ration which shall be of real value as a guide in mining
operations is to do it in the strictest sense geologically.
With the area and relations of the different rock-forma-
tions mapped out for him, the mining prospector may
save much time and money by learning what tracts to

avoid as well as which to explore.
Each of the geologists in command of a division under
Dr. Hayden furnishes a report, which appears in the present
volume. These are remarkably well done, that of Mr.
Maivine being specially interesting from the variety of
phenomena with which he had to deal and the clearness
with which he tells his story. Besides the geological
reports, Prof. Lesquercux supplies one of great value on
the Lignitic formation and its fossil flora, in which he
enters anew into the vexed question of the true age of
that formation. As the result of his long study of its
large and well-marked flora, he concludes that the forma-
tion is of Tertiary date, a conclusion which agrees also
with that to which Dr. Hayden has been ltd. A large list
of new species of fossil plants from the Lignitic strata is
described by him in his report. Under the head of
Zoology are gathered a number of communications on
insects, Crustacea, mollusca, and oiher invertebrata, col-
lected or observed during the progress of the Survey.
The part devoted to Geography and Topography contains
the reports of the geographer and his colleagues on the
system of triangulation employed, the heights of various
places, the practicable routes, and other matters. The
book is well printed and well illustrated. It deserves

ALIX ON THE LOCOMOTION OF BIRDS
Essai sur I'Appareil Locomotatr des Oiseaux. By
Edmond Alix, M.D. (Paris: G. Masson.)
THIS considerable volume, the first independent
work of any pretensions on the osteology and
myology of birds, is a valuable addition both to zoo-
logical and to ornithological literature. As far as the
latter is concerned it would have been more distinctly
useful if the author had been better acquainted prac-
tically with birds' skins, as well as with the binomial
nomenclature and the importance of specific distinc-
tions. If he had, such a sentence as the following
would have been modified in a manner which would have
made it of greater value to future investigators, at the
same time that the precision would have added weight to
the points brought forward. We are told with reference
to the accessory femoro-caudal muscle that "this fasci-
culus, represented in the Cormorant by an aponeurotic
band, is found uncomplicated in the Grebe, Flamingo,

racters indicated by the presence or absence of the carina,
it is almost impossible to recognise in the sternum any
of those distinguishing features which may be stated in a
single word, or may be incorporated as a definition in any
tabular arrangement. The sternums of most birds, even
those which are most peculiar, must be considered in their
entirety, and a complete description is necessary for their
differentiation." We would feel disposed to go even
further than this, and to say that in the sternum there are
characters from which, with a little extraneous assistance,
more considerable generalisations may be arrived at. It
is true that in the passerine Pteroptochui the posterior
margin is doubly notched on either side, but in how
different a manner from that in the piciform birds and
owls! What more than the sternum proves the closeness
of the relationship between the Toucans, Woodpeckers,
andCapitocs, also between the Swifts and the Humming
Birds, as well as the small kinship between the galli-
naceous birds and the Sand Grouse? On the other hand,
the sternum does not aid us much in the determination
of more distant relationships, such as those of families
one to the other. From it alone we should not feel

justified in placing the Tinamous near the Apteryx, nor
the Stormy Petrels near the Fulmars.
In the Bulletin de la SocitU Philomathique and in the
Journal de Zoologic Dr. Alix has published his dissec-
tions of the Rhea and of a Tinamou (Nolkura major).
His myological investigations are based on the descrip-
tions given by Vic d'Azyr and Meckel. Following the
latter of these, he mentions that in the Cormorant the
ambiens muscle {accessoire iliaquc du fltchisseur per/ore')
is absent, which is decidedly not the case in the common
species (Thalacrocorav carbd). With reference to this
bird, the accessory femorocaudal is said to be repre-
sented by an aponeurotic band, which we have failed to
detec'. ; and the same remark applies to the muscle itself
in the Heron (Ardca cinerca), in which it is also said to
be developed; from which we may infer that the author
has evidently not clearly recognised the characters which
distinguish this fleshy fasciculus from the obturator exter-
nus {cam); and that such is the case is further proved
by his statement that the latter named muscle is enormous
in the ostrich, in which it is in reality very small, being
almost hidden by the former.

This muscle in birds is not a single one, but is formed of
a superficial and a deep group; the latter having two
separate origins, an internal and an external, of which the
relative proportionate bulks vary. Those birds in which
the outer head is the larger are termed ectomyensj those
with a larger internal head, entomyens; and those with
equal heads, homaiomyens. "The palimpeds, the longi-
rostral and pressirostral Waders, the Flamingoes, the
Storks, the Tinamous, the struthious birds and the Parrots,
are entomyen; the Herons, the Rails, the gallinae, Pigeons
and passeres, are homceomyen; whilst the diurnal and
nocturnal birds of prey are ectomyen." The deep flexors
are said not to offer such remarkable differences as those
just referred to, but as none of their most striking pecu-
liarities are mentioned, we presume that the author is
unacquainted with them. The long flexor tendon to the
hind toe, we are told, is absent in the swan; it may be
so in Cygnus ofar, such is certainly not the case in
C. nigricollis.

the greater part of the journey recorded was through Kash-
mirian territory. But the two works differ in many
respects in design and plan. Mr. Drew has brought
together so full and trustworthy a mass of information of
all kinds about Kashmir as must render his work the
great authority on the subject for a long time to come;
his style is perfectly plain and unadorned ; nearly every

many words in admiration of the unparalleled scenery in
the midst of which he lived for ten years, and he is never
tempted into rapture. The attraction of Mr. Drew's work,
and it is distinctly attractive, lies in the high interest and
value and frequent novelty of the information contained
in it. Mr. Wilson's aim, on the other hand, is to enable
the reader to share, as far as words can go, the sensations
which he himself felt in journeying for weeks in the midst
of scenery whose grandeur cannot be adequately expressed,
to present an impressive panoramic view of the "peaks,
passes, and glaciers," and the fearful ravines of the
highest mountains in the world, and to picture the scanty
life which lurks in their lofty valleys or clings to their

Without apparent effort or artifice the current of his
narrative flows on with delightful sweep; his style is
vigorous, clear, and really eloquent, never bombastic
or stilted, and with an under-current of genuine humour.
He follows the only scientific method of reproducing in
his readers the impressions made upon himself by the
Himalayan scenery—by representing in simple but striking
language the features which stirred his admiration and
awe, never indulging in those futile and vague expres-
sions of ecstasy which are a mark of the feeble observer,
unscientific thinker, and unskilled writer. At the same
time Mr. Wilson manages to convey a very considerable
amount of information, and whoever reads his work with
care will have realised to some extent the character of
the region which it attempts to describe.
Mr. Wilson's main object in undertaking his toilsome

tour among the Western Himalayas was to invigorate a
constitution prostrated by the trying climate of India.
His original intention was simply to visit Masuri and
Simla, "but the first glimpse of the Jumnotri and Gangotri
peaks excited longings which there was no need to re-
strain," and he plunged into the heart of the Himalayas.
His journey lasted from June to November 1873. His
real starting-point was Simla, though he gives valuable
information as to other routes, and makes many shrewd
comments on the men and manners of the various places
through which he passed before reaching this point, on
society and politics, and on certain burning questions
connected with our Indian Empire. From Simla he
proceeded up the stifling valley of the Sutlej to Shipki,
where he made a vain attempt to get into Chinese Tibet;
he was worsted by the women of the place. Hence he
proceeded in a generally north-west direction by the Lee
River, through the Schinkal pass, past Padam in Zanskar,
to Dras, visiting Sirinagar and the Vale of Kashmir, and
on westwards by the Jhelam River to the Khyber Pass.

turned to these subjects and of his having hit upon
shorter, simpler, and more effectual modes of obtaining
certain results.
After a personal narrative, he tells us he bought a
guitar. "The guitar having only six strings Id perform a
melody which may require sixteen whole tones, besides
semi-tones, to be effected by shortening the strings by
fingering, 1 had now a fair field open for my calculations.
So I conceived a musical instrument of sixteen strings
similar to the guitar, which would require no shortening
of the strings by fingering, but which could be played
straight ahead, each string representing a different note,
like the harp. Now, all my stock-in-trade in mathematical
science was a knowledge of the properties of the right-
angled triangle, which, connected with the rule of propor-
tion known as the Rule of Three in arithmetic, seemed like a
magic key to unlock the mysteries connected with geometry
and trigonometry.'' He then dwells on the properties of the
right-angled triangle. The espscial property is the dis-
covery imputed to Pythagoras. This he expects is of
''greater value than any other axiom in mathematics."
He simplifies "this simple axiom, and if you want it any
plainer, the only way is to set your own brains to work."
With his Minstrel (the musical instrument) he has plenty
of amusement. "I would be so absorbed in calculating

and committing the numbers arrived at to memory as to
be quite unconscious I had lost my sight. The outer
world was invisible, but the inner world of the spirit was
transparent." He then comes to his main point, viz., the
true mode of obtaining the distances of remote objects
by observation. "My mind must have been occupied on
this theorem for five or six years, and it was not until a
year after the recovery of the sight of one eye that I dis-
covered the principle. At length it came to my mind
like a flash of lightning, first to find the correspondence of
the circle to the square; and then to obtain trie distance
by the proportion of the paralax (sic) to the length of the
square for a divisor, and the length of the base line mea-
sured or obtained as the multiplier. . . . The principle
itself is perfect, and the approximation to perfection in its
application depends altogether on the comparative per-
fection of the instrument used and of the observations
made."

Prof. Mohr's interesting observations on the internal heat of the

between the depths of 700 and 3,390 feet, there will cease to be
any increase at all in the temperature exactly at the depth of one

The reason of the discrepancy between this result and that

a recent number of the periodical, of wl.ich he is a joint
edi'or, a most suggestive paper, entitled "Some Remarks
upon a Fluctuating Character in the Human Hand."* As
the line of research is somewhat uncommon, and may, for
au.^ht we know, be productive of important results, the
substance of Prof. Ecker's paper is here presented to
English readers in an abridged form.
Henle, in his work on Anatomy, has made the observa-
tion that people have very vague ideas about objects even
which are assumed to be well known; c.%. the query is
often put. How many feet has a crab? or, How many toes
has a cat ?—questions which receive most varying answers
ever in well-informed and educated circles.
If, then, the question be put in the company of half a
dozen people, which finger is the longest—the index
(forefinger) or the "ring" (fourth) linger?—the query can
but seldom be answered before the members in ques-
tion have been looked at. It seems, further, very probable
that the authors of well-known anatomical works have
laid down as being the rule that which they have observed
on their own hands, so that we are enabled to tell in what
respect, as to digital arrangement, such and such savant

is endowed. For instance—Weber says that the "ring"
finger is only slightly shorter than the index ; Carus holds
that the latter digit is shorter than the ring finger ; Henle
is of the same opinion ; while, according to Hyrtl, it is
the index which comes next to the middle finger (the
longest) in length ; and Langer, lastly, says that the index
is generally shorter than the "ring " finger, but that there
are individuals in whom they are nearly of the same
length.
Have these variations a morphological significance or
not? For the solution of this, answers to the following
questions are necessary :—
(a) How are the animals which come next after man,
in other words, the apes, and especially the anthropo-
morphous apes,f off in this particular?
• (;i) What is the case with the lower races of mankind
in the same particular?
(y) What is the most usual digital arrangement in this
respect among the European races of man? and lastly,
(8) Which proportion of the two digits in question has
been accepted as the most beautiful and symmetrical, and
either knowingly or unknowingly adopted in art?
1. With regard to the Ape, the index is—and often
considerably—shorter than the "ring" finger. The dif-
ference in length is much more considerable in the

Chimpanzee than in the Gorilla ; the greatest difference,
that of 20 mm., having been found in the cast of a hand
of a male Chimpanzee.
2. Drawings—made by placing the hand upon paper,
the axis of the middle digit coinciding with a straight
line at right angles to the front or hind margin of the
paper, supposing the latter to be a parallelogram, and
then following the outline of the fingers with a pencil—
were made of twenty-five male and twenty-four female
negroes, with the following result :—
(a) Among the males twenty-four had the " ring" finger
longest, the average difference being 8 mm., while in the
remaining instance both fingers were of the same length.
(6) Out of the females the " ring" finger was longest in
fifteen, the difference varying from 2 to 14 mm.; in three
the fingers were of the same length; while in six the
index was the longer, the difference being from 2 to
6 mm.
Prof. Ecker has further found the " ring" finger longest
in casts and in several photographs of the hands of
negroes ; but in the hand of a " Turco" negro the index

SCIENCE IN GERMANY
(From a German Correspondent?)
IT ERR NEESEN, assistant to Prof. Ilclmholtz, has
¦*¦ * recently published a memoir on the phenomena of
attraction and repulsion by light and heat-rays, observed
by Mr. Crookes. He states in it that he had already for
two years observed such phenomena, which at first
seemed to be a case of mechanical action of light-rays,
i.e. of the effect of their impinging and rebounding on the
surface of a mirror suspended by a cocoon-fibre. He
"now thinks, however, from the experiments he has made,
that the effects of light and heat-rays in question are to
be regarded as merely produced through air-currents
arising from heating of the air in certain parts of the
apparatus in which the movements of the mirror take
place. Neesen first shows that in the phenomena ob-
served such air-currents have, in fact, influence. He
used for his experiments a rectangular case of sheet iron,
in the upper cover of which was a peculiar arrangement
for hanging a cocoon fibre. In the lower part of one of
the sides of the case was a rectangular aperture closed by
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
a plane parallel glass plate, and behind this plate was the
suspended mirror. The air-currents above referred to
arise not only from the fact that the air in contact with
the glass plate through which the light must pass to reach
the mirror, or the air in contact with the mirror, is heated.
The air-particles also between glass plate and mirror are
heated by conduction of the heat; and so, by their heat-
ing also, air-currents are produced which tend to turn the
mirror.
In favour of Neesen's explanation are the facts (1) that
the movements of the mirror always decrease when the
air in which it is enclosed is rarefied ; and (2) that these
movements also become less if adiathermanous sub-
stances {eg. a column of water) absorb the light-rays
before these can reach the mirror.
The considerations which seem to be against his ex-
planation are the following :—(1) The reversal of the
movement, observed by Mr. Crookes, on a certain small air
pressure being reached ; (2) a fact appearing from Neesen's
own experiments, viz , that according as the direction in
which the light-rays fell on the mirror was varied, was the
direction of rotation of the mirror changed, though the
light fell on the same part of the mirror. Both these
peculiarities, however, may also be explained by air-
currents. First, as regards the fact observed by Neesen,
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
it is clear that, according as the lamp is placed to one side
or the other of the mirror, different parts of the glass
plate in front are heated, and different parts of the air-
layer between glass plate and mirror; and accordingly
the currents and the rotation of the mirror must have an
opposite direction. To explain the reversal of the motion
on a certain low pressure being reached, Neesen calls to
mind that the conductivity of air for heat, as Kundt and
Warburg have shown, decreases with extraordinary ra-
pidity on decrease of pressure (well observed with low
pressures); so that with as perfect a vacuum as possible,
it entirely disappears, and only radiation of heat remains.
Now, as long as the heat is conducted, the air-particles
conducting the heat are themselves heated. On the
other hand, no such heating takes place when the heat
passes only by radiation. That with such very different
conditions the currents may be different is probable in a
high degree. W.

FA YE ON THE LA IVS OF STORMS*
Mechanical Identity of Waterspouts and Eddies.—The
question then is reduced to this, viz., whether, when in the
middle of the most profound calm these destructive
waterspouts are [seen to appear, the form of which corre-
sponds so well to the eddies formed in streams of water, we
can point to any current by [which the phenomenon has
been originated. Now this is precisely what we intended
to set in strong relief in describing the general currents
of the atmosphere. The counter-trades clearly show that
there exist above our heads unmistakable currents of air
in motion. Without even recurring to considerations of
this nature, it is enough to cast our eyes over the heavens
on the appearance of a waterspout, in order to see by the
march of the clouds that in spite of the calm below,
powerful horizontal currents prevail aloft, which, as their
different parts cannot advance at the same rate, must
consequently give rise to whirling movements of a more
or less decided character. If one of these whirls meet
with the favourable circumstances so often seen in water-
streams, it will be regularly developed by taking the form
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
which analysis assigns to it; by its downward movement
it will even penetrate through into the calm strata, the
resistance of which will gradually alter its form and its
course, and end by reaching the ground. This simple
notion of the mechanical identity of gyrations, whether of
liquids or gases, furnishes at once the explanation of phe-
nomena which meteorologists have laboured to find in an
entirely different range of ideas. Waterspouts contain
powerful forces in action, because they draw the force
from a medium above, where it is in abundance; they
march onwards because they follow the current which
originates them; at their base they are slightly curved,
not forwards but backwards, because the comparatively
still medium they traverse offers a certain amount of re-
sistance ; they act nevertheless in the same manner both
on the ground and over water, whatever be the curvature
of the conical tube which descends from the clouds,
because this curvature never interferes with the direction
of the axis of rotation of each spiral, but only with the
succession of these spirals in space, &c.
This identity of waterspouts in air and of eddies in
water, which is so complete in a mechanical and geome-
trical point of view, is no longer to be looked at altogether
from the physical standpoint, on account of the differences
which in this respect exist between water and gas. In-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
deed, the temperature of a stream of water is almost the
same at all depths; in the air, on the contrary, heat
decreases markedly as we rise to the higher strata.
Further, the moisture of the air is liable to be condensed
for a fall of temperature often very slight. Thence the
cold air of the high regions, drawn gradually downward
by the whirling movement into the low and moist strata,
generates a thin mist all round the waterspout. This
mist serves as an outer envelope or sheath, the form
of which is more or less sharply marked, being ren-
dered visible by its opacity. There is no doubt that the
air in its descent is subjected to an increasing pressure
and gradually rises in temperature; but it is lower than
the temperature of the surrounding air, and it is enough
if it falls to the dew-point of the general mass of air sur-
rounding it in order that the nebulous sheath may be
immediately produced. If the difference of the two tem-
peratures is insufficient, or if the humidity is too low in
any particular stratum, the misty sheath will not be
formed, and the waterspout will in part be invisible.
None the less, however, will it be there, though it seem

12
[Nov. 4, 1875
NA TURE
to be visible. The illusion of the observer lies in attri-
buting to the interior of the waterspout the movements
which really take place round and outside its exterior
margin.
The part played by electricity has been thus stated by
Peltier, who supposed he had detected traces of this force
in the well-known waterspout of Monville. The sheath
of vapour is in some sort a continuation of the electrically-
charged clouds; it forms a long conductor of about eight
hundred feet between the clouds and the ground, a con-
ductor doubtless very imperfect, but on a great scale, and
capable of affording to some extent a passage to the
electricity. It is, however, far from being comparable
with the destructive characteristics of the thunderbolt.
The way in which trees overturned by whirlwinds are
sometimes broken up has been recognised as resembling
more or less that of trees struck by ligh'ning and shat-
tered into splinters; but this effect is only the result of
the violent torsion exerted by the gyratory movement of
the whirlwind, and not of the sudden passage of anelectri-
cal current. Men and animals have often been caught by

whirlwinds and injured, without ever experiencing the
least electrical shock.
Thus the essential characteristic of these remarkable
movements which produce waterspouts or great tornadoes
is a circular gyration, the spirals being slightly inclined to
the horizon. Wherever you make a section of it, you
only find there concentric circles with the radii always
converging towards a centre. In representing them geo-
metrically you need not hesitate between the circular
diagrams of Reid, Redfield, and Piddington, and the dia-
grams with converging rays of some learned meteoro-
logists, the victims of a hypothesis and old prejudice.
The former diagrams reproduce the mechanical pheno-
menon in its essentials; the latter answer to a mere
illusion which a little reflection should ages since have
exploded.
Extension of this Identity to Cyclones.—The last step
only remains to extend these conclusions to great tor-
nadoes, that is, typhoons, and lastly to cyclones, which
often overspread a vast extent of territory. It is one of
the characteristic properties of the eddies generated in
currents of water, that they arc formed on every scale,
even the largest, without undergoing any essential change.
Eddies may be a few inches in diameter, a few yards, a
few furlongs, or even of still larger dimensions ; it is the

breadth of the currents where they are generated which
alone limits their size. In the ocean there are gyrations
on a still vaster scale, or even on a scale altogether
colossal, such as the vast currents of the Atlantic which
circle round the calm region of the Sargasso Sea. The
sun presents the phenomena of whirling movements still
better defined and of all dimensions, from large openings
equalling our cyclones, even to those large spots which are
five or six times greater than the earth itself. In like
manner, in the whirling movements of our atmosphere
are found small, short-lived eddies of a few feet in dia-
meter, whirlwinds and waterspouts, which last longer,
from 10 to 200 yards across, and tornadoes from
about J to 1 \ mile in diameter. Beyond this the eye
cannot take in the forms of the whirling columns;
these receive another name, but in all essential points
they remain the same. When the dimensions are still
greater, the diameters measuring 300 miles and upwards,
they bear the name of hurricanes or cyclones ; but not-
withstanding this, their mechanism remains unchanged.
They are always gyratory, circular movements increasing

NATURE
this general dilatation in the torrid zone takes place under
the vertical rays of the sun. In this manner the centre
of gravity of the lower strata rises vertically; these raise
the strata above them, which being specifically lighter, dry
and transparent, are consequently less sensitive to the
sun's rays. All the strata in succession, thus thrust up-
ward above their surface of normal height, tend to flow
with accelerated motion along these surfaces in the direc-
tion of the two poles, where the temperature is relatively
low. This effect is still further increased by the peculiar
march of the aqueous vapour which is principally con-
densed about the poles, whence it returns to the equator
by another way than that of the atmosphere, viz., along
the surface of the earth in the liquid state.
The atmosphere cannot exactly follow the diurnal
rotation. A half of its mass, or from about 300 lat. S. to
350 lat N., lags somewhat behind, since all the molecules
in this region being thrust upward describe circles con-
tinually increasing in size with the linear velocity from
the lower level from which they started in their ascent.
To this retardation must be superadded that of the sur-

face trades resulting from their general flow towards the
equatorial region. Beyond the tropics, on the contrary,
in the temperate zones where the air advances into paral-
lels of latitude continually diminishing in size, the other
half of the atmosphere flows in advance of the earth's
rotation. Towards the polar circles this advance is con-
verted into a circling movement round the two poles from
west to east.
The unequal distribution of land and water over the
globe modifies this general aerial current, so that it does
not flow on in one current, but is broken up into many
currents—the equalities of the surface throwing the
current of the counter-trades into several currents
more or less distinct from each other. We can easily
imagine the behaviour of the counter-trades by com-
bining their march toward the poles with the two oppo-
site transverse tendencies of which we are about to
speak. Between the tropics, the resulting currents do not
blow straight to the equator, but wear round more toward
a westerly direction. Beyond the tropics, they do not
blow directly toward the poles, but take a course inclined
more to eastward. The two following figures will explain
our meaning :—
Fig. 13 represents the whole upper currents for both
hemispheres on a projection of the meridian; and Fig.

14 for the northern hemisphere on a projection of the
equator. The dotted arrows mark the surface counter-
currents; in other words, the trade-winds blowing
obliquely towards the equator, making nearly a right
angle with the upper trades of the torrid zone. A slow
whirling movement may also be seen around both poles
resulting from the counter-trades. These really exist, for
the meteorologists of the United States have recently
described them under the name, a little fanciful, perhaps,
of polar cyclones.
The aerial rivers which are marked out in the midst of
these great movements, by which the equilibrium, inces-
santly disturbed, tends constantly to re-establish itself,
exhibit then precisely the course which we have recognised
as a peculiarity of the trajectories of cyclones, whilst the
surface-trades have no relation to these same curves show-
ing the courses of cyclones. This agreement is a further
proof that cyclones must have their origin in the upper

hand, where the column is narrowed to a very great
extent, and where the velocity of the gyrations is exces-
sive, the obstacles met with exercising little influence, are
instantly reversed or overcome. Waterspouts acting by
the lower extremity, at a distance from their funnel-shaped
top {embouchure), undergo no change; but cyclones will
not withstand the forces brought into play so easily.
Let the modifications thus induced by external causes
be what they may, the preceding theory shows that they
are possible, and that the rigorously circular movement
enunciated by the authors of the "Laws of Storms"
allows of perturbations more or less local, and more
or less marked, for the simple reason that the
whirling movements, which in the case of cyclones
are reduced to their upper portions and are there-
fore little more than mere discs, are very easily
modified. It is this, moreover, which explains the de-
viations from the rule that are found in even the earliest
writings of the authors of the " Laws of Storms," as, for
example, in Fig. 1 (vol. xii. p. 401), representing the Cuba
hurricane, where, notwithstanding the general agreement

of the arrows showing the wind with the purely circular
theory of storms, there also occur several local deviations.
What can these perturbations be? How can a gyra-
tory movement be changed under the influence of a given
external cause? What happens if the velocities of the
generating current undergo local changes? It would be
as difficult to answer these inquiries a priori as it would
have been to foresee, before the development of the
mechanical theory of solid bodies, the astonishing results
of an external force brought to bear on them; but the
study of other whirling movements more within the reach
of observation, and directed to the sun, has shown that
a cyclone is not arbitrarily deformed in any manner
whatever. Segmentation, or breaking up of the cyclone,
is the last term of the alterations which it can undergo.
Then the fragments into which it is broken up tend to
assume the form of cyclones, each as perfect as the one
from which they were formed, and they follow routes dif-
fering but little from each other and describing nearly
the same trajectory, but at a distance from each other.
This segmentation of cyclones occasionally occurs in the
case of the thunderstorms which advance on France from
the Bay of Biscay, of which the thunderstorm of the 9th
of March, 1865, so well described by M. Marid-Davy,
may be cited as an example. A like process of segmen-

tation cannot take effect unless the primitive cyclone in
some part and for some time deviate from its rigorously
circular form. The tendency to keep this form maintains
the ascendency sometimes, but if it begins to give way in
a large cyclone, the result is a breaking up of the cyclone
itself into segments.
It would be easy to adduce numerous cases in which
whirlwinds, tornadoes, and cyclones appear in groups
about a given point, or at least follow each other with
rapidity. The evidence all goes to show that they are
most frequently the result of the phenomenon of segmen-
tation, so called from the term used in natural history to
designate the process by which some of the lower animals
arc divided into segments each of which soon becomes a
complete animal of itself. But it is in solar cyclones
where this mysterious operation can be best followed step
by step. Thus a circular sunspot may be seen gradually
undergoing the process of deformation, then breaking up
into parts, and ending by giving birth to other spots,
which precede the original one in a row and at some dis-
tance, proceeding at the same pace and reproducing on a

Sir Charles Lyell expressed a strong desire that Kent's Cavern
should also be systematically and thoroughly explored; and it
was with his full concurrence that the proposal to do so was laid
before the Committee of the Geological Section of the British
Association at Bath in 1864, the day after he delivered his
Presidential Address, whilst his ardent advocacy, together with
that of the late Prof. Phillips, secured its ready acceptance by the
Committee of Recommendations and the General Committee.
At the first meeting of the Cavern Committee, appointed in the
year just mentioned, he was unanimously elected chairman, and
he continued to occupy that post until his lamented decease on
Feb. 27, 1875. Though the state of his health prevented him
from taking any active part in the exploration, his interest in
the work never abated ; he always carefully studied the Monthly
Reports of Progress sentjiim by the superintendents, and he
made careful arrangements for their preservation.
The Tenth Report, read to the Geological Section of the
Association at the Belfast meeting, and printed in the'annual
volume for last year, brought up the work to the end of July
1874. The exploration has been carried on without interruption
from that datetothe present time; the mode of excavation adopted
at the beginning has been uniformly followed; the superinten-
dents have visited the cavern daily; the progress of the work has
been carefully recorded in the cavern diary ; the workmen have,
as heretofore, given complete satisfaction ; and Monthly Reports
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
have been regularly sent to Sir Charles Lyell until his decease,
and subsequently to Mr. John Evans.
The cavern continues to be much visited by persons desirous
of studying on the spot its characters and phenomena; and
during the last twelve months the superintendents have had the
pleasure of taking a large number of visitors through those
branches which have been explored, and of explaining to them
the mode of operation. Probably a still larger number have
been conducted by the "guide," who, though under the control
of the committee, is not permitted to take parties to those
branches of the cavern in which the exploration is in progress,
or has not been begun.
As in former years, rats have frequently been seen running
about in various parts of the cavern, including those in which
the men have been at work, though hundreds of feet from any
glimmering of daylight; and they have displayed their usual
boldness as well as their skill in carrying off candles. In other
branches, almost as far from the entrances, where all researches
have ceased (or some years, their footprints are to be seen in
great numbers, especially on the silt left, here and there, where
the drip is copious in wet weather.

The Cave of Inscriptions.—The chamber in which the Long
Arcade terminates has been called "The Cave of Inscriptions,"
from the number of n?mes, initials, and dates graved on the
stalagmite in various parts of it. Besides those on the "In-
scribed Boss of Stalagmite" at the entrance of the cave, de-

scribed in the Tenth Report, inscriptions occur on what is known
as the "Hedges Boss " and on the walls of the chamber. There
are also a large number of names, &c, smoked on various parts of
theioof, as there are, indeed, in almost every branch of the
cavern, some of which appear to be of very considerable
antiquity. The oldest ol the inscribed dates is 1609, and the
most modern 1792, but the most conspicuous and most famous
ot the inscriptions is "Robert Hedges, of Ireland, Feb. 20,
1688."
It was stated in the Tenth Report that the exploration of this
cave had been completed up to sixteen feet from its entrance,
when it was suspended in order to proceed with Clinnick's
Gallery; that the Granular, or less ancient, Stalagmilic Floor was
found to be everywhere intact and continuous, and that the Crys-
talline, or moic ancient, Stalagmite lay beneath it; that the
latter had been broken by some natural agency, and though in
some cases the severed portions remained in situ, in others they
had been removed and were not always traceable; that adjacent
to the left wall of the cave a wedge-like layer of cave earth lay
in its proper place between the stalagmites, and was six inches
thick at the wall, but thinned out about a yard from it, beyond
which the one floor lay immediately on the other. On resuming
the exploration of the cave it was found that the state of the
deposits continued to be the same up to thirty-four feet from the
entrance, with the single exception that the broken blocks of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
crystalline stalagmite were never dislodged beyond being faulted
to the extent of two or three inches. At and beyond the point
just specified, traces of the earlier explorers were again met with
in almost every pait of the cave, but were found to be limited to
the breaking up of the stalagmites and the subjacent deposit to
the depth of twelve inches at most. A thin layer of typical
cave earth extended throughout the entire chamber, and it was
obvious that at the time when the deposition of the cave earth
commenced the crystalline stalagmite did not exist as a con-
tinuous sheet, for in considerable spaces the cave-earth lay
immediately on the breccia without any stalagmite between them,
and it was not always easy to determine the exact junction of the
two deposits. On the discovery of objects of interest at or near
this doubtful junction, care was taken to record them as
belonging to the "cave earth and breccia," even though, from
their own characters, it was usually easy to refer them to then-
proper deposits and eras respectively.
The Cave of Inscriptions was found to extend upwards of
sixty feet from north-east to south-west, forty-five feet from south-
east to north-west, and to be upwards of twenty feet high.

pected to lead to a new external entrance to the cavern. It
extends in a north-westerly diiection for fully sixty feet, and is
of sufficient width for a man to pass easily ; beyond this its extent

floor is a thick sheet of the crystalline or more ancient stalagmite,
and is abruptly truncated at the junction of the Recess with the
Cave of Inscriptions. It rested on a thick mechanical accumu-
lation, which is unmistakeable breccia, and reaches a higher
level than elsewhere in the cavern, so far as is at present known.
It was decided to leave intact the Stalagmitic Floor, and in fact
to buuow under it; but when the excavation had reached a

nearly together as to render it necessary to abandon the work, or
to break up the floor and proceed at a higher lcveL The former
course was, though reluctantly, decided on. The only specimens
found here were two teeth of bear, a few bones, and an unim-
portant piece of lliut.
The Alcove.—A recess in the eastern wall of the Cave of
Inscriptions, near the Hedges Boss, and which received the
name of the "Alcove," was next explored. When emptied it
proved to be scarcely lofty enough for a man to stand erect,
and ten feet in length and breadth, but divided into two compart-
ments by a limestone partition extending nearly across it. Its
exploration, which occupied three weeks, was rewarded with
thirty-nine "finds " of remains of mammals, including fifty-nine
teeth of bear, several of them in portions of jaws; sixteen of
fox, all of them in portions of three lower jaws ; four of hyajna;
numerous bones, including several good specimens, though all
of them more or less fragmentary; and one coprolite. The
teeth of hya-na, two of the jaws of fox, and the coprolite were
met with in cave earth ; but the remainingjaw of fox (No. 6,619)
was found in the breccia. It was broken into two pieces, which
were lying together and contained five teeth, and is the only
known relic ot the genus in this old deposit. The Alcove con-
tained no trace of Hint or chert.

opening out of the south-western corner of the Cave of Inscrip-
tions has been termed the "Great Oven." Its exploration was
begun July 27, 1875, or but four days before the period at which
this report closes. It contains a thin layer of cave earth, and a
deposit of breccia of unknown depth. The former has already
yielded a few traces of hyxna, and the latter a greater number of
ursine remains.
On studying the osseous remains found in the Breccia in the
branches of the cavern explored during the last twelve months,
the following prominent facts arrest attention :—Some of the
teeth of bear are those of very old animals and worn almost
to the fang. The jaws, though frequently broken, have never
lost their lower borders, as is almost unilormly the case with the
cave-earth specimens; and none of the bones appear to have
been gnawed. In no instance were the bones found lying in
their anatomical relations, but different parts of the skeleton were
often huddled confusedly together; thus, in No. 6,613, found in
the Alcove, a canine tooth adheres to one side of the proximal
end of a tibia, and a piece of jaw to another side. Some of the
specimens have fretted surfaces, and appear to have been rolled
by running water. Many of the bones were broken where they

an essay on the structure and systematic position of the Acineta:.
The author identifies his species with one figured, but not deter-
mined, by the late Mr. Alder in the "Annals of Natural History"
for 1851, p. 426. Its nucleus is remarkable for having a number
of irregular stellate branches, and its tentacles are differentiated
into captorial and suctorial. After a review of the structure of
Acineta: generally, Dr. Hertwig comes to the conclusion that a
unicellular organism, covered with cilia, is the original form from
which Acineta; and Infusorians have sprung, but that it cannot
yet be determined whether it possessed a cytostome, and thus
was a true ciliated Infusorian, or whether it was provided with
tentacles, and was intermediate between Ciliata and Acineta:.—
The whole of the remainder (114 pages) of this part is occupied
by a veiy notable paper by Dr. Emil Rosenberg, on the develop-
ment of the vertebral column and of the os centrale carpi of
man. He sets before himself the problem, little touched
hitherto, of the discovery of the steps by which man may have
developed from the nearest mammalian stock. Taking first the
vertebral column, he sets forth the differences existing therein in
the various Anthropomorpbre, and seeks to reconcile them with
that of man. For instance, in two genera, Troglodytes and
Hylobates, there are thirteen dorsal vertebra;, while intheOrang
and in man there are only twelve. But Dr. Rosenberg has dis-
covered in more than one human embryo an actual rib-rudiment
on the 13th dorsal vertebra ; so that the homology of the 13th
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
dorsal in man and Troglodytes is established. Another result
that Dr. Rosenberg claims to have demonstrated from examina-
tion of human embryos is that a process of transformation goes on
In the growth of the sacrum, by which vertebra; at the proximal
end, with their costal elements, are assumed into the sacrum,
while a corresponding number at the distal end undergo reduc-
tion and are dismisssd into the caudal region. And this process,
generalised, may be applied to each of the hinder regions of the
vertebral columns. Thus in the history of development each
lumbar vertebra in man is the result of a single transformation
from the condition of a dorsal vertebra ; each sacral vertebra has
previously passed through the lumbar stage; while the caudal
vertebra; have been successively dorsal, lumbar, and sacral,
before becoming caudal. This is necessarily but a very imper-
fect sketch of the major subject of this paper, which is of very
high interest.

SEVENTH REPORT OF THE SCIENCE
COMMISSION
^^HE present Report deals with the University of
London, the Universities of Sco'.land, the Uni-
versity of Dublin and Trinity College, and the Queen's
University in Ireland. With regard to the University of
London the Commission has few suggestions to make,
though it is of opinion that the Matriculation Exami-
nation would have a still higher value than it has
if a Practical Examination could be instituted in connec-
tion therewith. "The enforcement of a practical test
would accelerate the introduction of practical work into
school teaching, and would thus exert a very favourable
influence on the Progress of Scientific Education."
The Commission is also of opinion that the University
of London should follow the example of the University of
Edinburgh, and award the degree of D.Sc. only to those
who have given proofs of the desire and capacity to make
some addition to scientific knowledge.
The greater portion of this Report refers to the Univer-
sities of Scotland. The Report begins by referring to the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
inquiry conducted by the Commissioners appointed under
the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1858, and to the
reforms instituted by them. The recommendations made
by this Commission were, however, controlled by the fact
that the sum to be provided by Parliament to carry them
out would not exceed io,oco/. a year. The Universities
Commission kept very much, therefore, to the old lines,
making classical learning the foundation of a University
course, and prescribing for graduation in arts, a course
extending over four winter sessions, and including
"attendance on the Classes of Humanity, Greek, Mathe-
matics, Logic, Moral Philosophy, and Natural Philo-
sophy :" and, in addition to these, "attendance on a
course of English Literature," which previously had not
been required in any Scottish University except that of
Edinburgh.
The Commission observes with satisfaction that in the
Scotch Graduation Examination it is clearly recognised
that a fair training both in literature and in science is the
best basis for further advances in either the one direction
or the other. They suggest, however, that the student
should be allowed to show the required proficiency,
whether in science or literature, by passing an examina-
tion at such a period in his University career as will
enable him, in the latter part of his academical course, to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
devote his attention systematically to a particular group
of subjects.
In referring to the examinations for the degrees of
Bachelor and Doctor of Science, the Report states that
recently a regulation has been made at Edinburgh that
each candidate for the degTee of D.Sc. must submit a thesis
containing " some original researches on the subject of
his intended examination, and such thesis must be
approved before the candidate is allowed to proceed in
his examination." It seems quite astonishing that this,
which has for generations been the rule on the Continent,
has not been done in all our Universities long ago. De-
grees of an essentially similar kind have been instituted
in Glasgow.
Vol. xiii.—No. 315 j
The most important part of the Report on the Scottish
Universities is concerned with the deficiencies in respect
to assistants and apparatus. In some cases the rooms
are not at all adapted to the kind of teaching that must
be carried on in them. The laboratory accommodation
is throughout glaringly deficient, and ill-adapted for

[Nov. ii, 1875
NATURE
In the Dublin University there are thirty-three fellow-
ships, which are tenable for life, irrespective of the restric-
tion of celibacy, and are now open to all without
distinction of creed. The Commissioners think that it
would be very desirable that in the election to Fellow-
ships important original research should be regarded as
a substantial element of merit.
The nature of the constitution of the Queen's University
Ireland, and its three colleges at Belfast, Cork, and Gal way,
is well known. The education to be obtained at these
colleges is fairly complete, both on the scientific and
literary side, and the examinations imposed by the Uni-
versity are such as to make its degrees of real value.
The evidence shows that the appliances for teaching
are in some respects insufficient, and that there is a serious
deficiency of funds for maintaining the efficiency of the
Queen's Colleges in this respect. The Report concludes
and recommends as follows with regard to the Queen's
University in Ireland :—
"In founding the Queen's Colleges, the State did not
adopt the principle of assisting and stimulating local

efforts, and if we except the exhibitions and prizes, to
which reference has been already made, as having been
provided by public subscription, and a few other exhibi-
tions which have been founded at Belfast, no voluntary
contributions have been received by them. They are
institutions for which the State has made itself respon-
sible, and in which, as part of a University system, a
complete scientific training is implied.
"As we think it ot great importance that the sanc-
tion of the State should not be given to the teaching of
science on a scale inadequate to ensure its efficiency, we
recommend (1) That an increased annual grant be made to
the Queen's Colleges for the purpose of providing assis-
tants, apparatus, and the other necessary appliances of
practical scientific teaching. We further recommend (2)
that the Professorship of Natural History in the Queen's
College, Belfast, be separated from that of Geology and
M ineralogy."
The general conclusion reached, then, in this Seventh
Report is that it would take very little to make London
University nearly perfect as an examining and degree-
granting body; that Dublin University is in a healthy
condition, and by a little amendment in the subjects of
examination for her Scholarships and Fellowships, she
might be an example to her sister Universities in Eng-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
land ; that the Queen's University, Ireland, and the four
Scottish Universities are all working in the right lines!
and that what they mainly require in order that they may
develop into perfectly efficient teaching bodies, so far as
science is concerned, are funds to provide the necessary
men, buildings, and apparatus. No doubt the recom-
mendations of the Commissioners in reference to these
and other matters will receive serious attention in the
proper quarter.

that "all those vessels which carry blood to a capillary
system are called arteries j" that in "scaly amphibia "—
by which we assume reptiles are meant—the two ventricles
always communicate, which is not true as far as the cro-
codiles and alligators are concerned ; and that the heart of
a warm-blooded animal, removed from the body, will
continue to beat " so long as a supply of oxygenated blood
is provided."
The term "secretion" in its widest sense is said to
denote "all those processes in which substances quit the
blood in an altered or unaltered condition." This involves
the inclusion of that simple nutritive diffusion into tissues
which results in the origin and growth of bone, cartilage,
&c.; an unnecessary complication, we cannot help think-
ing, and one apt to mislead. When it is stated that
"nothing is known about the formation and regeneration
of bone-tissue, except the morphological appearances
presented in the various stages," justice is not done to Dr.
Heale's most ingenious and highly probable explanation of
the process by which it comes into existence.

The second portion of the work discusses the energetic
relations of the body. Parts give indications of having
been evolved from the author's inner consciousness, when
he might have appealed to sound fact. On the whole we
prefer the way in which the subject is treated in Dr.
Pavy's excellent work on "Food." Prof. Hermann's
theory of muscular contractility, based entirely on
slender analogies, does not impress itself on our atten-
tion more than does the not less satisfactory one of Dr.
Radcliffe.
The "liberating" or " discharging " apparatus, in other
words the nervous system, occupies the third section of
the work. As our knowledge of the nerves is very super-
ficial, remarks the author, it must suffice to establish
empirically the conditions which increase, diminish, or
destroy irritability. This is done in a most exhaustive
and excellent manner. Prof. Hermann regards the
phenomenon of clectrotonus as an effect of contact, the
contents of nerve-tubes which are dying or in activity
being negative to the contents of nerve-tubes which are
living and at rest. The chapters on special sense will
be read with particular interest, from the masterly manner
in which they are written. Why so much space is
devoted to the horopter, a surface the physical relations
of which are as much connected with stereoscopic photo-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
graph cameras and double magic lanterns as with eyes,
we do not know. With regard to the author's ideas on
the recent views promulgated by Hitzig, Fritsch, Noth-
nagel, and Ferrier, we will quote his own words. "The
movements which have recently been induced by elec-
trical stimulation, since they do not occur after mechanical
or chemical stimulation, may very well be set down to
the irritation of more deeply seated regions, for the latter
are unavoidably exposed to the diffusion of currents.
.... No results as to the nature and distribution of the
functions of the cortex, even of the value of approxima-
tions, can be deduced from these experiments."
In the fourth section of the work a short account is
given of the development of the embryo, not detailed
enough to be of much service, except to the initiated.
This rapid glance at the contents of Prof. Hermann's
work indicates that it adopts a method of treatment that
is more modern than most. In perusing it in detail the
incorporation of the results arrived at in all directions by
physiologists during the last twenty years, makes its
value still further apparent. The many conflicting state-

series of sharply outlined and brilliant pictures, the most
prominent and often the most unpleasant features of the
great struggle out of which it is evident the white race
must come victorious.
The regions with which the work is mainly concerned
are the Pacific States, especially California, and also
the States on the Gulf. In the West, especially, the fight
is a regular melee between white men, red men, black
men, and yellow men. Very striking indeed is Mr.
Dixon's account of the means by which the Chinese are
rapidly asserting for themselves a place of the first im-
portance in and around San Francisco,'notwithstanding the
disgusting and degrading habits of the majority of them-
When the heat of the struggle is over, when the country
is again sufficiently populated, and the people have settled
down to a life of steady progress, what will be their cha-
racteristics, physical, intellectual, and moral? It is an
interesting question, an intricate problem, which we fear
it would be difficult to work out beforehand. In a recent
number we referred to the valuable paper by Prof. Wilson,
of Toronto, detailing his observations on the relations
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
between the whites and the Indians, especially in Canada.
His conclusion is, that in accounting for the disappear-
ance of the American Indian, too much prominence has
been given to extermination and too little to absorption.
He produces data to show that a very considerable
amount of red blood has been absorbed by the white
intruders, and that aboriginal traces are to be found
widespread among all classes of society. Moreover, that
it is difficult to find a pure Indian, and that the half-
breeds who now mainly represent the old proprietors of
•he soil have excellent stuff in them, and arc being con-
strained gradually to settle down to a civilised life. The
conclusion is, that in the end a homogeneous race will
result, having no doubt large white characteristics, but at
the same time showing unmistakeable marks of a red
ancestry.
Where one race intrudes itself forcibly into a country
already populated, and has to fight its way to find a place
for itself, this mixture is inevitable; the men who do
this rough work cannot as a rule take their own
women with them. Some of the most impressive
pictures in Mr. Dixon's work are connected with this
subject, and show how inevitable it is that under the
circumstances alluded to, a large half-breed population
must arise. We are sorry to see, however, that Mr. Dixon
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
does not speak so well of the half-breeds as Prof. Wilson
does, though this may arise from the fact that those of
Canada have as a rule more white blood than red in their
veins. In the end, which approaches with accelerating
speed, when homogeneity is attained, the United States
will be populated by a race of very mixed blood indeed,
though it is evident to everyone but a pessimist, that the
brain and sinew and muscle which dominate in the
Old World will, both in quality and quantity, in intension
and extension, to use logical terms, bear the sway on the
other side of the water. The great stumbling-block in
this, as in other respects, in America, is the Negro, the
"culled gemm'n," as he now calls himself. Extermi-
nation does not appear likely to be his fate, and "ab-
sorption " in his case seems a mighty long way off.
Two of the most interesting chapters in Mr. Dixon's
works refer to education in America, and will somewhat
surprise those who fancy that America has a system of
education as thorough and uncompromising as that of
Germany. While Mr. Dixon has evidently presented here
almost exclusivcly'the dark side of the education question

rent kinds, and it is necessary carefully to distinguish
between them. Thus certain periodic movements occur
only during the growth of the part, and cease entirely
when the structure has become full-grown; and the term
<; nutation" is restricted by Pfeffer to these recurrent
movements during growth. In other cases periodic move-
ments occur which are not determined by the growth of the
part, but are due exclusively to the elongation and contrac-
tion of certain portions of tissue; and these latter are called
by Pfeffer " movements of variation." These movements
of variation which occur so commonly in the Leguminosse
are due to the action of more or less joint or hinge-
like portions of the leaf. Nutations on the other hand
which occur in very many leaves or petioles are due to
unequal growth of the tissues, and not to the presence of
a joint. As the movements of nutation are dependent on
the growth of the part, they cease when growth ceases;
and as the zone of maximum growth of the part changes
its position, so also the seat of the nutation will vary.
The movements of variation have a very different cha-
racter, as they continue when the leaf is full-grown, and
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
naturally, as they depend on a definite structure having a
fixed position, they do not change their place during
growth. The two forms of movement are very closely
related, and jointed parts during growth often exhibit
movements of nutation, thus showing the close relation-
ship that exists between the two.
Periodic movements, whether movements of nutation
or of variation, are either entirely independent of external
stimuli, or are conditioned by them. The former class
are the " autonomous " or " spontaneous " movements, the
latter are the "paratonic" or "induced " movements—
"Receptionsbewegun^en," and depend on the paratonic
action of external agents, as, for example, light and heat.
As a consequence of the paratonic action, the leaf makes,
in addition to the simple to-and-fro pendulum-like move-
ment, certain further oscillations with decreasing ampli-
tude, which Pfeffer calls "Nachwirkungsbewegungen," but
which for want of any better word we may call simply
secondary movements. It is by the help of these " secon-
dary " movements that Pfefter explains the peculiarities of
the daily periodic movements of plants. The first chapter
of the work now before us is devoted to these general
remarks on the movements.
The second chapter treats of the mechanism of the
induced movements evoked by alternation in illumina-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tion, the so-called sleeping and waking of plants. These
movements are either movements of variation, as in the
Phastolus vulgaris, or they are movements of nutation,
as seen in the leaves of Impatient noli-mc-tangere and the
flowers of Leontodon hastilis. The measurements of the
movements are made by an instrument described and
figured by Pfeffer as the Lever Dynamometer.
The third chapter treats of the daily periodic move-
ments. The subsequent chapters treat of such subjects
as the mechanism of the daily movements, the intensity
and internal causes of the movements, the influence of
temperature and gravity, autonomous movements, and the
like. A short chapter is devoted to the distribution of
periodic movements. From it we learn that movements
of variation are common in plants belonging to the Legu-
minosrc and Oxnlidacere. All the plants of an order do not
necessarily show movements of variation. Thus in the
Euphorbiaceas they occur in Phyllanthus; while in Eu-
phorbia we have movements of nutation. A short his-
torical review and resume of results concludes this most
interesting volume. W. R. M'Nab.

Bees and Clover
IN Nature, vol. xii. p. 527, it is stated that two nests of
En-dish humble-bees have been sent out to New Zealand, and
tliat they are specially desired there for the purpose of fertilising
the common clover. I suppose the red clover is meant, as the
white is fertilised by the hive-bee, and the wonderful rapidity
with which it has spread over the Australian colonies proves
that it does not require any further assistance.
The species of Bombus sent out is not mentioned in the para-
graph and it is not likely that Mr. Frank Buckland would send
the wrong one; but it is worth pointing out, as not being gene-
rally known, that the commonest of the humble-bees (Bombus

flowers. 1 have for several years watched the humble-bees, and
I never saw this species go to the mouth of the corolla of the red
clover As far as my experience goes, it invariably bites a hole
at the base of the flower and extracts the nectar from that open-
ing «o that it is of no use in carrying the pollen from one flower
to another. All the other species of humble-bees that I have
noticed go to the mouth of the flowers, and they alone are useful
in their fertilisation. ,
The common scarlet-runner or pole-bean is entirely dependent
on the visits of bees for the fertilisation of its flowers, and I have

lately seen an instance where the attentions of Bombus terrestris
were mischievous and hurtful. A friend of mine, living near
Finchley, had a late sowing of scarlet-runners rendered barren
by their operations. The smaller humble-bees did not visit Ins
garden, and Bombus terrestris cut holes at the base of both the
expanded flowers and the unopened buds. The hive-bee with
some trouble, by pushing between the petals, can get at the
nectar and sometimes fertilises the flowers, but as soon as the
humble-bee commences to cut holes at the base it seeks for these
perforations as a readier means of access.
At the beginning of the season some of the Bombus terrestris
will be seen°visiting the flowers of the scarlet-runner in a legiti-
mate manner, but they soon learn that it is easier for them to
Fet at the nectary by cutting holes at the base, and later on their
acnuired experience teaches them to attack the buds in the same
manner. Large gaping flowers such as the Nasturtium and the
Fox-glove are fertilised by this species, but to most of the narrow
tubular ones its visits are injurious.
I hope therefore that it is not Bombus terrestris (the common
large yellow-banded kind) but some other species of the genus
that has been sent to New Zealand, and if so it will be a most

Curious Australian Implement
In Nature, vol. xil p. 544, a correspondent points out the
resemblance existing between an implement used by the Ute
Indians and one belonging to the Australian natives, which he
calls a vermin hook. May I venture to suggest that he may
possibly have mistaken the use of the latter? It appears to me
to be identical with the instrument used by all the Australian
"river " blacks to throw their light reed spears with, which con-
sist of a heavy miall wood point and a shaft of reed. The bone
hook is inserted in the head of the reed, the spear resting
between the forefinger and thumb of the hand that holds the
thrower and lying parallel to it, thus :—
the spear being propelled from the hooked end of the thrower,
which is rapidly brought forward into a vertical position, thus pro-
pelling the spear before it. During several years on the different
Australian rivers, I saw the weapon universally used as above,
but neither there nor elsewhere in the colonies for any other
purpose. J. P. Glover

The first heliocentric minimum in 1876, with the epoch
and period of Schonfeld's second catalogue of variable
stars (1875), occurs on January 2, at 5I1. 34-5m. G.M.T.,
or January 2^23226 ; the minima throughout the year will
be obtained by the successive addition of 2d 86729. For
times of geocentric minima, corrections must be applied
to the times so calculated, which may be found from
Corr. to heliocentric minimum = 767m. R. sin. (S + 3S°69),
where R is the earth's radius-vector at the date, and S
the sun's longitude.
The period of Algol, which had diminished since 1782,
at first slowly, but afterwards more rapidly, after remaining
constant or nearly so for a time, appears to be again
slowly diminishing.
According to Schmidt, of Athens, the brightness of
Algol is equal to that of b Persei about 47 minutes before
and after minimum, to that of 1 Persei about 62 minutes
before and after the same, and to that of (3 Trianguli 95

minutes before and after. The fluctuations extend over
about 9^ hours.
There is a suspicion of variability about the light of the
small companion of this star, first remarked by Schroeter.
Smyth measured it in 1835. During the last two years it
has sometimes been readily visible and at others dis-
cernible with difficulty with the same instrument ; but a
systematic course of observations is required to decide if
there be a real variation.
According to Schonfeld, S Cancri will be at a minimum
on Nov. 14 at i6h. 50m., Dec. 3 at i6h. 3m., and Dec. 22
at I5h. 17m. G.M.T.
For U Geminorum it appears very difficult to make a
prediction likely to be of any service, so that very frequent
examination is necessary for the determination of the
times of maximum. Mr. Otto Strove states that this
object does not usually disappear in the Pulkova refractor.
Schonfeld thinks the period varies between 70 and 150
days. A secondary minimum has been remarked on
several occasions about the time of greatest light. In
most periods the star has not continued visible in ordinary

three letters, with which we have been favoured.
"The Circle Squared " (in November 1867) has, we guess,
been noticed by Prof. De Morgan. There is a nicely drawn
diagram, two concentric circles, two squares, said to be
their respective equivalents, all in black; an equilateral
tTiangle and its circumscribing circle in red ink; the
former is described on a side of the smaller square, and
the red circle passes through the extremities of the same
side. A statement is made, which appears to be a state-
ment and nothing more, for it proves nothing. From
"Squaring the Circle" (April 15, 1874) we learn that the
writer has leisure (fons et origo malif), and so has ven-
tured to amuse himself by considering the relation of the
equilateral triangle, the square, and the circle. He
obtains the positive altitude of an equilateral triangle on
a side of the square to be 775448559771 H25,and requires
the exact side of the square and the proportion of the
triangle to the square and the equivalent circle. He
winds up, like many of his race, with the following reflec-
tions :—" I think if the learned in geometry, mathematics,
and trigonometry, abandoned approximating theories, and
would take the trouble to elucidate the above-stated pro-
positions, they would undoubtedly be able to subvert all
anomalous and vague theorems, free the study of geo-
metry, &c, from ambiguity, enable tutors to explain

correctly, remove burthens imposed en the mind of the
pupil, and establish a system of teaching which shall be
correct and intelligible, for it is evident the result of
minute calculations proves there is no mystery in geo-
metry, mathematics, or trigonometry; they are uniform,
and may be more easily taught and comprehended with
perfect truthfulness without approximation." To prevent
trouble, this man of leisure appends the rule; it is: Add
one-seventh to the altitude, and we get the base; and so
on. Not satisfied with the above remarks, we have a note
to the "learned" (see above) : and it is the following
curious sentence:—"It is worthy of remark, and more
especially to those who are interested in the forthcoming
'Transit of Venus,' when the true distance of the earth
from the sun is to be determined, and a difference of
about three millions of miles accounted for, to be in a
position to prove the fact. Now all this can be accom-
plished by anxious, minute observation and correct calcu-

cither of these paradoxers. The former has gained notice
in the Budget (we are sorry to record the recent death of
another able opponent of these views, Mr. T. T. Wilkin-
son, F.R.A.S.) ; the latter has figured before the public in
the daily papers. A consequence of Mr. Wallace's accept-
ance of Mr. Hampden's wager is that the former gentle-
man has for nearly five years been the subject of con-
tinuous libels (see letters in Daily News, March 11, also
March 9). It is to be hoped that an enforced retirement
of a twelvemonth will result in Mr. Hampden's learning

In De Morgan's account of Taylor the Platonist (/? of
P. pp. 182, &c.) there is nothing said of an early work
of his, "The Elements of a new method of Reasoning in
Geometry applied to the rectification of the Circle" (1780),
"a juvenile performance lost or suppressed" (biographer

The malady {Mains cyclometricus) is not confined to the
Old World; our concluding instances will be drawn from a
Geometry published at New York, and from a treatise
specially devoted to the subject and printed at Montreal.
We have not a copy of Mr. Lawrence S. Benson's "The
Elements of Euclid and Legendre, with Elements of
Plane and Spherical Trigonometry,* but he has sent us
"A Reply to Criticisms on Benson's Geometry." This
will answer our purpose better, for the defence shows
that the malady is confirmed. The symptoms are even
more exaggerated than in Mr. J. Smith's case, for whereas
his circumference ("Budget," p. 318) shrank into exactly
3J times his diameter, Mr. Benson's has shrunk to only
3 times! Where all this will end if the malady increases
it is hard to say; perhaps the unfortunate circle will
shrink up into its own centre! Opponents had pointed
out " that when the areas of polygons inscribed in the
circle are computed by means of plane triangles, a result
is obtained for the inscribed polygons greater than 3R2,"
and they reasoned (it seems to us irresistibly) "that it is
impossible for a circle to be less than a figure inscribed
in the circle." Mr. Benson trusts, however, that after
fourteen years' application to mathematics he will not be
thought to have committed so egregious a blunder as to
bring himself into direct contradiction of the self-evident
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
proposition, "A part is less than the whole." He com-
mences his defence with the statement that Torelli con-
tends that the circle will be proved to be the square on
its diameter exactly as 3 to 4. He then goes on to instance
that Playfair (" Euclid," p. 307) demonstrates that Torelli's
proposition is true on two conditions. Is it credible that
Mr. Benson should proceed to say: "The fact that the
preposition is true 'on two conditions' prevents the pro-
position from being false, for a false proposition can be
tme on no condition." The conclusion of the whole
matter is that he replies to the inquiry, " How is it that
reasoning from plane triangles for the computation of the
areas of polygons, and reasoning from the ratios of rect-
angles, when they are all rectilinear magnitudes, that
different and conflicting results are obtained?" that " the
reasoning on the ratios and rotation of surfaces involves
their relation to each other; whereas the computation of
the plane triangles involves their boundaries: and since
for the quadrature of THE CIRCLE the relation between
the circle and a certain rectangular space is required, it is
evident that the proper mode of reasoning is by means

assumption, and we also ask him how he gets the last
line on p. 27. These crucial points occur in "inde-
pendent proofs" of the same theorem; they are pure
"beggings of the question," we believe. This is all we
have to say on Part I. Part II. opens with an admirable
motto (reminding us herein of Mr. James Smith), " Prove
all things ; hold fast that which is good." Having proved
then the previous theorem, he holds fast to that, and pro-
ceeds to the "construction of the circle ;" his object being
"to make manifest the great importance of the circle as
one of the fundamental facts belonging to the Plan of
Creation." As we consider the foundation wrong, until
Prop. A is proved, we shall not follow the writer through
the twenty-four pages of rather obscure mathematics
devoted to this subject. We come next to " Mathematics
and the Art of Computation." Starting from what he has
(as he thinks, we will say) just proved, viz., that "the
difference of the quadrant and the chord of the quadrant
is an aliquot part of the quadrant and of the chord, and
that the number of those equal parts contained in the
chord being nine-the quadrant contains ten": because he

finds in this "conclusive evidence that the (so-called)
Arabic system of notation is is not an artificial human
contrivance, but a great natural fact of a primary cha-
racter, a fundamental part of the Science of Creation."
Further down he speaks of many persons preferring
"with a strange, and, as it would seem, with an increasing
perversity, to cultivate the thorns and thistles, leaving
t he good seed as not worth utilising." He is then careful
to state that by "thorns and thistles" he does not mean
the modern methods of mathematical analysis. Still, " is
it, or is it not, true that the language of mathematics is
last becoming an unknown tongue to ordinarily educated
men, and that those to whom it is known can scarcely
hold converse with their fellows (on any scientific sub-
ject) in ordinary language without a feeling of conde-
scension, and scarcely without a feeling of impropriety?
.... Is it true that the mathematician does now, in
some degree, regard his fellow-worker who is unprac-
tised in the calculus and non-conversant with differ-
ential methods as but little better than a publican
and heathen?" We will not undertake to answer
this question, but perhaps our author's ground for this
opinion is the reputed division of the human species by
the "Cambridge Wrangler" into those who understand
the differential calculus and those who do not. He him-

self goes on to say, " If it be true that such a result does
manifest itself in any considerable degree, it may be pro-
nounced decidedly unwholesome and bad—bad for science
and bad for civilisation—because mathematical know-
ledge is a necessity to science and a necessity to civilisa-
tion." This we admit. He then reiterates the statement
that he knows that examination will show his demonstra-
tion of the quantitive {sic) ratio of the perimeters of the
circle to the diameters is "mathematically incontestable."
He then goes into an examination of Prop. XIII., Book V.,
of Brewster's Legendre: "The surface of a regular in-
scribed polygon and that of a similar polygon circum-
scribed, being given, to find the surface of the regular
inscribed and circumscribed polygons having double the
number of sides." Among other objections, he objects to
the italicised statement (Prop. XIV., " Legendre"), " We
shall infer that the last result expresses the area of the
circle, which, since it must always lie between the inscribed
and circumscribed polygon, and since these polygons
agree as far as a certain place of decimals, must also
agree with both as far as the same place." His objection

then, too, the joint processes are wanting, &c. On the
other hand, Geotrilon is distinguished in the most
peculiar way, by one organ, from all other Amphibia, viz.,
by the tongue. This is a pedicelled disc, like a mush-
room, on the bottom of the mouth cavity, where it is con-
nected with the tongue-bone apparatus ; the latter, how-
ever, does not merely consist of the same parts as in
other Amphibia, but at its two hinder ends there is
attached on either side a long thin cartilage, which
reaches, free between the neck muscles and the skin, as
far as the back, and is enclosed in an envelope of special
muscles, which are only attached at its hinder end and in
front to the rest of the tongue-bone. If, now, this muscle
be contracted, it thrusts out the cartilage rod, and with it
the tongue, in a way similar to that observed in Chime-
leons, Woodpeckers, and Ant-eaters. Compare the annexed
drawing. Thus Nature connects in the most remarkable
manner a complicated organ of the higher Vertebrates
with the organisation of amphibians that evidently stand
very low.

Chambon.
It is with the southern valley, or that of the source of
the Dordogne river, that we are concerned, the head of
which occupies a noble amphitheatre facing the south,
immediately under the highest summit of Mont Dore.
My companion and myself were on our way to the sum-

about seven miles to the westward; we were skirting the
rocky and very steep sides of the amphitheatre at an ele-

theatre so strongly inclined mc to the latter view, that I
determined on visiting them before leaving the neighbour-
hood. Accordingly, on the following day, I took the high
road to Latour, south-eastward to the village of Chastail.
Then leaving the road, I descended and crossed a small
stream to the eastward. The ascent of its steep opposite
bank led through beechwoods to a broad fiat ridge with
some cheese-makers' huts upon it, from which, still pro-
ceeding eastward, I descended by a gentle slope imme-
diately upon the floor of the valley, and found myself
.amongst a group of magnificent boulders that had evi-
dently been deposited by an ancient glacier which had
flowed from the rocky amphitheatre at the head of the
valley.
The blocks were of trachyte, and what I took to be
domite, of the same nature as the rocks towards the top
of the pic ; they were scattered over an undulating surface,
which I guessed to be about half a mile long by a quarter
of a mile broad, and occupied both the floor and the very
gentle slopes of this part of the valley, up to perhaps
200 feet above the stream. Others were seen further
down^ the valley, which however soon contracted; its
stream, which meandered in the position of the greatest

number of blocks, becoming, beyond it, a torrent. For
about a mile above this there were no blocks; that is,
between my position and the base of the steep cliffs
forming the amphitheatre where the glaciers had de-
scended. The largest blocks were those furthest down the
valley; at least twenty of them appeared to me to be
upwards of as many feet in length, and one of greater
length was also of greater height. Several were split in
two, like blocks that had been fractured by falling through
the crevasse of a glacier. All were weather-worn and
covered with lichens, ling, and grass.
Returning I took a north-westerly direction, ascending
the spur I had crossed in coming, passing close under a
magnificently mountainous mass of basalt to the east of
the Puy de Pouge. Still further eastward and south of
this Puy are meadows where brood mares and foals are
grazed, upon which were a few large blocks of trachyte or
basalt artificially shaped into very odd forms, some like
skittles, others like a truncated cone with the earth heaped
up round its base ; they may be worthy of further investi-

menced to hold separate meetings: the geologists, the
astronomers, the societies for the improvement of public
health, for ophthalmotology, psychiatrics, and surgery, hold
separate annual meetings independent of the Association

events that have lately taken place in Austria seem to
have deterred German members of the Association from
visiting the Austrian Empire. It will be remembered that
some of the most prominent German professors of the
University of Praghave been all but forced to leave their

This, of course, is a merely fortuitous resemblance.
But many other points indicate that the British Associa-
tion has been modelled from the German pattern. Both
Associations are convened for the same number of days;
both hold the same number of general and sectional
meetings ; they resemble each other in the nature of the
recreations offered to visitors: excursions, dinners, con-
certs, to which in Germany (and Austria) are added balls
and theatrical performances, while England has the
private hospitality of its nobles and rich manufacturers
and merchants to offer, which do not enter into the
German programme or certainly do not appear in it to the
same extent. A festivity of a peculiar character in addi-
tion to those named was offered by the municipality of
Gratz: an illumination by bonfires of the mountains
surrounding the town, a sight of most impressive beauty.
Generally speaking there are no evening meetings in
Germany, and the festivals being of a public nature (not.
depending upon private hospitality), the connection

labours. I will conclude by announcing that the future
participation of Austria in such an enterprise has been
secured by the generosity of a man who has already made
several sacrifices in the interest of Arctic voyages."
The Maecenas of the new expedition alluded to but not

Hans Wilczek.
VVeyprecht's manly speech was followed by great
applause, and has already produced the effect of inducing
the Commission appointed by the German Government

a new expedition, but the establishment of stations of
observation in northern latitudes.
The second general meeting selected Hamburg for its
place of assembly in 1876, and appointed the chief magis-
trate of the town, Burgomaster Kirchenpaucr, and Dr.
Dantzel, to manage affairs. Prof. Behn brought before
the meeting the plan of a society for the assistance of
scientific men in reduced circumstances.
Dr. Giinther then gave a very interesting lecture, to

which, unfortunately, no abridgment could do justice, on
the aims and results of the history of mathematics; fol-
lowed by Prof. Benedict on the history of crime with
regard to ethnology and anthropology. He touched upon
delicate ground, asserting that every action is based less
on liberty than on compulsion; that our acts are
governed by natural laws and not by theological opi-
nions, and that punishment may act as a corrective of
perverted human nature, but is chiefly the outflow of the
desire of society to avenge wrongs inflicted upon it. The
best prevention of crime depends upon the increase of
our knowledge of those circumstances that necessarily
engender it. In England a speech like this would no
doubt have raised a storm of theological indignation.
In Germany the clergy is distinguished by its absence
from scientific meetings. The separation of natural
science and orthodoxy is complete, and no opposition was
therefore offered to these remarks.
In the third and last general meeting two popular
medical lectures were given, one by Dr. Ravoth, on
nursing the sick; the other by Dr. Lender, on ozone (the
latter gentleman having made some doubtful cftorts of
introducing infinitesimally small doses of ozone into
medicine). Then Prof, von Pebal rose, and declaring
the order of the day exhausted, thanked the members

At last Friday's lecture by Dr. Carpenter, in connection with
the St. Thomas Charterhouse School Teachers' Science Associa-
tion, Dr. Lyon Playfair presided. In proposing a vote of thanks to
Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Playfair referred to the subject of compulsory
education, which is gradually becoming universal in this
country, but which, he said, would be pure tyrrany unless the
education in our schools was increased and its quality raised.
Quantity is all very good, but unless there is quality along with
it, there is not much gained. "If it was to be said that children
of thirteen or fourteen years of age were merely to receive the
same education as children of eight years of age, compulsory
education would be but tyranny. Therefore compulsory educa-
tion involved higher education." Dr. Flayfair expressed his
gratification that the teachers composing the Association had
banded themselves together in order to qualify themselves by
attending such lectures as those of the Gilchrist fund and by other
means, to undertake this higher education, which, we believe
with Dr. Playfair, will be forced upon us even in elementary
schools by the spread of compulsory education.

In the Quarterly Return of Marriages, Births, and Deaths,

epidemic of infantile diarrhoea, and the opinion expressed that it
rests with the health officers of the diarrhaa-stricken towns to
discover the nature of the sanitary shortcomings which lead to
this waste of infant life. Perhaps equal stress might have been
laid on a correct knowledge of the modes of nursing infants pre-
vailing in the separate towns as on their merely sanitary condi-
tions, as likely to lead to the tine causes of the observed
variations in the diarrhcea death-rate.

will be likely to result in their extinction. A suggestion has
been made to extend the area of the records to Cellular Crypto-
gams (Vascular Cryptogams being already included). This
might probably be done with advantage as far as Mosses, Lichens,
and Hepaticce, and possibly also Fungi, are concerned ; but with
regard to Algae, it is more doubtful whether much, would be
gained by a lecord of their geographical distribution.

OBSERVATIONS ON DEES, WASPS, AND
ANTS *
""THIS is a continuation of my previous papers on the same
¦*¦ subject. In ihem I recorded various experiments tending
'o show that in many cases Ants and Bees which have found a
store cf feed or of lanae certainly do not communicate the infor-
mation to their friends. This unexpected observation was re-
ceived with so much surprise, and inceed was so unexpected to
myself, that I determined to rereat the experiments: which I
have now done, with, however, the same result. To take one
as an illustration : I placed an F. Fl&va (the small red ant) to a
heap of larvae, which, as is well known, are fleshy legless grubs
incapable of motion. I placed them about two feet from the
entrance to her nest. I then watched her from eleven in the
morning till after seven in the evening, durirg which time she
made eighty six journeys from the nest to the heap of larva:,

carrying one off each time; but although she had so much work
to do, and though the precious larvae were lying for so long
exposed to so many clangers and to ihe weather, she brought no
other ant to assist her in carrying them off. One of the ants I
observed in this way carried otf one by one no less than 187
larva: in a day. In other instances, on the contrary, the opposite
result occurred. I was for some time uncertain, in the latter
cases, whether the ants purposely brought friends to their assist-
ance, or whether, as the ants are sociable insects, it merely hap-
pened that ihe one accompanied the other, as it were, by accident.
To test this question, I took two ants, and placed them under
similar circumstances, the one to a heap of larvae, the other to a
group of two or three, always, however, putting one in place c f
any that was carried off; and it was quite clear that the arts
which were placed to the large group of larva; brought far more
friends to their assistance than those which had apparently only
two or three larvae to move. Of thirty ants which were observed,
those placed to a large number of larva: brought 250 friends,
while those placed to two or three larva: under similar circum-
stances only brought eighty.

a box communicating with the outside by an india-rubber tube

came to this honey continuously for three days, during which
time no other wasp found the honey. As regards colour, I

they are capable of seeing colour, though they appear to be less
influenced by it than are bees.

Irish Hepatic.*:.—S. O. Lindberg has just published a
quarto memoir on the " Hepatica? in Hibernia mense Julii 1873
lectas." This memoir is a reprint from the tenth volume of the
"Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fenniae," and contains a list of
eighty-nine species of Hepatica: collected during a month's visit
to Ireland. The author had the benefit of the great geographical
knowledge of Dr. Moore—the author with A. G. More of the
"Cybele Hibernica "—to enable him to visit, without delay, the
most product.« c ortions of Ireland; otherwise it may be doubted
if his collections would have been so rich. Many of the species
described are v ry rare ; some of them are new. The synonymy
of the species is worked out in a manner worthy of the greatest

praise. Many of the smaller forms among Lejeunea and other
genera are described from fresh specimens or from those preserved
in alcohol. The collections were chiefly made in Killarney. Of
the new species we may mention Lejeunea patens, L. Moorci,
Zy^odon a?is/a/us. In an appendix we find a list of the genera
of European Hepatica: classified as follows :—
1. Marchantiacex.
2. Jungermaniacea,'.
3. Anthocerotea:.
The group of Marchantiacea? is divided into A. Schizocarfie and
B. Clcistocarpt* (this latter includes such genera as Tessellina
and Riccia) ; that of Jungermaniacea; into the same two sub-
sections; and these are again much sub-divided.
The existence in Ireland of so large a number of interesting
forms, of which so very much yet remains to be known as to
their life-history, ought surely to act as a stimulant to the rising
school of Irish botanists.
Marink AlG/E of the United States.—Although nearly

butions to a knowledge of the North American Algae have been

ascribes this to the fact that but few American botanists reside
on the western coast of America, where novelties might be ex-
pected ; and he publishes a most welcome list of the marine

species of the United States proper, not including Alaska, but in
part enumerating those of Vancouver's Island. Those added
since the publication of Harvey's "Nereis" are denoted by a
star. The number of species enumerated is 430, a number that
doubtless will be increased when the Alga: are investigated as
recent lorms either living or preserved in fluid, and not, as is
now frequently the case, only examined when in a state of what
is but little better than that of stains on white paper. Mr. Far-

very large and thick folio, and contains a multiplication table up
to 1000 X 1000, the thousand multiples of any one number being
given on the same page. There is an introduction of seven
pages, in which the use of the tables in multiplying numbers con-

triangles, is explained. Very little information with regard to
the work is to be obtained from the mathematical bibliographers
and historians, Heilbronner, Kastner, Scheibel, Marhard, Rogg,

for the author, but nothing indicates more than that the manu-
script was found in his collection. The book is excessively rare;
a copy sold by auction a few years ago was the only one we ever
saw." While preparing the report of the British Association

about this great multiplication table, which has never been ex-
ceeded, and which is only equalled by Crelle's Rechentafeln,

13, 1608, Herwart mentions that he' has been in the habit of
Ujing a special praxis for avoiding the labour of multiplication,
and which his friends have recommended him to print He
adds that without it he should long ago have had to give up all
mathematics which involved calculation, on account of his many
occupations and because he was not a good computer. He encloses
a page as a specimen. Kepler replies that he thinks the table
will be useful, and he urges that its uses in the solution of
spherical triangles should be noticed, pointing out its superiority
in point of clearness to the "-trpotrBiupatpuris Vitichiana," which
is too complicated to be retained in the memory. Herwart re-
plies that he had already thought of its application in prostha-
phxresis ; he suggests a title lor the book, and asks for Kepler's
opinion ; and in the last letter of the correspondence Kepler pro-
poses the title "'S.uaaxOaa sive Novoc Tabula;, quibus Arithme-
tic! debitis inextricabilibus multiplicand! et dividendi liberantur,
ingenio, tempori, viribusque ratiocinantis consulitur." It is thus
proved that the table was printed from a manuscript which Her-
wart used himself, and which very likely he had had made. As
for the word prosthaphajresis, it is well known that the prostha-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
phairesis of the orbit is the angle subtended at the planet by the
eccentricity, and De Morgan explained the use of the word on
the title-page thus: "Prosthaphajresis is a word compounded of
prosthesis and aphxresis, and means addition and subtraction.
Astronomical corrections sometimes additive and sometimes sub-
tractive were called prosthaphoereses. The constant necessity for
multiplication in forming proportional parts for the corrections
gave rise to this table, which had the name of its application on
its title-page." But the prosthaplncresis referred to seems most
likely a method of solving spherical triangles in which the pro-
duct of two sines or of a sine and cosine is avoided by the use of
formulx such as sin a sin b = \ {cos (a - l>) - cos (a + b) J, and
such a method is associated with the name of Wittich. This
explains all Kepler's allusions, and why Herwart employed the
word on his title-page, as he proposed to avoid the necessity of
the transformation by rendering easy the operation of the simple
multiplication. A copy of Herwart's woik borrowed, through
the kindness of Prof. Henrici, from the Graves Library at Uni-
versity College, London, was exhibited to the meeting.

MR. GLADSTONE AT GREENWICH
WE may surely regard it as a hopeful sign of pro-
gress that a whole page of the Times, as well as
of other daily papers, of last Friday was practically
devoted to the discussion of matters connected with
Science and Art. When we find the daily papers giving
so great prominence to these subjects, and when men of
such position and mark as Prince Leopold, Mr. Glad-
stone, and the Lord Chief Justice, take what is evidently
a genuine interest in the progress of science and art
education among the lower classes, it seems quite safe to
infer that this movement has at last taken a prominent
and important place in the everyday life of the country.
Prince Leopold, in his address at Oxford, showed that
he had taken some pains to become acquainted with the
latest statistics of the Science and Art classes. The discre-
pancy between Prince Leopold's statistics and, those
of Mr. Gladstone has been commented upon in the Times.
It would appear from an examination of the last Report
of the Science and Art Department, however, that the
figures which Prince Leopold gives for the number of
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
students under instruction in science are probably the
number of papers -worked at the last May examinations.
This, possibly, is an error in reporting. Mr. Gladstone,
on the other hand, gives the right number—" about
48,0005"—of the students under instruction last January;
a different number, of course, to that in May 1874, when
it was 53.050, or in May 1875, which has not yet been
published, as far as we are aware. But in some way he
has arrived at, or been furnished with, a wrong total for
the number of Art students. This should be 54,800 odd,
irrespective of the scholars in Elementary Day Schools.
At the same time it is gratifying that a man like Mr.
Gladstone should think it worth his while to take an
interest in the matter at all, but when he does deter-
mine to think about it, the least he can do is to inform
himself correctly as to statistics.
Mr. Gladstone set himself almost entirely to impress
upon his audiencej the value of an education in the
principles and practice of art; he attempted to show
that really artistic handiwork had not only a refining,
elevating influence even on the workman himself, but
that it answered the requirement of utility in the best
sense of the term. To his advocacy of the introduction of
artistic taste into the commonest manufactures we can have
no possible objection, but we distinctly demur to the ground
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
on which he seems to have based the prominence that he
gave it in his address. He found—wrongly, it appears—
from the statistics that the proportion of students attend-
ing the Science classes was considerably larger than that
of those who are attending the Art classes. According
to the latest statistics this excess of Science over Art
students is shown not to exist, and the inference that
Science is getting more than its due share of attention,
and that the claims of Art require special advocacy as
being neglected, seems to us unwai ranted on several
grounds. The truth is the Art classes were established for
many years before the Science classes, and the fact that
there has been such a rush upon the latter simply proves
that they meet a wider and deeper want than do the
Vol. xhi.— No. 316
former; that, in short, the nation feels that it stands more
urgently in need of science at present than of art.
We infer, moreover, from what Mr. Gladstone said, that
he thinks the practical application of science ought to be en-
dowed in preference to abstract scientific investigation and
education in scientific principles. But is it not much more

more and more extended, her methods are becoming
more and more complicated, and her instruments more
and more expensive; in almost every department paths
are being opened up which, if pursued to their end, would
ceriainly lead to discoveries of vital importance to the
best welfare and prosperity of the nation. Our public
men are continually telling us that we are being out-
stripped by continental nations in fields which used to
be peculiarly our own, and that simply because abroad
every encouragement is given to scientific research, while
here its existence is either ignored or it is regarded as a
mere pastime. We can only think that Mr. Gladstone
must have been imperfectly informed, or that he felt him-
self bound for the occasion to assume the position of
special pleader on behalf of Art, which really ..can take
vei y good care of herself.
We are grateful, however, for the unmistakable manner
in which he referred to the City Companies. He put the
case exactly as it ought to be put, and did not in the least
exaggerate the crying scandal. Their pharisaical trum-
peting of the pittances they dole out in the way of

ful way in which they discharge the stewardship of the
enormous funds committed to thtir trust. What are these
eleemosynary pittances compared to the sums they
lavish yearly on their ponderous entertainments, relics of
long past generations, when men were some stages
nearer the lower animals than they are now, but
which are now meaningless and out of date? These
Corporations, though there are some wide-awake, prac-
tical, and, v.e must believe, advanced and cultivated
men among them, seem to be quite unconscious of
thtir lethargic, antiquated, and even dangerous position.
We say "dangerous," for it is high time they should
know that if they do not wake up out of their lethargy, and
set their own house in order, they must very soon be
wakened by a shock from without. The country cannot
much longer forbear calling them to give an account

fear they must reneier. It cannot be tolerated that while
the advancement of the highest interests of the country is

for useful knowledge with healthy and invigorating food,
which at the same time stimulated a craving for more. We
believe that in this way the Messrs. Chambers have done
much to create the general want among the middle and

evidently been done. We have examined carefully
a large number of the articles, and of course the scien-
tific ones especially, and considering the purpose and
plan of the work, there is really very little room for criti-
cism. All the scientific articles have evidently been
written by men who have special knowledge of their sub-
jects, and as a rule arc masterly specimens of condensa-
tion, clear statement, and wonderful fulness of information.
Such names of contributors as Tait, Deutsch, Alex. Bain,
Alex. Buchan, Goldstiicker, Dr. G. E. Day, Keith Johnston,
Dr. Birch, Pengelly, Francis Francis, and many others, are
guarantees that in all the principal departments thoroughly
competent men have been secured to write. But while with
such contributors the quality of the information was bound
to be up to the mark, the Encyclopaedia would have suffered
much in other respects without a thoroughly competent
organising head. 11 is, no doubt, mainly due to Dr. Findlater
that uniformity and due proportion have been secured, and
that throughout perfect clearness has been maintained.
His singular adaptation to fill the post of editor of such a
work has largely contributed to its success.

But it is not only in the larger and more important
articles that accuracy and care are apparent; even in
the case of unimportant towns which may occupy
only three or four lines, the information may be
depended on, and in the case of British towns at least;
was obtained, we believe, in almost every instance
at first hand from some one on the spot. But down to
the minutest details throughout the work constant and
thoroughly intelligent and competent editorial care is
evident, and if the Messrs. Chambers are careful to keep
their work up to date, and bring out new editions at the
proper times, they need hardly fear a rival.
The edition which lies before us is not strictly a new, but
a revised edition; the work has not been reset, and but little
increase has been made in the number of articles. We
have, however, taken pains to compare some of the prin-
cipal scientific articles in the new edition with the corre-
sponding ones in the old, and in every case, where it has
been really necessary for such a work, a competent
revising hand is evident. "Chemistry," for example;
which was first written twelve years ago, has been brought
fairly up to date, and, as chemists know, this implies a
great deal. By a few additional sentences in "Astronomy,"
the direction of the most striking recent researches is
indicated; so in "Meteorology" and other articles.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Indeed, it is quite evident that the work has been subjected
to a thorough revision, and that considerable alterations
have been effected, quite sufficient to keep the work fresh
until a completely new edition is called for: not a,few
of the articles have been entirely re-written. The illus-
trations are copious and, in the main, accurate and well-
drawn, and there is an excellent selection of maps.
Of course there are points in the work that are open to
criticism ; some subjects may seem inadequately treated,
and others at too great length, and evidences of
local bias are occasionally apparent, while there is a
tendency in many of the biographical articles, to
ambitious writing and the " higher criticism," which are a
little out of place in a staid book of reference. But these
are matters of comparatively small importance, in which
Dr. Findlater is probably a much better judge than we.
Of the sterling merits of the work throughout there can
be no mistake, and it will Llong remain a monument of
Messrs. Chambers's enterprise and public spirit, and of Dr.
Findlater's practical skill, judiciousnes,s and power of
organisation., not to say wide and accurate knowledge.

shrub is indigenous, but a large population is at hand
who are only too ready to work for a fair remuneration. It
may perhaps be forgotten by many that the ancient his-
torian Pliny calls attention to the "wool-bearing trees
of Ethiopia." In the days of Herodotus, whose descrip-
tions of Egypt are so graphic, cotton was unknown, and
the Egyptians were renowned for the manufacture of the
finest linen from the native flax; it was only in the reign
of Mehemet Ali Pacha, the grandfather of the present
Khedive, that cotton was introduced into Egypt. Curiously
enough, this was seed from the " wool-bearing trees of
Ethiopia," which was brought into Egypt by an enter-
prising French traveller upon his return from the Soudan.
When we consider the important assistance that was ren-
dered to England by Egypt during the American civil
wir by an extraordinaiy effort in the production of
cotton, we must feel a more than usual interest in the
development of the vast cotton-producing resources of
the Soudan. It is the natural hot-bed of the cotton
plant, where it has existed from time immemorial; we
have only to construct a railway either to the Port of
Souakim on the Red Sea, or direct to Cairo according to
the plan of Mr. Fowler, and the Soudan will at_ once
deliver its vast burden of riches.

by the vegetable obstructions on the White Nile, it was
quite impossible to carry out his original idea of joining
the expedition of Sir Samuel Baker. The enterprising
Governor of the Soudan, Moomtaz Pacha, showed him
every attention, and invited him to an excursion by
steamer up the White Nile. During this voyage Mr.

their extensions; in the new lake of Col. Long; at the

will dismiss the "new lake of Col. Long," but remind
Mr. Southworth that he has omitted the most powerful
of the White Nile affluents—the Sobat—N. lat. 90 21'!
There can be no doubt the Victoria N'yanza is a mighty
reservoir or principal source of the Nile, and the friends
of the lamented Capt. Speke will rejoice in the triumph of
his discovery now rendered certain by the survey of Mr.
Stanley. The Albert N'yanza has never been visited by
any Europeans except Sir Samuel and Lady Baker in
February 1864; thus nearly twelve years have elapsed
since its discovery, and yet no European has been able to
reach its shores, although its waters were again sighted
by Sir S. Baker during the expedition of the Khedive of
Egypt.

in exploring the Great Basin of the Nile, which will prove

These extracts from the preface sufficiently explain the

in fulfilling the promise of his preface. He has produced a

astronomical observations that ever one man made in twelve
months,—there was no apparent reason why he should not at
once have been allowed to step straight into this new Observa-
tory appointment, and commence its laborious duties forthwith.
But that was not to be ; for he was privately informed that he
must first and preliminarily be appointed a Professor in the
University of Edinburgh. He started at and resisted the idea;
he said he did not want to be a Professor, and would not be
one ; it was an occupation wholly foreign to his tastes, and
entirely incompatible with the full and conscientious devotion of
himself to being a working astronomer within the Observatory.
Pressure, however, of powerful friends was brought to bear upon
him ; and he was made to understand that Government could
not, or would not, whatever the secret reason, create and set
agoing the new appointment for the Observatory on the Calton
Hill, of "Astronomer Royal for Scotland," without first con-
necting it with a certain old and shameful sinecure in the

lie was indeed assured that he would, and should, never be
called on to lecture in the Professorship; that it was a mere
name and nothing more ; and his form of appointment to the
strangely and unnaturally duplex post of the old Professorship
and the new Astronomer Royalship, was made out in words
assigning clearly enough the work in the Observatory, of "with
zeal and diligence making observations for the extension and
improvement of astronomy, geography, and navigation, and
other branches of science connected therewith," to be his only
circle of duties and his only claim to salary, viz. 300/. per

how were they neglected and overborne when the multitudinous
heads of the gTeat educational University of Edinburgh had once
got poor Thomas Henderson, the first Astronomer Royal for
¦Scotland, safe within their thrall as being also a Professor before
them?
Why thus: they Immediately began Jtreading on his toes from
every side; and with the most magnificent disregard that he had
anything worthy of notice to do in the Observatory,, they forced
on his attention, both in season and out of it, "that while they
*ere working so hard in the great educational hive, he was a
mere drone, and yet was in receipt of a salary of 300/. per
annum, an absolutely larger salary than any of themselves who
bore the brunt and burden of the tuition of all the students."
For the complainers, be it remarked, left out of view, that if

their incomes did not mount up to 300/. in the shape of salaries,
it was because they came to them chiefly in the form of students'
fees ; and in that phase sometimes reached 1,000/., 1,300/., and
even 1,600/. per annum.
Hut this difference the teaching Professors cou.d not see;

was talked at; and talked at, until for one winter he was prevailed
on to give lectures in the University to the Mathematical Class

up the onerous position of Secretary to certain University trusts.

The Origin of our Numerals
Mr. Donisthorpe's ingenious construction of our numerals
by corresponding numbers of lines (Nature, vol. xii. p. 476)
inriuces me to offer a few remarks on this subject, which has a
l'terature of its own. There can be no doubt, I believe, that
our forms were derived directly from the Arab series called
(lobar; that the Arabs had them from the Indians, and the
Indians from the Chinese. My esteemed friend Dr. Wilson, of
Bombay, published a "Note on the Origin of the Units of the
Indian and European numerals," in 1858,* in which he showed

ths derivation of some of our numerals from ancient Indian
forms found on cave inscriptions of Western India, on the Bnilsa
Topes, and on coins. My remarks are founded wholly on the
forms given in this note, which is little known, 1 believe, in
England.
Dr. Wilson obtains our first four numeral forms from the
Chinese, traced through different Indian script characters nearly
as supposed by Mr. Donisthorpe. One, two, three horizontal
bars and a square for 4. lie also finds the eight in the forms
II ll CD > an^ CO on tne cave inscriptions.
Before proceeding to the other numerals I wish to notice a
rule which may be deduced from the consideration of the cKanges
in the forms of numerals in passing from one people to another,
that the same form may be turned through angles of 900 or lSo°,
and may be inverted or reversed without altering its value.
Even the same people have used a form turned in different ways
for the same numeral. The Arabs used their 2, 3, and 4 in two
ways, making angles of 90° with each other; the 2, 4, and 5 of
Sacro Hosco and Roger Bacon were the Indian script Modi (and
ours) turned through 180°, or upside down; other examples will
be noticed.
The most important derivation by Dr. Wilson is that from
the Chinese —4— ten; this is found on the Bhilsa Topes with a

138 planets—materials for calculation not being available
in four cases—and accurate opposition-ephemerides are
given where the elements have been perturbed to the

prepared. The initiated in these matters will be aware
that a work of this extent involves a vast amount of
labour, which will be greatly increased with the present
rate of discoveries of new members of the group of
small planets.
In some few instances the perturbations have been
determined with every possible precision, with a parti-
cular object in view, as in the case of Themis, the motion
of which was rigorously investigated by Dr. Kriiger, for a
determination of the mass of Jupiter; and for those
planets whose perturbations have been thrown into the
form of Tables, it was also necessary to settle the elements
with great accuracy, though the results have not been in
every case so satisfactory as might have been expected.

allow of their being identified without much difficulty with
the equatorial, and the errors of the predicted places being

NATURE
When we first began teaching botany and chemistry here,
1 was so strongly impressed by the truth of this view of
the proper place of science in education, that I started by
making the boys examine flowers and do simple reactions
without making them learn anything by heart, hoping to
induce them to collect their facts and build up their
science for themselves. The result was that they did not
know what to do with the facts which they collected, and
kept losing them as fast as they picked them up. But
since the botany boys have been set to learn the chart by
heart, and since the chemistry boys have been using a
text-book,the progressmade has beenfarmore satisfactory.
A young child's reasoning powers are so feeble that he
needs to be constantly guided in the use of them, and
before being set to observe he requires to be furnished
with a "cadre" in which to arrange his battalions of
facts.
It may be asked why botany and chemistry should be
chosen in preference to other sciences, such as geology or
physics, which might seem likely to prove more attractive
to boys. Botany was chosen because it is purely a sci-

ence of perception, of observation and co-ordination of
existing facts, and because it calls into play and directs
into a useful channel that natural propensity of boys to
collect and classify which is seen in butterfly catching and
stamp albums. A good deal more might be made of
entomology than has hitherto been attempted, but it is
rather a holiday than a school subject, the bases of its
classification are too minute and even arbitrary, and it has
the disadvantage of leading almost of necessity up to sub-
jects too wide for boys to grasp. Chemistry was chosen
because it is a science of reflection, and forms the best
introduction to the experimental method. In chemical
analysis a boy has first to produce the results on which
he must afterwards exercise his reason; he has to reflect
on and draw his conclusions from not only what he sees,
but what he does. He thus learns never to do anything
without knowing why he does it and what result he expects
to obtain. Chemistry also has the advantage of giving a
first insight into the practical applications of mathematics.
That indeed is the part of the subject which the majority
of boys find most difficult. It is rare to find a boy who
will readily work out arithmetically even a simple reaction.
In the only possible rival to chemistry—physics—the
simpler phenomena are much less varied and interesting,

reasoning from effect to cause less patent, and there are
comparatively few experiments which a child could per-
form for itself. Physics form an admirable lecture subject,
but even then the necessary mathematical reasoning is
far beyond the capacity of an average boy of twelve.
Such subjects as geology and astronomy may be made
most interesting, and a great deal may be done by direct-
ing children's attention to the physical actions going on
in the world around them, but they are what, from a
schoolmaster's point of view, I should call informational
rather than educational sciences, their phenomena are
generally too vast for a child's mind really to exercise
itself upon them.
It will have been noticed that in no case are we able to
give to science the full six hours per week recommended
by the Commissioners. I would gladly do so, but do not
think that it would be possible unless the standard for
the classical entrance scholarships at the public schools,
which of necessity fixes that of the first class at private
schools, were lower than it is now, and although the
entrance scholarships have raised this standard con-

doing their ordinary more varied work. Though some
part of this might be owing to his being outside the
regular classes, yet by far the greater part was due to the
monotonous work palling upon him and dulling his
brain.
The education of young children should be made like
their picture-books. The pictures should be such as will
induce the little learner to read and study the letterpress
in order to find out more about them, and for that pur-
pose they can scarcely be too numerous. A boy when his
mind first opens to the world around him is like a man in
a large strange house. He must needs go about and
learn the arrangement of the building, peer into every
room, examine the varied prospect from every window,
before he can decide which rooms he will make his own;
but when once he has made his choice, he will probably
keep to one or two rooms and seldom enter the others.*

TION TO THE RESISTANCE OF SHIPSi
""pHE address of the President of a Section would year by year
"*• possess an appropriate interest, if it coukl always consist of
an exposition of the progress made during the past year in the
department ot science which the Section embraces. And many
of the addresses to this and other sections have conformed to this
pattern with marked success.
But the adequate preparation of an address shaped in this
approved mould would require a range of experience and a grasp
of thought such as few possess ; and custom lias wisely sanctioned
a type of address which, though less appropriate to the occasion,
need not be either uninteresting or inapposite. And we, in this
Section, have not to search far for instances in which its Presi-
dent has charmed and instructed us by a masterful exposition of
some single subject in practical science, or by a timely reminder
of the improvident manner in which we deal with some precious
store of natural wealth.
I must express a hope that it will not be regarded as a conver-
sion of liberty into license, if the subject I have chosen obliges
me to introduce a further innovation, and to use diagrams and
experiments in order to make my meaning clear.
I propose to treat of certain of the fundamental principles
which govern the behaviour of fluid, and this with special refer-
ence to the resistance of ships. By the term "resistance" I
mean the opposing force which a ship experiences in its progress
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
through the water.
Considering the immense aggregate amount of power expended
in the propulsion of ships, or, in other words, in overcoming the
resistance of ships, I trust you will look favourably on an attempt
to elucidate the causes of this resistance. It is true that im-
proved results in ship-building have been obtained through accu-
mulated experience; but it unfortunately happens that many of
the theories by which this experience is commonly interpreted,
are interwoven with fundamental fallacies, which, passing for
principles, lead to mischievuus results when again applied beyond
the limits of actual experience.
The resistance experienced by ships is but a branch of the
general question ol the forces which act on a body moving
through a fluid, and has within a comparatively recent period
been placed in an entirely new light by what is commonly called
the theory of stream-lines.
The theory as a whole involves mathematics of the highest
order, reaching alike beyond my ken and my purpose; but I
believe that, so far as it concerns the resistance of ships, it can
be sufficiently understood without the help of technical mathe-
matics; and I will endeavour to explain the course which I have

that its figure is perfectly symmetric on either side of C, the
middle point of its length.
1 .ct us now assume that the pipe has a stream of perfect fluid
Fig. 1.
running through it from A towards E, and that the pipe is free
to move bodily endways.
It is not unnatural to assume at first sight that the tendency of
the fluid would be to push the pipe forward, in virtue of the
opposing surfaces offered by the bends in it—that both the
divergence between A and C from the original line at A, and the
return between C and E to that line at E, would place parts of
the interior surface of the pipe in some manner in opposition to
the stream or flow, and that the flow thus obstructed would drive
the pipe forward ; but if we endeavour to build up these supposed
causes in detail, we find the reasoning to be illusory.
I will now trace the results which can be established by correct
reasoning.
The surface being assumed to be smooth, the fluid, being a
perfect fluid, can exercise no drag by friction or otherwise on the
side of the pipe in the direction of its length, and in fact can
exercise no force on the side of the pipe, except at right angles to it.

No* the fluid flowing round the curve from A to B will, no doubt,
have to be deflected from its course, and, by what is commonly
known as centrifugal action, will press against the outer side of
the curve, and this with a determinable force. The magnitude
and direction of this force at each portion of the curve of the
pipe between A and 1! are represented by the small arrows
marked/; and the aggregate of these forces between A and B is
represented by the larger arrow marked G. In the same way
the forces acting on the parts BC, C D, and D E are indicated by
the arrows H, I, and J ; and as the conditions under which the
fluid passes along each of the successive parts of the pipe are
precisely alike, it follows that the four forces are exactly equal,
and, as shown by the arrows in the diagram, they exactly
neutralise one another in virtue of their respective directions;
and therefore the whole pipe from A to E, considered as a rigid
single structure, is subject to no disturbing force by reason of
the fluid running through it.
Though this conclusion that the pipe is not pushed endways
may appear on reflection so obvious as to have scarcely needed
elaborate proof, I hope that it has not seemed needless, even
though tedious, to follow somewhat in detail the forces that act,
and which are, under the assumed conditions, the only forces
that act, on a symmetrical pipe such as I have supposed.
Having shown that in the case of this special symmetrically
curved pipe the flow of a perfect fluid through it does not tend

to push it endways, I will now proceed to show that this is also
the case whatever may be the outline of the pipe, provided that
its beginning and end are in the same straight line.
Assume a pipe bent, and its ends joined so as to form a com-
plete circular ring, and the fluid within it running with velocity
round the circle. This fluid, by centrifugal force, exercises a
uniform outward pressure on every part of the uniform curve;
and this is the only force the fluid Can exert. This pressure
tends to tear the ring asunder, and causes a uniform longitudinal
tension on each part of the ring, in the same manner as the
pressure within a cylindrical boiler makes a uniform tension on
the shell of the boiler.
Now, in the case of fluid running round within rings of various
diameter, just as in the case of railway trains running round
curves of various diameter, if the velocity along the curve remain
the same, the outward pressure on each part of the circumference
is less, in proportion as the diameter becomes greater ; but the
circumferential tens on of the pipe is in direct proportion to the
pressure and to the diameter ; and since the pressure has been
shown to be inversely as the diameter, the tension for a given
velocity will be the same, whatever be the diameter.

As a simple form of this experiment, if a chain be set rotating
at a very high velocity over a pulley in the manner shown in
Fig 6, it will be seen that the centrifugal forces do not tend to
disturb the path of the running chain ; and, indeed, the velocity
being extremely great, the forces, in fact, tend to preserve the
path of the chain in opposition to any disturbing cause. On the

tion has been lent to me by Sir YV. Thomson. It is one which
he has used on many occasions for the same purpose; and I
must add that the proposition in his hands has formed the basis
of conclusions incomparably deeper and more important than
those to which I am now directing your attention.
You observe the chain when at rest hangs in the ordinary
catenary form, from a large pulley with a very wide-mouthed
groove and mounted in a frame which is secured to the ceiling.
By a simple arrangement of multiplying bands the pulley is
driven at a high speed, carrying the chain round by the frictional
adhesion of its upper semi-circumference. When at its highest
speed the chain travels about 40 j>er second.
The idea that the chain when thus put in motion will be dis-
turbed by its centrifugal force from the shape it holds while at
rest must point to one of two conclusions ; either (1) the chain
will tend to open out into a complete circle, or (2) it will on the
contrary tend to stretch itself at its lower bend to a curvature
of infinite sharpness.
But you observe that no tendency to either change of form
appears. On the contrary, the chain, instead of taking spon-
taneously any new form in virtue of its centrifugal force, has
plainly assumed a condition under which it is with difficulty dis-
turbed, alike from its existing form, or from any other which I
communicate to it by violently striking it. Such blows locally
indent it almost as they would bend a bar of lead.

In spite, however, of this quasi-rigidity which its velocity has
imparted to it, it does, if left to itself, slowly assume, as you
perceive, a curious little contortion, both as it approaches and as
it recedes from the lower bend of the catenary ; and it is both
interesting and instructive to trace the cause of the deformation.
I have already explained that the speed of the chain subjects
it throughout to longitudinal tension. Speaking quantitatively,
the tension is equal to the weight of a length of the chain twice
the height due_to"the velocity. This is —, and thus, as the
speed is 40'feet per second, = 50 feet,'or with this chain
about 14 lbs.
Now in travelling through the lower bend of the catenary,
the chain passes from being nearly straight, to being sharply
curved and immediately straightened again, and this change of
form involves a continued pivoting of link within link, the fric-
tion being called into action by the tension which presses the
surfaces together. Each link thus in succession resists this
pivoting with a definite force, and the resistance, in effect, con-
verts what appears to be a perfectly flexible combination into
one possessing a tangible degree of stiffness, and the oblique

A correspondent at Belfast has sent us specimens of the
caterpillar of Arctii eaja, telling us at the same time that during
this season, in which they have been particularly numerous, he
has noticed that they have done much injury to textile fabrics laid
on grass to bleach, by perforating them in circular holes, spe-
cially during sunshine after rain. The holes they make vary in
size, some being very small, others large enough to admit the
body of the animal. They are usually in clusters, and each is
generally surrounded by a greenish coloured matter, npparcntly
ejected by the caterpillar. This habit of Arctia eaja is quite
new to entomologists.

THIRD REPORT OF THE SETTLE CA VE
COMMITTEE (VICTORIA CA VE) *

when it was stopped for want of funds), at a cost of 175/. lis. yd.i

Great progress has lieen made in the past year in uncovering
the glacial deposits at the entrance of the cave, and showing
their relation to the older bone-beds containing the remains
of man with the extinct animals. The boulders are seen to
cover an area of at least 1,200 square feett They are of all sizes,
and consist of dark and white Carboniferous Limestone, and the
basement bed of that formation, Carboniferous Gritstone, and
Silurian Grit Some have travelled at least two miles, and others
greater distance*. They are various in size, from mere sand-grains
to blocks several ttms in weight. An interesting section was dis-
played, showing the passage of the boulder-beds in one part from
a regular till witli large scratched stones, through scratched
gravel, sand, to laminated clay, and these were so interbedded as

to demonstrate that some at least of the laminated clay is of
glacial age and origin.
At length, after six years' work, we are able to say that we
have reached the floor of the cave at the entrance. Several
pinnacles of rock have been found by the removal of the
boulders; they run in lines parallel with the joints of the rock
above, and give testimony to the cave having been at some time
occupied by a stream, similar rock-weathering occurring in other
water-caves in Craven. The arched niches on the right of the
cave at the entrance lead to the same conclusion.
And now, with the additional evidence of another year's
diggings, we may again consider the question, the most interesting
perhaps of all the problems before us: Are the glacial deposits
which rest upon the older bone-beds, containing the extinct
mammals and man, in the position which they occupied at the
close of the glacial conditions, or have they subsequently fallen
into their present site? We may again urge the reasons given
last year (see Second Report), strengthened by enlarged sections
and a wider experience, which go to prove the first alternative.
To these arguments we may now add the following :—That the
extent of the glacial deposits now exposed is so great that it is
impossible that they can be a mere chance accumulation of
boulders which have been re-deposited in their present position
since glacial times. This being the case, it is clear from the
position of the boulders beneath all the screes, that they are a
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
portion of the general glacial covering of the valleys and hill-
sides which was left by the ice-sheet at the time of its disap-
pearance.
These are the main arguments to be derived from the cave
itself, but further strong presumptive evidence, that the Pleisto-
cene fauna lived in the North of England before the ice-sheet,
exists as follows :—The older fauna once lived in this district, a
point which admits of no dispute from its existence in the Vic-
toria Cave, in Kirkdale Cave, Raygill Cave in Lothersdale, and
perhaps in other caves, hut their bones are now found nowhere
in the open country. None of the river-gravels contain them;
and just that district which is conspicuous by their absence, is
also remarkable for the strongest evidences of great glaciation.
Putting these facts together, the probability is very strong that
it was glaciation that destroyed their remains in the open country.
To suppose that these have been destroyed by other sub-aerial
agencies, would be to ignore the fact that in the South of England
and other non-glaciated areas, such remains exist both in the
caves and river-gravels.
A few bones were found lying upon the boulders beneath the
talus. They have been determined where possible by Prof.

fact, we may, perhaps, in conclusion, lie permitted to indulge in
a short flight of fancy. Let us endeavour to realise how great is
the distance in time which separates the savage of Craven from
our own day. We have the history of much of it in the Victoria
Cave itself, and we may restore some of the missing pages from
the surrounding district.
At the cave, Roman times are separated from our own by
sometimes less than one, but not more than two, feet of talus,
the chips which time detachesfrom the cliffs above. The Neolithic
age, which antiquaries know was a considerable time before the
Roman occupation, is represented by a layer in some places four
or five feet beneath the Roman, in others even running into it.
Then comes a thickness of 19 feet of talus without a record of
any living thing. Judging by the shallowness of the Roman
layer, this must represent an enormous interval of time. And
this takes us down to the boulders, the inscribed records of the
Glacial Period. They must represent a long series of climatal
changes, during which the ice was waxing and waning, advancing
and melting back over the mouth of the Victoria Cave. This
period saw the Reindeer and the Grisly Bear occasionally in
possession. Then we have an unconformity, a break in the

continuity of the deposits, the boulders lying on the edges of
the older beds. Time again! and that time long enough for
changes to take place which allowed the district to cool down
from a warmth suitable to the Hippopotamus, and become a
fitting pasture-ground for the Reindeer. It was in that warm
period that the early Craven savage lived and died.
But these are not all the changes which teamed in the North
of Kugland since that time. The age of the great submergence
represented by the sea beaches of M' el Tryfaen anl Maccles-
field, and by the Middle-Sands and-Gravels of Lancashire, has
left no record up at the cave. Vour reporter is of opinion that
the submergence did not attain in that district a greater depth
than six or seven hundred feet, and this would still leave the
cue 75° fCL't abr ve the sea, though it would cut up the land
into a group of islands. The fact is sufficient for us, the depth
is immater al.
Upon no fact are geologists Letter agreed than upon the exist-
ence of a wide-spread sul'mergence and emergence of land to-
wards the close (it tiie Glacial l'eriod. No tradition is common
to more races and religions than that of a great deluge. Where
back in the pa--t is the common point whence these two far-
travelled, airuost parallel rays of truth had their oiigin? In the
opinion of your reporter the Craven savage who lived before the

from the "Passage-beds" of the Ototara series in Woodpecker
Bay, Brighton, on the west coast of the south island of New

chius, A.? Milne-Edw., which includes six species from the
Eocene of southern Europe. Its nearest ally is H. quadrilo-
balus, Desmar , but its carapace is much more tumid, especially
in the branchial and gastric regions; the surface of the anterior
half of the carapace is nearly smooth, and that of the posterior
half finely granulated. The rostrum is short and very obtusely
tricuspidale, the orbits shallow and rounded, the hepatic margin
bluntly toothed, with a stronger tooth at theepibranchial angles;

larger than the left hand. The specimen was a female. For this
species the author proposed the name of Harpactocarrdnus
tumulus. Dr. Hector explained the sequence of formations in the
locality from which the above crab was derived, and stated that the
Ototara series is to be regarded as Cretaceo-Tertiary, containing
some fossils of decidedly Cretaceous type, such as Saurian bones
and fragmentary Inocerami, and other forms that are associ-
ated with decidedly Mesoroic fossils in the underlying strata.
On the other hand, the occurrence of Tertiary forms such as
Nautilus ziczac (or a nearly allied form), the gigantic Penguin
{Palaeudyptcs antarctuus, Huxl.), and a Turtle, indicate a fauna
not unlike that at present existing in the vicinity.—On a remark-
able fossil Orthopterous Insect from the Coal-measures of Britain,

indicating the importance of the examination of thf Clay-iron-
stone nodules of the Coal-measures, in which so mn / valuable
fossils have been discovered, including the remarkable insect
described in the present paper. The specimen displays the
characters of the four wings, only two of which, however, are
nearly perfect, and these measure 2T inches in length and 1 inch
and \\ inch in breadth, the hind wing being the broadest. The
author described in detail the characters presented by the vena-
tion of the wings, which includes three straight veins running
parallel to the fore margin, the third bifurcating near the apex, a
fourth much curved vein giving origin to six branches, and having

at its base a triangular space, from which arise the other veins of
the wing. The body appears to have been about five lines broad
between the bases of the wings. In front of the wings is the
prothorax in the form of two large, rounded, dilated, and veined
lobes; it measures fourteen lines across and six lines in length.
In front of these lobes is the head, with its eyes produced in
front into a slender process three lines long. This insect is con-
sidered by the author to be most nearly related to the Mantida;,
the characters of the head and thorax especially being to some
extent paralleled in the existing genus Blepharis. The author
proposed to name the species Litkomantis carbonarius, and sug-
gested that Gryllacris (Corydalis) brongniarti probably belongs
to the same genus.—On the discovery of a Fossil Scorpion in
the English Coal-measures, by Mr. II. Woodward, F.R. S. The

recorded from the English Coal-measures; but in 1874 the

that Mr. Huggins had in this direction had the privilege of I

further, but there were great difficulties still to be overcome,

recently been engaged in some experiments with a view to ascer-
tain the best alloy for use in thermopiles. The thermo-electric

its power for conducting heat or electricity, or with its voltaic
relation to other metals, neither does it appear to have any rela-
tion to specific gravities or atomic weights. The thermopiles
employed were of a form slightly modified from that employed
by Pouillct in his demonstration of Ohm's law. Alloys are

frequently more powerful th^n elementary metals, thus: 2 parts
antimony and I part zinc have a negative power represented by
2270, while that of antimony is 696 or 9/43, and of zinc is
0'2. A strange exception, however, is that of bismuth ami tin,
for while the power of bismuth is + 35'8, when the two metals
are alloyed in the proportion of 12 to 1, the power becomes
— 13'67. Dr. Stone first used a couple consisting of iron and
rich German silver (that is, rich in nickel). This was charac-
terised by great steadiness, but the electromotive force produced
by moderate differences of temperature was not great. He then
used Marcus's negative alloy, consisting of 12 parts antimony,
5 of zinc, and I of bismuth, but the crystalline nature and con-
sequent brittleness of this mixture were found to be great objec-
tions to its practical use. It occurred to Dr. Stone that the
addition of arsenic might diminish the brittleness without injur-
ing the thermo-electric power, and on trial it was found that an
alloy of zinc, antimony, and arsenic, with a little tin, formed a
much less brittle mass than Marcus metal, with quite as great or
greater theimo-electric power. A set of twelve couples of this
alloy and German silver was exhibited. The electromotive forces

THE OXFORD BOTANIC GARDEN
EVERYONE who knows Oxford remembers the
quaint old Botanic Garden by Magdalen Bridge
at the foot of the High Street. Nearly two centuries and
a half have passed since St. James's Day, 1632, when the
Vice-Chancellor and the authorities of the University
walked in procession from St. Mary's Church to lay the
foundation of the main gateway afterwards completed by
Inigo Jones. The expense of this and of Jhe high stone
walls which surround the garden and protect it from the
wind exceeded 5,cco/., a large sum even in those days,
but which was provided by the munificence of Lord
Danby, who afterwards bequeathed some property as an
endowment.
The Oxford Botanic Garden is the oldest in Britain,
and there are but two or three of earlier date in other
countries. The space of this article' would be insufficient
to do justice to the place which belongs to it and to its
successive professors in English scientific history. A few

Evelyn visited it in 1654, when "the sensitive plant
was shown as a great wonder." Twenty years after
(1676) Sir Thomas Millington, the Savilian Professor, first
divined the fundamental fact of sexual reproduction in
flowering plants. Five years later (1681) Bobart, "over-
seer of the physick gardens," experimentally demon,
strated the function of pollen. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century the Oxford Botanic Garden solved
another great problem. Although Ferns bear no flowers,
the world shared the opinion of Columna that they must
have flower-produced seeds, because, amongst other
reasons, "the book of Genesis said nothing about
plants being destitute of them." Fern seed then came
to be regarded as existent although invisible, and then by
a not unusual transition as the cause of invisibility in its
possessors. Morison (1715) disposed of these fancies by
demonstrating that the asexual spores of Ferns were
actually their means of reproduction. In 1736 the garden
—then under the charge of Dillenius, the editor of the
third edition of Ray's " Synopsis," and the author of the
"Historia Muscorum"—was visited by Linnaeus. Here
he resided for some weeks, and many particulars have
come down to us of discussions amongst the living plants
in which he endeavoured to convert Dillenius to his newly
published Sexual System. Passing over Sibthorp and his

splendid work on the Botany of Greece, it must not be
forgotten that in the Oxford Botanic Garden Daubeny
anticipated Draper in demonstrating (1836) that the light
belonging to the red end of the spectrum is most effectual
in promoting the evolution of oxygen by plants. There
is something perhaps characteristic of the habits of forty
years ago in his using port wine as one of his absorptive
media.
It might be supposed that a place so venerable in its
aspect, so interesting in its traditions, would be a source
of some pride to the members of an ancient University,
and that they would be anxious to give it the needful sup-
port to enable it to be as useful now as it has been in the
past Unhappily, the facts show the reverse of this.

Notwithstanding the efforts of the present professor, the
garden and its buildings have been for some time allowed
by the University to sink into neglect, and it is now pro-
posed—mainly at the instance of the Regius Professor of
Medicine—to abandon the site altogether and create a new
garden in the modern suburb of Oxford and in the vicinity

bers of the University will of course not be satisfied
unless the time of the gardeners is pretty fully occu-
pied with decorative floriculture. Comparing such a
prospect with the old Garden, one turns to a place whose
trim extent is ample for purposes of study, whose old-
fashioned aspect is pleasing to the eye without much
need of "bedding out," and which is supplied with sub-
stantial buildings well adapted for library, herbarium,
laboratory, and museum, or which might be made so at
comparatively little expense. It is true that the green-
houses are dilapidated and antiquated, but they could be
reconstructed against one of the old walls, and this at a
much less cost than they could be erected in the " Parks."
The hammer and the chisel resound throughout Oxford.
The great court of Christ Church is to be surrounded
with useless cloisters. The University Church, having
been restored thirty years ago, is to be re-restored in a
more critical manner. The beautiful old library of the
Bodleian is in no small peril. The secret of all this is
easy to read. A new distribution of the funds of the
University and colleges is believed to be imminent. From

cne point of view it is desirable that these should be
husbanded to the last penny, in order that new endow-
ments for study and research may be adequate and com-
prehensive. From the other point of view it is only desired
at Oxford stare supra antiquas vias, and the money must
be got rid of before the time of redistribution arrives.
Oxford, alas !—and those who regard her most lament it
most—has grown careless that her life should pulsate with
the life outside her. What new word in science ever now
resounds from Oxford laboratories? Her energies seem
lulled in the lethargy of a fastidious, almost feminine,
culture. Her professors cannot be denied the possession
of capacity ar.d laboiiousness, yet if perchance any new
teacher is summoned from without to join their number,
his friends lament him as one who has fallen away into
an intellectual Capua.
To examine is the crown as to be examined is the com-
mencement of an Oxford career. And those who are
content that this should be the University's "measure of
sufficiency" are only careful that buildings and appliances
ancillary to examinations and studies preparatory for
them should be after the newest fashion in taste and fitted
to excite the admiration of relatives who visit Oxford at
Commemoration-time. No one doubts that examinations
are useful, and in Oxford, at least, no one will deny that

of expression is welcome, but not at the expense of
accuracy.
Then, again, we wonder what was the object of the
translator in tacking on to many words their German
equivalent; if the meaning were doubtful to him, or
could not be rendered, that would be all very well; but
when a plain man finds in the text the statement that

solid bodies are held together " by a powerful force which
is termed the force of cohesion (Zusammenhangkraft)," he
is apt to be a little frightened. The translator possibly
felt that after the insignificance of our English term, it was
necessary to give a powerful German word to express the
powerful force. This, however, does not explain the
occurrence of German expressions elsewhere in brackets.
These little defects are perhaps incidental to the first
edition of a translation; of Prof. Lommel's work we have
already expressed our high opinion. The explanations of
phenomena are extremely clear and precise, and here

are desirable in some places to give the reader a more
complete knowledge. The chapters in which the undu-
Tig. 3 —Spectra of cruwn and flint glass.
latory theory is employed to explain the phenomena of
reflection, refraction, &c, seem to us extremely useful and
clearly written. Nowhere, in an elementary book, have
we met with so simple and elegant an explanation of the
reason why the energy of a vibration is proportional to
the square of its amplitude as that given by the author
on pp. 227 and 228.
Here is a simple experiment to illustrate the formation
of the rainbow, that we have not before seen in a text-
book;—
"Upon a glass sphere k, filled with water and having a
diameter of four centim. (ii in.), a beam of solar light of
equal or greater diameter than the sphere is allowed to
strike horizontally, and there is then seen, upon a large
screen ss, placed in front of the sphere, and per-
forated in its centre to allow the passage of the incident
rays, arranged concentrically to the aperture and at a
distance from it which is nearly equal to that of the sphere
from the screen, a beautifully coloured circle, in fact a
circular spectrum, the colours of which are arranged con-
centrically, and in such a manner that the red is outside
and the violet on the inside. At a still greater distance
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
from the centre of the screen a second similar but much
fainter circle is observed, the colours of which however
succeeded one another in the inverse order, the red appear-
ing on the inside, and the violet at the outer periphery."
(p. 122.)
The different dispersive power of bodies is instructively
shown by comparing the spectra given by crown and
flint glass (Fig. 2), wherein it is seen that although the total
dispersion, that is the length of the spectrum, is exactly
the same, the mode of dispersion is different. By the
position of the Fraunhofer lines in the two spectra, " it is
rendered evident that the less refrangible rays are more
closely approximated in passing through the flint glass,
whilst the more refrangible are separated further from one
another than by the crown glass." (p. 139.)
The difference in the nature of the dispersion is
subsequently shown (chapter xviii.) to be caused by
a difference in the rate of propagation of the various
undulations when passing through many solids and
liquids. Hence "the proposition that all kinds of

The phenomena of absorption are treated very fully in
this volume.
A pretty mode is given by the author on p. 177 of
showing how the absorption bands yielded by a coloured
body, gradually thicken, but are not displaced, when
greater depths of colouring matter are used. "To de-
monstrate this a number of gelatine discs coloured with
Fig. 4.—Absorption of colouring matter of litmus.
litmus may be used, which are placed between two
colourless glass plates in a graduated manner. If these
be placed before the slit, there will be seen in the aperture
(Fig. 4) the graduated amount of absorption correspond-
ing to the different thicknesses of the gelatine. In the
case of the thinnest layer only a thick dark band is seen
in front of D, whilst the thickest layer only permits the
red end of the spectrum to be seen. The appearance of
this spectrum explains why a layer of litmus gradually
increasing in thickness first appears whitish, then blue,
then violet, and finally purple red."

effect shown in 9 is obtained. No. 8 shows the absorp-
tion lines produced by glass containing didymium in
combination; to the eye such glass appears colourless,
but the characteristic bands in the spectrum enable the
faintest trace of that metal to be detected. Conversely
by heating the oxide of didymium to incandescence,
bright lines appear in the spectrum of the emitted light in
the place of the dark lines. As is well known, the oxides
of didymium and erbium are rare examples of glowing
solids giving a linear and not a continuous spectrum.
Concerning the production of these bright lines, Prof.
Lommel remarks further on (p. 250): "The vibrations
which the molecules of solid and fluid [liquid] bodies
exhibit under the influence of the force of cohesion, do
not prevent the simultaneous occurrence of those vibra-
tions within each molecule to which the molecule is
attuned owing to its chemical composition. As a general
rule the latter are not visible, because the bright lines
which correspond to them disappear upon the bright
background of the continuous spectrum. The charac-

ceptibly. From the law of continuity this must neces-
sarily be the case in the transition of every solid into a
gas, yet we are not aware of any definite experiments on
this point.
The reciprocity of radiation and absorption is well
illustrated by a comparison of the fluorescent and absorp-
tion spectrum of what the translator terms napthalin red;
we presume rosaniline is meant. If the solar spectrum
be projected upon a glass cell containing this liquid, the
fluorescence exhibited in Fig. 6 (2) is seen. In the upper
diagram is shown the absorption spectrum obtained by
transmitting the solar spectrum through the same solution,
and it will be clearer to the eye than it is in the diagram,
that the three regions of strong fluorescence are in the
same position as the three principal absorption bands.
By employing a solution of proper strength, it will be
found indeed that "every dark band in the absorption
spectrum corresponds to a bright band in the fluorescing
spectrum." (p. 190.)
The last diagram we give shows in an instructive
manner the irrationality of the dispersion spectrum, by

a comparison of the normal spectrum yielded by a diffrac-
tion grating with the ordinary prismatic spectrum (Fig. 7,
1). The last sentence in chap. 19, referring to this
diagram, is badly translated, and certainly ought to be
amended, for as it stands at present it is unintelligible.
We have said enough to show that Prof. Lommel's
treatise is a useful contribution to the International Series,
and is a book that can thoroughly be understood and
enjoyed by any intelligent reader who may not have had
any special scientific training. The familiar chromo-
lithograph of different spectra which adorns the title-page
of the volume has by this time lost its novelty and
become wearisome. No book on chemistry, astronomy
or physics seems to be issued without it. Though the
spectroscope is a wonderful and powerful instrument, yet
the promincnee of this subject is a little apt to throw
equally valuable instruments into the background.

treatise on the habits of climbing plants, published

in 1865 in the ninth volume of the "Journal of the
Linnean Society," with such additions and corrections as
the progress of knowledge since that time has rendered
necessary. Although the subject had been investigated
previously to that time by the German physiologists
Palm and Von Mohl, it was Mr. Darwin's publication,
describing many facts not previously recorded, that first
introduced the remarkable phenomena connected with it
to the notice of the general public. The phrase Climbing
Plant is used by Mr. Darwin as a generic term for all
those which, provided themselves with but weak stems
that have no power of standing erect, avail them-
selves of the assistance of.neighbouring plants for the
purpose of raising their foliage and flowers to a consider-
able height from the ground. The plants included under
this head are arranged in four divisions, according to the
part that is modified in order to subserve this purpose:
(1) Twining Plants (called in the first edition Spiral
Twiners), in which the stem is the climbing organ; (2)
Leaf-climbers, which climb by the aid of the petiole or
some other portion of the leaf; (3) Tendril-bearers, by

conceding this view with regard to all the other causes of |
movement, Mr. Darwin finds a difficulty in accepting it
as regards movement caused by curvature from a touch,
or what is ordinarily called sensitiveness. On this point
he remarks that the movement of Revolving Nutation
(Sachs's term for "the continuous self-bowing of a whole
shoot successively to all points of the compass ") differs
from that due to touch, in so far that in some cases the
two powers are acquired by the same tendril at different
periods of growth ; and the sensitive part of the tendril
does not seem capable of nutation. A more important
cause of hesitation is the extraordinary rapidity of the
movement. Mr. Darwin has seen the extremity of a
tendril of Passiftora gracilis, after being touched, dis-
tinctly bend in twenty-five seconds, and often in thirty
seconds ; and he doubts whether it is possible to believe
in* such rapidity of growth as would account for such
movement. In reference to this wc may simply remark
that instances are on record of extraordinarily rapid
growth—as in the case of the flower-stalk of Vallisturia
to the extent of half an inch in an hour or more—even

the stations are a valuable piece of work, and the dis-
cussion of the results three or four years hence will be
looked forward to with much interest by meteorologists.
An admirable feature of these reports are the averages,
corrected up to date in all instances, which are given
with the discussion of each meteorological element, thus
affording the means of an immediate comparison of the
monthl/results with the best averages that can possibly
be had. Of these averages and comparisons we would
direct special attention to those of the rainfall, which is
of so great importance in Indian meteorology. Rainfall
averages for different pcrioJs were prepared during the
past year for the information o( the Government ol India.
These have since been further amplified and corrected,
and the present report gives the average monthly and
ai nual rainfall for 146 stations, and incomplete averages'
for some months for other twenty-three stations. An j
example of the practical application of the rainfall dis-
cussions of the Office is gisen in the report. A forecast

of the lava currents of Auvergne. M. Lecoq had in his museum
some fossil remains of the Marmot, the Mammoth, and the
tichorhine Rhinoceros, and he distinctly told us that these relics
of northern mammalia, which geologists are accustomed to
associate with glacial times, were mostly found in cracks and
fissures in the lava-streams near Clermont Ferrand. From this
it would appear that the latest lava streams of Auvergne had be-
come cold, consolidated, and fissured before the introduction of
the bones and teeth of the northern quadrupeds into the fissures.
But if this prove to be true, on further investigation, I do not
wish to imply that there have been no volcanic eruptions in
Central France since the last outpour of lava currents, or the
days of the Mammoth. On the contrary, I think the evidence
is the other way. I have just returned from a visit to the extinct
volcanos of the Haute Loire and the Ardeche, where I was
accompanied by my friends Sir William Guise, Capt. Price, and
Mr. Lucy; and I believe there is evidence of a certain amount
of volcanic action in the Ardeche since the outpouring of the
later lava-streams. There are outbuists of volcanic ash and
scoriae which form what are termed "chimneys," and which are
blown right through the most recent lava-currents. Both near

Montpezat, so admirably depicted by Mr. Scrope, and near the
bridge at La Beaume, there are outbursts and eruptions through
the basalts, which dislocate and throw off the basaltic columns.
It is not improbable that some of these attempts at forming a
volcano happened in the Ardeche during the fifth century, when
the Archbishop of Vienne, Alcimus Avitus, in his homily on the
"Rogation Days," speaks of "frequent shocks of earthquakes,"
and "fires often blazing," and " piled up mounds of ashes."
Gregory of Tours also speaks of stags and wolves wandering
about Vienne. These wild animals may have been driven from
the forests of the Ardeche, by these last volcanic eruptions, as far
as Vienne. W. S. Symonds
Communication of Information among Bees
Some two or three years ago a swarm of bees entered a very
small hole under the slates near the eaves of the roof of my
house in the Highlands, and established themselves for the sum-
mer but died out in the subsequent winter. I inter that there
were no survivors among the bees to remember the circumstance
(see Appendix to Kirby and Spence's "Entomology") and to
account in any degree for what occurred this summer.
The house is of four stories, and stands in the garden, in which,
al out fiity yards from the house, on the other side of a hedge, are
my beehives. For a few days, during which there were the usual
indications of swarming being imminent in one of the hives, a great
many bees found their way into the lower rooms of the house; there

was a constant hum ol bees in one of the chimneys, at the top of
which there was always a group flying about. The top of this
chimney is about thirty feet horizontally from the settlement of
the old swarm, and fifteen feet above it; there was also occa-
sionally a cluster of bees on the roof of a "semi-detached"
lower building (the kitchen) on the other side of the house from
the old settlement, but as far as -we saw no bees visited the old
settlement, and nothing indicated any intention of the swarm to
go there, though we expecttd it to make for the house and pro-
bably for the chimney I have mentioned. In due time the
swarm came off and rose unusually high, and I immediately
made some smoke in the chimney to prevent their entering it.
Presently the swarm settled on a low apple-tree and was snugly
hived in the usual way in a straw "skep" about noon. Next
day, however, about 10 a.m., the swarm left its "skep" and
made for the old settlement without any hesitation, and there
they established themselves in spite of all we could do.
Of course the whole proceedings may have been disconnected,
but the impression left on my mind was that the queen, or her
counsellors, had previously "prospected," and resolved to go to
the old settlement as an eligible " location," and that the common

expected an unusual tide." Allow me to state, sir, that in the
Spectator of Nov. 7th, 1874, I predicted this extraordinary tide.
As a matter of fact, the tide was higher than that of March
1874, through the unusually swollen state of the river by floods
and the N.W. gale.
No extraordinary tide can occur this side of March 1S78.

A Criminal Dog
I was so much pleased with the anecdote in Nature (vol.
xiii. p. 36) of the criminal dog who buried the cat he had
murdered, that I told my wife ; but I did not mention the breed
of the dog.
She said, " Was it not a retriever? because they always bury
their food, so that it mav become high." I could but answer
that it was a retriever, and added that I was afraid she had hit
npon the real reason for the act. R. S. CULLEY

Dr. Doberck makes no reference to Sir W. Herschel's

less than 30 in advance of his measure 1781, August 17.
when the companion was first detected. The measure of
1802 was registered s.p. and "corrected by a subsequent
observation to n.f.," as Sir John Herschel states in
Memoirs R.A.S. vol. v. p. 46; but it is now pretty evident,
from a projection of all the measures to 1875, that the
quadrant was correctly registered s.p., and consequently
the angle for 1802246 should be 2070 1' according to our
ptesent method of reckoning. The angle calculated for
this time from the above orbit is 2060 55', and this close
agreement must be taken as very satisfactory evidence
that Dr. Doberck has given us something like the true
orbit, notwithstanding the difficulty of the case. It had
been surmised that Sir W. Herschel's measures were

in the result. The light was perceptible for a short time
last Sunday evening, without any yellowish tinge, and the
position of axis somewhat doubtful from the indifferent
state of the sky. Prof. Heis's observations in December

the equator in R.A. 3490, or with about 820 elongation

THE RAINFALL
THE extraordinary rainfall of the past year will make
1875 memorable in the annals of meteorology. With
scarcely an exception every part of Great Britain has
suffered from a plague of rain; from the Continent and
from North America there come the same tidings of in-
cessant rain and vast inundations. Even in a country so
far distant as China we hear of unprecedented rains.
The following statistics concerning a rainfall that occurred
in China between last August 31st and September 1st
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
will be read with astonishment. Our information is
derived from the bulletins of the Meteorological Obser-
vatory of the Fathers of the Society of Jesus at Sikawei,
on whose accuracy of observation we may doubtless
depend. The readings show that between four and seven
o'clock in the morning of September 1st the mean rain-
fall per hour was 327 millimetres, which makes the
astonishing rate of i-287 inch for each of those three
hours. Well may the compiler remark, "We think
there are few examples of such a figure, except in the
case of waterspouts."
The total quantity that fell in the garden of the Jesuit
Observatory during the twenty-four hours that elapsed
between four o'clock on Tuesday, 31st August, and the
same hour in the afternoon of Wednesday, 1st September,
was 218 millimetres, or no less than 8-59 inches for the
rainfall of a single day! After this the records of rainfall
in Great Britain look insignificant. Nevertheless the fall
has f.ir exceeded the ordinary statistics. At Balbriggan,
a town a few miles north of Dublin, the rainfall from
9 A.M. on the 13th inst. to 9 a.m. on the 14th inst. was
two inches. This is the greatest fall in twenty-four
hours which occurred in that town for the last ten years.

hemisphere. It is probable a vast drought must some-

THE WORK OF THE CHALLENGER'1'
THIS report is dated from Hilo Hawaii, August 18,
and describes the cruise of the Challenger from Yo-
kohama to the Sandwich Islands. The Challenger left
Yokohama on the 16th of June, and ran an easterly course
between the parallels of 350 and 400 north latitude, as far
as the meridians of 155° east. She then turned nearly
directly southwards and reached Honolulu on the 27th of
July. Twenty-four observing stations were established, at
each of which most of the desired observations were made.
On the 17th of June, Prof. Thomson's Report goes on,
we sounded in 1,875 fathoms with a bottom of bluish-grey
clay and a bottom-temperature of i°7 C, forty miles to
the south-east of No Sima Lighthouse. The trawl was
put over, and it brought up a large quantity of the
bottom, which showed the clay was in a peculiar concre-
tionary state, run together into coherent lumps, which
were bored in all directions by an Annelid of the
Aphroditaccan group. In many cases the Annelids

species of Hyaloncma, which occurred in considerable
numbers and in an excellent state of preservation. The
form of the sponge-body is almost spherical, with a com-
paratively small oscular opening, and the coil is much
shorter than in H. Sieboldi, in the largest specimens not
more than six inches in length. One remarkable point
was, that in no case was there a commensal Palython con-
nected with this sponge; the coil was always perfectly
clean. The spicules of the network and of the sarcode
closely resemble those of the Japanese species, but they
all present marked specific differences in detail of form.
On the 12th of July the trawl was lowered at a depth of
2,740 fathoms. The net contained very few animals,
and was greatly torn and frayed ; but in a kind of packet
formed by an accidental folding of the net, there were
about a hundredweight of black mammillated concre-
tions, which, when they were poured out on the deck, had
very much the appearance of potatoes. The external
surface of the concretion was slightly rough, and a num-
ber of small animal forms, particularly a minute rhizopod
in a membranous tube, nestled in the crevices. The

nature of these concretions will be discussed hereafter.
On the 14th of July we reached the point lat. 380 9' N.,
long. 156° 25' W., whence we turned southwards towards
the Sandwich Islands. For the last few stations the tem-
perature of the water had been gradually sinking, and the
influence of the Japan current dying out ; the isotherm
of io0 C. was now only 100 fathoms below the surface.
On the 17th of July we sounded in 3.025 fathoms, the
bottom still " red clay ;" and on the 19th in 2,850 fathoms.
A serial sounding taken at the latter station to 1,500
fathoms showed a considerable rise in the temperatures
near the surface, the isotherm of io° C. having again sunk
to a depth of 200 fathoms, and that of 150 C. correspond-
ing with the 100-fathom line.
On the 24th, in 2,775 fathoms, the Albatrosses which
had followed the ship, to the number of from fourteen to
twenty daily since we left Japan, left us. In the evening
of the 27th, the Challenger anchored in the harbour of
Honolulu.
This cruise naturally divides itself into two parts: a
section about 3,170 nautical miles in length, including the
stations from No. 237 to No. 253, very slightly to the
northward of east, between the parallels of 350 and 38° N.
lat. ; and a meridional section of 1,128 nautical miles,
along the meridian of 155° W. long. The first of these
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
sections corresponds very closely in relative position with
the section in the Atlantic between Sandy Hook and the
Azores, and the points of resemblance and difference
between them, when fully worked out, must prove most
instructive. The two sections cross the two great deflec-
tions to the northward of the equatorial current, in the
Atlantic the Gulf-stream, and in the Pacific the "Kuro
Siwa ;" and the thermic influence of the two currents is
fairly contrasted. The influence of the Gulf-stream, if
not absolutely greater (and this is a point which it will be
somewhat difficult to determine), is at all events much
more concentrated and effective, owing to the continuity
of the coast-line of the American continent, to the way in
which the water of the equatorial current is driven into
the Gulf of Mexico and superheated there, afterwards to
be kept together and ejected in a defined stream through
the Strait of Florida, and to the absence of periodical
winds in the Atlantic. In the Pacific, on the other hand,
the main flow of the equatorial current is weakened among
the passages of the Malayan Archipelago; and although
a large part of it is directed northwards by the broken

the two basins. While in the Atlantic it seems certain
that the temperature sinks gradually, though very slightly,
for the last thousand fathoms to the bottom, it appears
that in the Pacific the minimum temperature of l°7 C. is
reached at a depth not greater than 1,400 fathoms, and
that from that depth to the bottom the temperature is the
same.
The soundings from Yokohama to Honolulu are re-
markably uniform in depth, the twenty-two soundings on
one line which are unaffected by the neighbourhood of
land giving an average of 2,858 fathoms. The nature of
the bottom is also very uniform; and, according to the
nomenclature which we have adopted, it is in each case
noted on the chart as "red clay." It is usually, however,
somewhat greyer in colour than the typical "red clay,"
and contains a large proportion of the tests of siliceous
organisms, a proportion which increases with increasing
depth, and a considerable proportion of pumice in dif-
ferent states of comminution and decomposition. The
clay contains scarcely a trace of carbonate of lime,
although the surface swarms with ooze-forming foramini-

fera. In some cases the trawl carne up half full of large
lumps of pumice, which seemed to have been drifted
about till they were water-logged, and to be softening and
becoming decomposed; these pieces of decomposing
pumice were often coated and pervaded throughout with
oxide of manganese. Over the shale area the red chy
was full of concretions, consisting mainly of peroxide of
manganese, round, oval, or mammillated and very irre-
gular, varying in size from a grain of mustard-seed to a
large potato. When these concretions ar^ broken up,
they are found to consist of concentric layers having a
radiating fibrous arrangement, and usually starting from
a nucleus consisting of some foreign body, such as a piece
of pumice, a shark's tooth, or a fragment of any organism,
as for instance in one case a piece of a Hexactinnelid
sponge, of the genus Aphrocallistes, which was preserved
as a very beautiful fossil in the centre. The concretions
appear to form losse among the soft clay; the singular
point is the amount of this manganese formation, and the
vast area which it covers.
We were particularly successful during this cruise in
getting good samples ol the fauna from great depths ; and
we found that ths fauna of the North Pacific at depths of
from 2,000 to 3,000 fathoms, although not very abundant
in species, is by no means meagre. For each of six

dredgings and trawlings at depths greater than 2,000
fathoms, we found alorig with a few fishes a fair represen-
tation of all the larger invertebrate groups; and in one
dredging, No. 253, at a depth of 3.125 fathoms, we took a
small sp&nge, a species of Cornularia, an Actinia, an
annelid in a tube, and a Bryozoon. VVc were again struck
with the wonderful uniformity of the fauna at these depths;
if not exactly the same species, very similar representa-
tives of the same genera in all parts of the world. I am

CHARLES BLACKER V1GNOLES, F.R.S.
THIS celebrated engineer died on the 17th instant at
Hythe, at the age of eighty-three years. Although
he won his fame mainly as an engineer, yet his ser-
vices to science were of considerable importance. Mr.
Vignoles was descended from an ancient French family
which had taken refuge in England after the repeal of the
Edict of Nantes. His father, Capt. Vignoles, was an
officer in the 43rd Regiment of the Line, and his mother
was a daughter of Dr. Charles Hutton, the celebrated
mathematician and professor at the Royal Military
Academy, Woolwich. When young Vignoles was only
twelve months old, his father lost his life at the storming
of Pointe-a-Pierre, Guadaloupe, when Sir Charles Grey,
the commander of the British forces, gave the former a
commission in the army. Thus his career has been an
unprecedentedly long one. His grandfather, Dr. Hutton,

undertook his education, and the pupil certainly turned
out a credit to his teacher. For a short time before the
conclusion of the great war which ended in 1815, Vignoles
served under the Duke of Wellington on the Continent,
and after visiting America about 1822, he returned to
England and threw himself enthusiastically into the
engineering profession. The railway movement was just
then gathering strength, and Vignoles was associated with
some of the earliest efforts to establish lines in this
country. After the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
Bill was thrown out of Parliament in 1824, he was, in
1825, selected by Messrs. Rennie to take charge of the
new surveys which the Liverpool Committee ordered.
From this time forward Vignoles was ever in the van of
the railway movement, and had the foresight to predict,
amid some incredulity and ridicule, to what gigantic
results it would lead. In 1826 he was employed by
Messrs. Rennie to make surveys for a line from Nine
Elms, Vauxhall, Dorking and Shoreham, to Brighton;
and in 1834 he escorted M. Thiers over the railways
which had been built under his superintendence. The
great French Minister's dictum was, "I do not think rail-
ways are suited for France." In England, in Ireland, on
the Continent, and in America, Mr. Vignoles took a
prominent part in the carrying out of great railway and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
other engineering works. Probably one of his greatest
works was the magnificent suspension bridge over the
Dnieper at Kieff, commenced in 1848 and finished in
1853, at a cost of 432,000/. A fine model of this is now
in the Crystal Palace.
Mr. Vignoles became a member of the Institution of
Civil Engineers in 1827, and was elected President in
1870, when he gave a very able address on the progress
of engineering. In 1842 he gave a series of remarkable
lectures as Professor of Civil Engineering at London
University College. In 1855 he was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society; he was also a Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society, and was for long a regular atten-
dant at its meetings. The Eclipse party of i860 was
to a great extent indebted to him for all the local arrange-
ments, and its success was mainly due to his exertions.
He^was also Honorary Treasurer of the Expedition of
1870, was on board the Psyche when she struck, and was
afterwards indefatigable in aiding the necessary arrange-
ments. In the early part of its career he took an active
part in the meetings of the British Association, contri-

and through Behring Strait—and which have a phy-
sical connection, which is shown very distinctly in the
isothermal curves. In this undertaking the co-opera-
tion of all States having an interest in these researches
should be sought. Through the simultaneous action of
different States a circle of observing points would be
formed, which would sub-dividq a common work having
the same end in view, so that the combined labour of
several nations would entail less sacrifice to each than has
hitherto been the case. The Commission also recom-
mends the above principles for the guidance of other
nations, and thus an international alliance might be
formed through which the highest scientific results would
be attained. The Commission points out that one imme-
diate result of the Second German Expedition is that the
region between the west coast of Greenland and the east
coast of Spitzbergen would be a suitable field for German
research. As we have already stated (Nature, vol. xiii.,
p. 33), they recommend a principal station to be estab-

stations on Jan Mayen Island and the west coast of
Spitzbergen.
In the region indicated for observation, which can easily
be reached from Central Europe, and whose exploration
has for European States the greatest scientific and
practical interest, German explorers have made a happy
commencement, and established a claim for Germany to
continue the work thus begun. The Commission urge
Germany to set abou' at once fitting out an expedition
for the occupation of the above region. They believe that
if diligent preparations were made, the expedition might
be ready to start in 1877. Finally, they recommend the
appointment of a Scientific Commission to draw up full
instructions for the guidance of the expedition in all de
partments.

from Baku to Krassnowadsk, thence to the Balchan Bay

Dredging was carried on up to a depth of 150 fathoms,

SCIENCE IN GERMANY
{From a German Correspondent.)
IN the twenty- fifth volume of the " Zeitschrift fur Wissen-
schaftliche Zoologie," just completed, Ehlers has given
some interesting conclusions with respect to the distribu-
tion of the Chastopoda which were collected during the
Porcupine expedition, by Messrs. Carpenter, Wyville
Thomson, and Gwyn Jeffreys (" Beitragezur Kentniss der
vertical Verbreitung der Borstenwiirmer im Meere "). He
finds, in the first place, that of all Chaetopoda occurring
on the European coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean,
only two families show representatives in the greater sea-
depths at more than 300 fathoms, and he thinks, there-
fore, it is not certain that any forms belong exclusively
to the deep sea. Further, the conditions of temperature
of the water, as they determine the horizontal distribution
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of Chaetopoda, seem also to be of influence with regard
to their vertical distribution, seeing the deeper layers of
water are also the colder. Accordingly the forms that
live in the cold deep sea of that zone of the Atlantic Ocean
correspond with those of the coast fauna of the Arctic
regions; and Ehlers thinks that they might even have a
direct connection through currents which descend from
the Arctic regions to the depths of warmer marine zones.
It is also conceivable that the deep-sea forms, at a time
when those regions of the Atlantic were warmer than they
are now, were frequenters of the coast, and in proportion
as the Gulf Stream heated the upper layers, they retired
into the depths. For the most part they remain inferior
to their Arctic congeners, perhaps because the conditions
of existence in the depths are less favourable, and partly,
doubtless, on account of the lack of plant life, and also
the small amount of animal nutriment for the worms,
there provided. Though in the greater sea depths the
light is quite excluded, yet in the Chaetopoda found
there (with some rare exceptions) we miss neither the
colouis nor the eyes, which are met with in coast re-
gions. Ehlers believes that these colours and eyes are
preserved in the lightless depths, in consequence of new
animals ever migrating down from the brighter layers of
water, and so preventing the disappearance of these body-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
parts. There is, however, in the same "Zeitschrift" which
contains Ehlers' work, a paper by the physiologist Ranke,
on the eyes of leeches (litrudo medicinalis), which may
explain that phenomenon in the deep-sea Chaetopoda in
a different way (" Beitrage zur Lehre von der Uebergangs-
Sinnes-Organen "). Ranke, on the ground of his obser-
vations on living leeches, considers that their very simply
constructed eyes have also sensations of touch and taste;
and, further, that they are not eyes proper, which, on
occasion, also serve other ends; they are, rather, neutral
organs of sense, which can act in various directions, but in
no particular one so specially as sense organs more highly
organised, and therefore limited to one specific energy.
This appears partly from the fact that organs quite similar
to these so-called eyes on the head of the leech occur also
in the whole of the rest of its body, quite in the same
way as the so-called side organs of fishes and amphibia,
which probably afford sensations of touch. We might,
then, regard the eyes of the deep-sea Chaetopoda as simi-
lar indifferent organs of sense, which, even where light
fails, do not discontinue their functions. In an appendix

On the 28th a start was again made, and a number of immense

which is all the more interesting, as it has been stated that the

SCIENTIFIC SERIALS
THE 'Journal of the Chemical Society for October contains but
one paper communicated to the Society, viz., a lengthy commu-
nication on the chemistry of tartaric and citric acids, by Mr. R.
Warington. The author has had considerable experience in the
manufacture of these acids, having been for some years chemist
to the factory of Mr. J. B. Lawes. The author's experiments
prove that the citric acid of commerce contains one molecule of
water corresponding to the formula C6Hs07, HaO. Some inte-
resting results have been brought to light in the course of some
experiments made with a view to determine the water of crys-
tallisation in various samples of the acid. Thus in one deter-
mination a specimen of the powdered acid lost the whole of its
water over sulphuric acid in a few days, at a temperature of 16°.
In another experiment the powdered acid lost but a mere trace
of water in vacuo over vittiol for some days, while the same
acid heated to 100° lost its normal amount of water. Results
of an equally contradictory nature were obtained with various
other samples of the acid tried at subsequent periods. It has been
proved also that a strong solution of citric acid undergoes con-
siderable contraction when mixed with water.—The next section

of the paper relates to the acidity and commercial value of the
different lime, lemon, and bergamot juices supplied for the
manufacture of citric acid. The nature of some of the acids
existing in the concentrated juices is to be made the subject of
further research; up to the present time, in addition to citric,
formic, acetic, and possibly propionic, acids have been detected.
It appears, however, that the organic acids other than citric
which exist in the juice are chiefly non-volatile, and have soluble
calcium salts. Phosphoric acid has also been found, and there
is reason to suspect malic and aconitic acids, the latter being
produced by the concentration of the juice. With regard to
calcium citrate, it has been found that the amount of water con-
tained in this salt varies according to the mode of preparation, a
result demanding further investigation. The author next gives
details of the method employed for analysing the citric acid liquors.
With regard to tartaric acid, it is found that a strong solution
contracts even more than citric acid when mixed with water.
The author then proceeds to consider the qualitative reactions of
tartaric, metatartaric, and ditartaric acids. Contrary to the state-
ment given in books, it has been found that calcium acetate yields
a crystalline precipitate of calcium tartrate, even in dilute solu-
tions of tartaric acid. Free tartaric acid also is precipitated by
calcium chloride in the presence of alcohol. The reactions with
the acetates of lead and barium have likewise been studied.
With regard to the amount of water in calcium tartrate, the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
author concludes that the salt has no definite composition at 100°.
A very complete series of experiments upon the solubility of
potassium bitartrate has been made, and the remainder of the
paper is devoted to the materials used lor the manufacture of
tartaric acid, viz. lees, argol, and tartar, and the methods of
analysis employed in their valuation. Mr. Warington deserves
credit for thus contributing to the general store of knowledge
from the experience gained in the chemical factor)*. A great
deal of manufacturing chemistry is at present carried on without
any regard to the scientific principles involved, and if manufac-
turers would only be somewhat more free in communicating
apparently inexplicable facts to the scientific world, the advan-
tage gained could not but be mutually beneficial. To quote the
author's own words :—" A large amount of information is
acquired in the laboratories of our gieat manufacturing concerns;
most of this mifjht be published without any injury to the indi-
vidual manufacturer. Especially is this true of analytical
methods, and the publication and discussion of these would do
much to remove the disgrace to which science is often subjected

with a form of table for combining the correction), for index-error,
temperature, and altitude, by William Marriott. Readings of
the barometer to be of any scientific value must be corrected for
index error, terapetature, and height above mean sea-level.
There is not much difficulty in applying the first two, but it is a
very troublesome thing to obtain the proper corrections for alti-
tude if the station be more than 100 leet above sea-level. The
author has found that a great number of observers make some
very extraordinary mistakes in applying this correction, and
gives a lew as specimens. He attributes the difficulty in apply-
ing this correction to the unsatisfactory explanation accompanying
the tables as given in the different manuals on meteorology and
to the fact of the corrections being only given for two pressures,
viz., 27 inches and 30 inches. He then submits a table which
gives the sea-level pressure on the left hand and the reading of
the barometer at the station corresponding to that pressure on
the right hand, with the altitude correction between them. In
conclusion he submits a form of table in which is combined the
corrections for index-error, temperature, and height above sea-
level, which is the means of saving much time, besides reducing
the liability to error.—On a continuous self-registering thermo-

coil is moved slightly away from the others, so that it shall form

being the axis around which the spiral tube is coiled. Pivots
are attached to either end of the axis, which rest on two parallel
metal uprights. The tubing is filled with spirit, and mercury
and a small quantity of air are enclosed in the large coil. The
thermometer works in the following manner : when the spirit
contracts on cooling, the expansion of the included air keeps the
column of mercury in contact with it; this immediately alters
the centre of gravity, and the wheel begins to revolve in a direc-
tion opposite to that of the receding mercury. On applying
heat, the mercury passes forwards and the wheel moves in the
opposite direction. The thermometer is made to record some-
what in the same way as the recording aneroid barometer.—On

Food Manufacture versus River Pollution. A Letter
addressed to the Newspaper Press of England, by the
same Author. (London : Stanford, 1875.)
THE question of River Pollution, one of undoubted
importance to the country at large, has been once
again raised by Mr. Hope, so well known for his untiring
zeal in the cause of sewage farming, in the two above-
named pamphlets. As involving questions of science—
or at ltast of applied science—we feel called upon to
offer some remarks upon the subject, the more so as it is
one having such unquestionable sanitary bearings as to
have been made the subject of Select Committees, Royal
Commissions, and of at least three Parliamentary Bills.
We shall in the first place give a brief abstract of Mr.
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
Hope's pamphlets, in order to lay before our readers the
present state of the sewage question, before proceeding
to consider the manner in which the subject has been
handled by the Legislature.
In the first-named pamphlet the author passes in review
the chief processes which have been proposed for pre-
venting the pollution of rivers by sewage, classifying all
systems under two divisions—"those which profess to deal
with part only of the sewage, and those which profess to
deal with the whole." The inefficacy of the former is
summed up in the following words (page 5):—
"But supposing that they really accomplished all they
are intended to effect, the sewage question would still be
as far from solution as ever, for the part of the total refuse
which they profess to deal with is only about a half per
cent, or the whole."
Of processes professing to deal with the whole of the
sewage the first noticed are those precipitation schemes
in which the sewage matter is supposed to be precipitated
by the addition of some chemical substance. The so-
called "ABC" process is considered at some length, and
its not very creditable history traced; analyses of the
various precipitating mixtures employed by this company
are given, beginning with that first employed which the
author distinguishes as " Moses " (because stated by the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
patentee to have been first revealed to Moses in the wil-
derness and communicated by him to the children of
Israel.'), and concluding with that in use at Leeds at the
time of reading the paper.
When we state that this mixture consists of alum,
blood, clay, and charcoal refuse from Prussian blue
works, our readers will at once perceive the justice of the
sentence pronounced by Mr. Hope—that none of the
ammonia in solution is precipitated, but runs away in the
effluent water. We may furthermore recall to mind the
fact that the process as carried on at Leicester and
Leamington, with a mixture containing the same ingre-
dients in different proportions, was made the subject of
an exhaustive inquiry by the Rivers Pollution Commis-
Vol. xiii.—No. 31S
sion, and justly condemned by that body in their second
Report, on the grounds of its failing to remove the organic
polluting substances in the state of solution. The same
objections are applicable to Forbes' phosphate of alumina
process, and to Anderson's process, which are the next
considered. Mr. Whitthread's phosphate of calcium pro-

upon the assumption of his receiving the sewage from a
population of 8,000, instead of which the amount actually
received was that due to a population of about 3,000.
Mr. Hope has thus done excellent service in continually
directing attention to and practically demonstrating, often
at great pecuniary sacrifice, the applicability of the irriga-
tion scheme to the disposal of sewage. It is true that the
Towns Sewage Commission of 1865, in their third Report,
did not speak favourably of the process, stating that their
analyses proved that the effluent water from the Rugby
works contained about the same quantity of dissolved
organic impurity as the raw sewage, but it is now known
that the process of analysis employed by them gave fal-
lacious results, and analyses by the Rivers Commission
(First Report) show that the process removes an average
of 817 per cent, of the nitrogen, and 68'6 per cent, of the
carbon contained as dissolved organic impurity, and 977
per cent, of the suspended organic pollution.
So much for irrigation. The other plan recommended
by the Commission, Frankland's "downward inter-
mittent filtration," is equally if not more effective. An
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
average of 87-6 per cent, of nitrogen and 72'8 per cent
of carbon contained as dissolved organic pollution is
removed by the operation, and all suspended impurities.
We may further state that the plan has been applied by
Mr. Bailey Denton to the sewage of Merthyr Tydvil, and
has been in successful operation at that town for a
period of three years.
Two effective schemes for the treatment of sewage—
either of which might be employed according to the
locality—are thus offered, so that, the sewage question
being practically settled, let us now consider the action
of the Government in the matter.
It is at least fifteen years since the efficacy of irri-
gation was first made known, and seven years since the dis-
covery of intermittent filtration. In a letter on the sewage
question published in 1865 by Mr. Hope, it is stated that
"there have already been six Select Committees and two
Royal Commissions on the question, independently of the
Main Drainage Committee of the Metropolitan Board of
Works, which has investigated the subject for five long
years, and these Committees and Commissions have pub-
lished no less than ten reports." A Rivers Pollution Com-
mission was formed in 1865 and replaced by another in 1868,
which continued its work down to i874.;These Commissions
have cost the country from 40,000/. to 50,000/., and in their

laboratory the various processes devised for the purification
of sewage and other foul liquids have been quantitatively
examined and the results made known in no less than
nine consecutive reports. Remedies for the different
forms of pollution have been clearly and consistently
pointed out, and various recommendations suggested for
legislation. The standards of polluting liquids proposed
by the Commission to be fixed by Act of Parliament
have been substantially approved of both by English and
Continental chemists of eminence. Now the members of
a Royal Commission are presumably appointed because
specialy qualified for the inquiry, a presumption which
has been amply testified in the case of the Rivers Com-
mission. Notwithstanding this—notwithstanding that a
code of standards has been proposed for legislative enact-
ment—in spite of the fact that practical and efficient
remedies do already exist for the [disposal of sewage,
down to the present time nothing whatever has been
done by the Government. The Duke of North-
umberland's Bill of 1873 embodied, it is true, all the
recommendations of the Rivers Commission, but, most

and we cannot but think it is an unwise thing to establish
the idea that fustian can have for a penny what is charged
sixpence or a shilling to cloth. If a penny entrance-fee
is too firmly rooted to be dislodged with impunity, boxes
might be put in the room for contributions by the
audience, who might be urged to make the lectures self-
supporting. Moreover, the profits on the sale of these
reports of the lectures must be large and ought to go
some way towards meeting the expense of the lectures
themselves. After all, the main secret of success in any
popular lecture scheme is to have some one responsible
person, like Prof. Roscoe, who, year after year, has
unsparingly used his influence and his time in this good
cause.

We must add a few words about the books before us.
When upon opening our parcel we found the editor of
Natuee had sent us these lectures with a request for a
review of them, we felt he had set us to a hopeless task.
What sane solitary reviewer dare venture to criticise
the collective wisdom of Professors Huxley, Tyndall, Ros-
coe, Gladstone, Geikie, Balfour Stewart, Odling, Clifford,
W. C. Williamson, Wilkins, Ward, Jevons, Drs. Car-
penter and Huggins, Mr. Spottiswoode, Sir John Lubbock,
and other famous men who make up the brilliant array of
Manchester lecturers?
It is hardly needful to say that all the'lectures in
these volumes are good, and some well repay care-
ful perusal. Many of the lectures are so fascinating
that it is difficult to put the volumes aside. What, for
instance, can be more charming than Prof. Geikie's
lecture on the Ice Age in Great Britain, or Sir John
Lubbock's lecture on Modern Savages, or Prof. Stewart's
on the Sun and Earth? And we envy those who were
present at such experimental lectures as Prof. Tyndall's
on Crystalline Forces, Prof. Abel's on Gun Cotton, or at
Prof. Roscoe's or Dr. Huggins', and others we have not
space to name. The books before us are therefore well
worth preserving, for though the lectures are popular they
are in no instance claptrap ; and whilst within the com-

prehension of all classes, they will also be found not un-
worthy of perusal by men of culture.
Mr. Pitman, who reported the lectures, has evidently
done his work faithfully and well, and Mr. Heywood who
publishes them has clothed the volumes in a new and
attractive dress.
We would venture, however, to suggest to Prof.
Roscoe—whose name at the foot of each preface is the
only editorial mark — that it would be desirable to have
a responsible editor when such permanence, as these
volumes indicate, is given to the lectures. Reading one
of Dr. Carpenter's lectures, for example, there is a con-
tinual reference to diagrams and maps which, though
present to the audience, are not so to the reader; and
to some other lectures the same remark applies. Moreover,
before binding up the lectures, the authors, we think,
ought to have been informed that a volume was to be
issued, and so the opportunity afforded them of making
any corrections or additions to their lectures they might
find necessary. Then a better table of contents of each
volume would be an advantage, and the names of the

object is concerned, though he brought back much
valuable information concerning the country traversed.
The latter portion was over comparatively unknown
ground ; and Mr. Forrest discovered a remarkable series
of salt lakes extending from about 119° to 122° E. long.,
and between 280 and 29° S. lat. The country is some-
what hilly along the 29th parallel, with granite and sand-
stone rocks. Here he was on the edge of the dreary
spinifex desert which has daunted so many explorers.
Mr. Forrest's second journey was n much more im-
portant and extensive as well as hazardous one; it was
indeed along the same route as that in which the daunt-
less Eyre suffered so terribly thirty-five years ago. With
a small party, and after making excellent arrangements
with a vessel to meet them at a certain point, he set out
from Perth on March 30, 1870, came S.E. to the coast,
.-nd travelled along the great Australian Bight, reaching
Adelaide on Aug. 24, without loss. He kept considerably
more inland than did Eyre, and was in every respect more
fortunate, though there^was frequently considerable suffer-
ing from want of water. His report of the country tra-

versed is much more favourable than Eyre's ; large grassy
tracts, extending many miles inland, being found along
nearly the whole length of the Bight. Water is the great
want, yet, since Forrest's journey, settlers have been
attracted to the region, and we believe preparations are
being made to connect West Australia with the eastern
colonies by means of the telegraph.
Mr. Forrest's third journey was a much more formidable
undertaking, and in all respects of more importance than
either of the two previous ones. Its object was to discover
decisively the real nature of the mysterious interior, and
thus make an important contribution to scientific know-
ledge, as well as to let the Australians know what are
the resources of their immense continent, not much less
in area than continental Europe. The expedition was
carefully organised, though it did not cost much above
600/., and consisted of four white men, two blacks, and a
1 irge number of horses to carry provisions, equipment,
&c, as well as for riding. The party set out from Perth
0.1 March 18, 1874, and after reaching 260 S. lat. in
1170 E. long., proceeded in a generally eastward direction
along that parallel, until on Sept. 27 the telegraph line
was struck in 27° 7' 50" S. lat. Mr. Forrest's route was
thus on an average about 400 miles S. of that of Colonel
Warburton. After the first few entries in his journal,

Mr. Forrest's narrative becomes somewhat tedious from
its sameness, though the intelligent and energetic leader
is not to blame for this. As has been the case with
nearly all previous inland Australian expeditions, the
daily occupation of the present one was to hunt for
water; this is the burthen of every day's entry in the
journal. Mr. Forrest has the same tale to tell as Colonel
Warburton had of the more northerly route—apparently
endless spinifex plains, varied with sand-hills, sandstone
cliffs, granite rocks, a few trees, and, in Forrest's case,
with rare grassy plains, but with scarcely enough of
water all the way to fill a fair-sized mill-pond. Forrest's
party, however, notwithstanding that they had no camels,
fared much better, both in the matter of food and drink,
than did Warburton's; only one of the horses actually
died, and comparatively few had to be abandoned. Once
only were they attacked by the natives, who were dis-
persed by a shot or two that did little damage. Not
many natives were met with, though signs of them were
frequently seen, and they seem to have been watching the
expedition along most of the route.

Official Guide-book to the Manchester Aquarium. By the
Curator, W. Saville Kent, F.L.S., F.ZS. Third edition.
Twentieth thousand. (Michaelmas, 1875.)
The Manchester Aquarium, situated in the Alexandra
Park of that city, has now been opened to the public for
more than two years, and has attained considerable
success, although we believe it has not quite realised the
expectations formed of it by its original promoters. Next
to the Brighton Aquarium, that of Manchester is the
largest amongst the six principal institutions of this kind
existing in the country. The series of tanks, including the
deep sea, shallow, and fresh-water groups, is sixty-eight
in number, surpassing that of any other aquarium, while

their linear frontage falls little short of 700 feet, which is
but slightly less than that of the well-known establishment
at Brighton. The building itself is of the plainest possible
design, and at first sight seems as if it had been oiigi-
nally destined for a church of some kind. It consists of
a high central oblong nave and two narrow side aisles.
Being lofty and well lighted, however, it affords excellent
accommodation for the smallertanks which line it on both
sides.as well as for the two fine large tanks, upwards of forty
feet in length, which are situated at the two extremities.
The proprietors of the Manchester Institution have been
moreover fortunate in securing the services of a com-
petent scientific naturalist as its director, an advantage
shared by few if any of the sister establishments. Mr.
W. Saville Kent transferred his services from Brighton to
Manchester some two years ago. One of the last things he
did at Brighton was to prepare the excellent Handbook to
the Aquarium there which has been already noticed in this
journal. We have now before us a copy of the third edition
of the same author's "Guide-book to the Manchester Aqua-
rium," prepared somewhat after the same fashion. After
a few words of introduction describing the building and
the general management, the sixty-eight tanks and their
contents are discussed successively. A large amount of in-
formation upon the various fishes and other animals which

they contain is thrown together in a very popular and read-
able form, and woodcuts are introduced illustrating the
more attractive and noticeable objects exhibited. The
Guide-book is concluded by a chapter on the principles of
management of aquaria generally, which cannot fail to be
of service to tho^c who are interested in such matters, and
which proves that Mr. Kent is fully master of the subject
of which he treats.

An unfavourable impression of this little book is created at

a plagiarism may generally be taken as a confession on

NATURE
Sachs's "Text-book of Botany," by Prof. E. R. Lankester, the
Savilian Professor is also spoken of as having "discovered the
sexuality of plants." It would interest students of the history
of botany to know to what extent the writer of either of these
articles is able to corroborate this statement by reference to Sir
Thomas Millington's writings. In his recently published "His-
tory of Botany," Prof. Sachs gives the following account of this
alleged discovery :—"In all histories relating to the subject of
sexuality, a certain Sir Thomas Millington—otherwise unknown
in the history of botany—is mentioned as deserving of the credit
of having first indicated the stamens as the male sexual organs.
The only information, however, which we have in support of this
is contained in the following statement by Grew in his 'Anatomy
of Plants,' 1682, p. 171, ch. 5, § 3 :—' In conversation on this
subject'—viz., on the part played by the stamens (termed by
Grew the 'attire ') in the formation of seeds—' with our
learned Savilian Professor, Sir Thomas Millington, he gave it
as his opinion that the 'attire' serves as the male organ for the
production of the seed. I at once replied that I was of the
same opinion, gave him some reasons for it, and answered some
objections which might be made to it.'" * In the first edition of

Crew's work, 1671, he attributes no sexual function to the
stamens; but in the edition of 1681 he thus continues, in sub-
stance:—It appears firstly, that the "attire" serves to separate
certain superfluous portions of the sap in order to prepare for the
production of the seed. Just as the foliature (floral leaves)
serves to carry away the volatile saline particles of sulphur, so
the "attire " serves to diminish and adjust the atmospheric por-
tions, in order that the seed may become more oily and its
principles better fixed. The flowers have therefore usually a
more powerful odour than the "attire," because the saline is
stronger than the atmospheric sulphur, which is too subtle to
affect the senses. An analogy drawn from the animal kingdom
follows, which is hardly quotable; but Sachs points out how
wonderfully any germ of truth in Grew's hypothesis was cor-
rupted by the chemical theories and strivings alter a false analogy
of the day. It is difficult to see that there was really any
advance in this hypothesis upon the state of knowledge in the
time of Theophrastus (B.C. 371-286), who distinctly recognised
some individual plants as male, others as female. Whatever
merit also is due to Millington must, unless there is other record
of his services, be at least equally shared with Grew.t It does
not appear, however, that either of these botanists even attempted
to confirm their conclusions by experiment. The merit of the
first discovery of the true function of the stamens is assigned by
Prof. Sachs to the German botanist Camerarius, in his "De

my absence. Mr. Proctor, and a writer signing himself "A
Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society," comment in these
letters on the result of the late Eclipse Expedition. It would be
better if these discussions were postponed until the results are
published by the Royal Society, but if writers who have not
heard anything beyond a few short telegrams take it upon them-
selves to enlighten the public as to the value of photographs
which they have not seen, a few remarks of one who has seen
them become necessary.

the record. It would be interesting to have this accurately stated,
and more widely published.
At Bangalore, in the Mysore Province, I once registered an
inch and a quarter in twenty minutes ; and seven and eight, and
more inches have been occasionally gauged during a heavy
twenty-four hours' fall, notably so in 1856, when disastrous floods
occurred. Somewhere about that period a most extraordinary
fall of rain occurred at Madras. 1 regret that I have not the
record by me, but I am right in saying that more than twenty-
three inches fell in twenty-four hours! and that more than seven
inches fell within six hours! This was gauged at the Madras
Observatory, and registered every hour ; the statement can there-
fore be easily corroborated by a reference to the superintendent
at that place. A coffee planter on the western Ghauts of Mysore
told me that at Hoolikul he had gauged, in August 1874, 13J
inches in one day, and 10J the next. He described it as a
sullen, intermittent, continuous downpour, the monotony of
which was very depressing. At Mahableshwar, on the same
line of Ghauts, the average fall is 240 inches, chiefly in the four
or five months, from May to September inclusive ; while at the
Cherrapoonji Hills, not very far from Calcutta, the average fall

is over 600 inches, or (say) seventeen yards of rain! My notes
are in a book that I left in India, but I am within the mark in
what has been stated above.
The meteoiology of India would furnish many startling inci-
dents. It has not hitherto been sufficiently attended to, or
recorded, and much valuable time has been allowed (like the
rainfall) to run by; but attention is now, I believe, being paid to
its systematic registry, and to the publication of accurate results.

Mysore, which I would gladly place at your disposal should you

"With regard to the method of measurement on living indi-
viduals, I will merely remark that the hand must be simply laid,
with the fingers closed together, upon a board or a piece of
paper, upon which a well-defined perpendicular line has been
drawn. With this latter the axis of the middle finger and its

metacarpal bone is made precisely to coincide. Every lateral
movement of the middle finger naturally alters also the position of
the other fingers, and every movement of the fingers upon the
metacarpal bones towards the pollex turns to the advantage of
the position of the index, while that toward the little-finger-edge
of the hand to the advantage of that of the ring-finger. The
tips of the fingers (without nails d la Chlneis) are then outlined
with a pencil, halved longitudinally ; its cut surface being applied
against them." John C. Galton

two persons were examined; in ten there was similarity between
the hands as regards the relative lengths of the two fingers in

has come to an untimely end, and will no doubt regret
still more that it has done so amid much unpleasant feeling
between those chiefly concerned. We shall endeavour to
state fairly the facts of the case.
Mr. Anderson, who is a wealthy merchant, made a gift
of Penikese Island and 50,000 dollars in cash to the late
Prof. Agassiz, in order to enable him to start a school for
the practical teaching of natural history. This sum, it
may well be believed, was only sufficient to start the
school, erect buildings, furnish apparatus, and other neces-
saries. No one can complain that Mr. Anderson did not
also endow the school, and during the life-time of the
elder Agassiz there seems to have been no difficulty as to
funds. On his death,his son, Mr. Alexander Agassiz, under-
took to carry on the school. This he did, we believe, very
unwillingly, as he knew there were no funds available for
the daily business of the school, and he did not consider
the island a suitable location for such an institution unless
largely endowed. Moreover, it was his father's earnest
wish that he should devote most of his time and energy
to the Museum at Cambridge. However, he consented
to conduct the school on condition that Mr. Anderson
would contribute the sum of 10,000 dollars towards its
support for the next three years. The first intimation of
any dissatisfaction on the generous donor's part seems to

have been made to the trustees at the end of 1874, when
he sent them 132960 dollars to pay off debts which had
been incurred, announcing at the same time that this
was the last contribution he would make. The trustees
seem, nevertheless, to have made every effort to carry on
the school. A member of Prof. Agassiz's family contri-
buted a guarantee fund of 3,000 dollars, and appeals were
made in all directions, but without anything like success.
Clearly the trustees and the teachers themselves could
not be expected to carry on the school at their own
expense, and all that they had any right to look for from
Mr. Anderson was the balance of the 10,000 dollars which
he promised; why he failed to contribute this, we are
unable to say. Had he done so, those interested in the suc-
cess of the school would have had time to set about raising
something like an endowment fund, and a fine opportunity
would have been afforded to the U.S. Government to show
their appreciation of practical scientific teachers and scien-
tific research. As it was, the only course which seemed left
to the trustees, when everything is taken into account, was
to close the school and sell off the furniture and aquaria.

These impressions are in no respect correct; the pressure at
the smallest part of the pipe is, in fact, less than that at any
other point, and vice versd.
If a fluid be flowing along a pipe which has a contraction in
it (see Fig. 12), the forward velocity of the fluid at B must be

greater than that at A, in the proportion in which the sectional
area of the pipe at B is less than that at A ; and therefore while
passing from A to B the forward velocity of the fluid is being in-
creased. This increase of velocity implies the existence of a force

acting in the direction of the motion ; that is to say, each particle
which is receiving an increase of forward velocity must have a
greater fluid pressure behind it than in front of it; for no other
condition will cause that increase of forward velocity. Hence a
particle of fluid, at each stage of its progress along the tapering
contraction, is passing from a region of higher pressure to a region
of lower pressure, so that there must be a greater pressure in the
larger part of the pipe than in the smaller, and a diminution of
pressure at each point corresponding with the diminution of
sectional area; and this difference of pressure must be such as to
supply the force necessary to establish the additional forward
velocity required at each point of the passage of the fluid through
the contraction. Consequently, differences of pressure at different
points in the pipe depend simply upon the velocities at those
points, or, in other words, on the relative sectional areas of the
pipe at those points. *
It is simple to apply the same line of reasoning to the converse
case of an enlargement. Here the velocity of the particles is
being reduced through precisely the same series of changes, but
in an opposite order. The fluid in the larger part of the pipe
moves more slowly than that in the smaller, so that, as it ad-
vances into the enlargement, its forward velocity is being checked;
and this check implies the existence of a force acting in a direc-
tion opposite to the motion of the fluid, and each particle being
thus retarded must therefore have a greater fluid pressure in front

of it than behind it; thus a particle of fluid at each stage of its
progress along a tapering enlargement of a pipe is passing from
a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. As is
well known, the force required to produce a given change of
velocity is the same, whether the change be an increase or a de-
crease. Hence, in the case of an enlargement of a pipe, as in
the case of a contraction, the changes of velocity can be satisfied
only by changes of pressure, and the law for such change of pres-
sure will be the same, mutatis mutandis.
In a pipe in which there is a contraction and a subsequent en-
largement to the same diameter as before (see Fig. 11), since
the differences of pressure at different points depend on the differ-
ences of sectional area at those points, by a law which is exactly
the same in an enlarging as in a contracting pipe, any points
which have the same sectional area will have the same pressures,

the pressures at the larger areas bting larger, and those at the
smaller areas smaller.
Precisely the same result will follow in the case of an enlarge-
ment followed by a contraction (see Fig. 13).*

NATURE
As the pressure of the perfect fluid in the pipe at any point
depends upon the sectional area at that point, it follows that the
amounts of the pressures are independent of the distance, as

measured along the pipe, in which the area of the pipe alters;
so that if in the pipe shown In Fig. 18 the areas at all the points
marked A are equal, if also the areas at all the points marked B
are equal, and so also with those at C and D, then the pressures
at all the points A will be the same, the pressures at all the
points B will be the same, and so with those at C and D.
Since, then, the pressure at each point depends on the sectional
area at the point and on that only, it is easy to see that the
variations in pressure due to the flow are not such as can cause
any total endways force on the pipe, provided its sectional area
at each end is the same.
Take the pipe shown in Fig. 19. The conical portion of pipe
A B presents the same area of surface effective for endways
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
pressure as does the conical portion H I, only in opposite
directions. They are both subject to the same pressure, being
that appropriate to their effective mean diameter J. Consequently
the endways pressures on these portions are equal and opposite
and neutralise one another. Precisely in the same way it may
be seen that the endways pressures on B C, C D, D E, exactly
counteract those on G H, F G, E F ; and in precisely the same
way it may be shown that in any combination whatever of en-
largements and contractions, provided the sectional area and
direction of the pipe at the two ends are the same, the total end-
ways effect impressed on the pipe by the fluid flowing through
it must be nil.
In the experiment I am about to show you, the several propo-
i ,,. A B
Fig. 18.
sitions which I have been elucidating will be seen to be verified
step by step, if due allowance be made for the effect of friction.
A cistem (see Fig. 20), in which a definite head of water is
maintained, discharges itself through a continuous series of pipes,
which in the local changes of diameter exhibit the several cha-
racteristic features which have been under consideration.
From a to b at the outlet end we have a contraction followed
by an enlargement; from e to g the diameter is uniform, from
h to / we have an enlargement followed by a contraction.
At the various critical features are fitted gauge-glasses such as

have been described, so that the level at which the water stands
in each indicates the pressure in the pipe at the point of attach-
ment.
The series of pipes is laid out on an [inclination which repre-
sents the mean resistance due to friction, or the "head" lost by
friction, between the cistern and the outlet, in other words, the
hydraulic mean gradient.
The mean diameter of the contracted part between a and b

has been so determined by well-known hydraulic rules, that when
it is compared with the adjoining parallel pipe, the hydraulic
gradient shall be the same in each.
You observe that while the levels at which the water stands in
the several gauge-glasses corresponds from end to end with the
gradient from the head in the cistem to the head at the outlet;
when examined in detail, they verify throughout the propositions
I have been establishing. Bnadly speaking, where the diameter
is smallest, the pressure falls most below the mean gradient; at
the points where the diameters are equal, the pressures allowing
for the gradient arc equal, and what is a quantitative verifica-
tion, the gradient, or loss of head per foot between a and b,

as indicated by the gauge-glass levels of and i', is identical with
that indicated by if' g\ the giuge-glass levels connected with
the parallel pipe.
In dealing with pipes of varying sectional area I have hitherto
treated only of the modifications caused in the forward motion
of the particles of fluid ; for I have limited the argument to cases
where the alteration in sectional area of the pipe is so gradual
that, practica'ly, the only alteration in the motion of the particles
is that in their forward velocity; but I have previously shown
that tortuosity in a pipe of uniform diameter does not introduce
endways pressure, provided the initial and terminal directions are
the same ; and it is easy to see that an elongated system of such
gradually tapered pipes as we have been considering, may be also
tortuous without introducing end ways pressure. Now tortuosity
of flow is but another word for sideways deviation of flow.
This leads us up to the case of more sudden contractions or
enlargements in pipes, where the particles next the sides of the
pipes hive to follow their surfaces and must therefore be moved
rapidly sideways in their course.
We will, for simplicity, consider the case of a contraction (see
Fig. 21), and one in which the pipe resumes the same diameter
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
beyond the contraction.
Fig. 2t.
The particles along the central line pursue a straight course,
and are subject only to the changes of pressure necessary to in-
duce the changes of velocity.
To consider the behaviour of the other particles, let us assume
that we insert a number of perfectly thin partitions (see Fig. 22),
which we lay in such a manner that they exactly follow the paths
of the particles of flu d at each point, so as not in any way to
affect their motion; these parti'ions are quite imaginary, and
merely assist us in looking upon the entire fluid in question as
divided into a number of small streams. These streams are
generally curvilinear, and vary in sectional area; and at the
point beyond the contraction where the pipe resumes its former
sectional area, we shall naturally find these minor streams occu-
pying the same sectional area as before, and moving with the
same velocity as before.
Now each of these small streams is exactly represented by a
stream of fluid flowing within a pipe, that pipe being curvilinear
and gradually varying in sectional area, and its two ends being
of the same sectional area and in the same straight line. We
have seen that in the case of such a stream, the sum total of all
the forces due to its motion has no resultant longitudinally ; and
this will be equally the case, whether the envelope of the stream
Fig. 22.
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be an actual pipe or the mutual pressure of adjacent streams;
this envelope will not be moved endways by the flow of the fluid.
What is true of each stream is true of all put together ; and thus
it follows that the whole body of fluid which these separate
streams constitute does not exert any endways force ; or, in other
words, there will be equilibrium of fluid forces throughout the
passage of the fluid through a local contraction in a pipe such as
we have been considering. The same line of argument evidently
holds gocd in the case of an enlargement, where the pipe beyond
the enlargement regains the same diameter as before.
In illustration of the conclusions which have been thus far
established, if we had a perfect fluid with which to try the
exreriment, we might exhibit a very instructive and striking
result. . .
Assume a perfect stream of fluid flowing through a pipe of
very large diameter, ABC, with a contraction in it at B, as
shown in Fig. 23. and that the equal pressures at A and Ion
either tide of the contraction are indicated by the head of fluid in
pressure-gauges A D, C E—the pressure at B, which will be less,

apparently to zero, or in reality as I have said to that of the
atmosphere.
In the apparatus as here arranged, consisting of the discharging
and the recipient cistern, with the intervening jet-orifice and
recipient-orifice, the overflow of the recipient cistern is at 18
inches above the centre of the orifices.
As I continue to fill the discharge cistern, you observe the jet
shoots across the open space between the orifices, and the water-
level continues to rise in the recipient cistern; and so long as
the head in the former is maintained at a moderate height above
that in the latter, the whole of the stream enters the recipient
orifice, and there is no waste except the small sprinkling which
is occasioned by inexactness ot aim, and by the want of exact
circularity in the orifices.
When the heid in the recipient has reached the overflow, and
thus remains at a steady height of 18 inches above the orifices, the
complete reception is insured by maintaining a head of 204 inches
in the discharging cistern, or an excess of head of l\ inches on
the discharge side; and this excess, in effect, represents the
energy wasted in friction.
You observe that as I diminish the supply of water and allow

increasing waste becomes established between the orifices; and
it is interesting to trace exactly the manner in which the friction
operates to produce this result.
I
Fig. 25.
If the conoids of discharge and reception are tolerably short as
they are here, it is the outer annule or envelopes of the stream
which are in the first instance aflected, that is to say retarded,
by friction, and the escape or waste between the orifices implies
that this surface-retardation has reduced the velocity of those
envelopes below that due to the head in the recipient; thus an
annular counter-current is able to establish itself, and in fact
constitutes a counter discharge from the recipient.
As the quantity of water which actually enters the recipient,
or in other words the speed of the inflow, is reduced, the
friction which belongs to that part of the stream is reduced also,
but that which belongs to the issuing jet is unabated, and this
circumstance virtually magnifies the waste; it is probable, how-
ever, that to the last the velocity of the central zones of the jet
remains equal to that due to the head in the discharger, and
hence you will observe that unless this is reduced below the level
of the overflow, the head in the recipient is fully maintained to
that level, though the whole quantity discharged is wasted
between the orifices.

When the supply is altogether cut off, both cisterns simul-
taneously empty themselves, the two jets meeting between the
orifices, and becoming spread into a beautiful plane disc or
film of water at right-angles to the line of discharge ; but you
will notice that from some inequality in the commencement of
the action, and to some extent probably from a quasi-instability
in the equilibrium of the double discharge, one of the jets will
presently for a moment get the better of the other and drive it
back so as almost to arrest its flow, and thus for the moment
arrest also the waste of head on that side; but the momentary
excess of head thus occasioned almost instantly asserts its supe-
riority, producing a jet of superior force, and thus driving back
for a moment the opponent by which it bad just before been
n-astered. Thus a curious oscillation of discharge ensues, which
is to a large extent a true dynamic phenomenon somewhat ana-
logous to that which becomes established in an inverted syphon
partly filled with water, if foramoment the head is increased in one
of the legs; the reaction which in the syphon is furnished by its
continuing through the bend, is, in the case before you, furnished
by the dynamic reaction of the jets, but the circumstances here
involve an instability which does not exist there, so that the

"A little south of Jewremow Kamen the eastern side of the
Jenisei is occupied by sand-banks twenty to thirty feet high, and
sloping steeply towards the river. At the river bank the tundra
commences, an endless, inconsiderably undulating plain, full of
low marshes and small shallow pools of water, and overgrown
with a sparse vegetation, whose flowering time was now almost
completely over. Instead we found at our first night quarters

taste of which, excellent in itself, was on this occasion heightened

Cape Moksuninskoj, where we visited a Samoyede family that
had set up their skin tent here in order to collect the necessary
stock of fish for winter; afterwards to ToUtoj Nos, a still in-

'the Russian,' and of astonishment that no creature pastured, no
scythe mowed the grass. Daily and hourly we heard the same
cry repeated, though in yet louder tones, when we some weeks

Royal Society, Nov. 19.—" On some Elementary Prin-
ciples in Animal Mechanics. No. VII. The Law of Fatigue."
By the Rev. Samuel Haughton, M.D. (Dubl.), D.C.L. (Oxon),
F. R. S., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin.
The approximate law of muscular action, which I have called
the law of fatigue, is thus expressed :—" When the same muscle
(or groups of muscl/s) is kept in constant action until fatigue sets
in, the total work done multiplying by the rate of work done is
constant."
The following experiments, in illustration of this law, were
performed in Trinity College during the spring of the present
year.
I instructed a number of medical students, chosen at random,
to raise dumbbells of varying weight, one in each hand, in the
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
transverse plane, with hands supinated, raising and lowering the
weights in equal times regulated by the beat of a pendulum.
This process was continued until the distress of the fatigue pro-
duced became intolerable, and the number of times each weight
was lilted was noted. The students were required to count
"one-two," in time to the beat ot the pendulum, so as to pre-
vent them from counting the total number of lifts of the weight.
Prof. Macalister assisted me in these experiments; and one of
us counted the number of lifts, while the other compelled the
experimenters to observe the conditions of the experiment, which
were :—
1. To keep time with the pendulum.
2. To raise the weight in the transverse plane.
3. To supinate the hands.
4. To abstain from all bending of the knees or spinal column.
For each experiment I chose twenty students at random, using
altogether about fifty different students ; and no individual was
experimented upon again, until an interval of forty-eight hours
had elapsed. The object of this arrangement was to avoid the
effects of " training." In my first Table I give the mean result
of twenty different students ; and in my second Table I have
selected one student, set aside for the purpose, and experimented
upon, once a week, so as to prevent the influence of "training."
Let W denote the total work done, and T the time of doing

and the peculiar respiratory organs'of birds, are class characters,
any animal would be a member of the class Aves which pos-
sessed them; and since the form of skull, of vertebra', of the
carpus and tarsus are ordinal characters in the existing sub-class
of birds, they will not necessarily be found in an extinct sub-class
or order of Aves. He then showed that Pterodactyles have the
brain identical with the bird's brain in every detail; and the
pneumatic perforations of the bones for the prolongation of air-
cells from the lungs into the tones were identical in both types
and are found in no other group of animals. Hence it was
concluded that, judged by class characters, Ornithosaurs must
be placed in the class Aves. The author then gave an analysis
of the characters of the Omithosaurian skeleton. In the skull,
he thought that the bone hitherto named post-frontal is the quad-
rato-jugal, and that although the malar bone meets the quad-
rate bone, there are no reptilian features in the skull, and no-
thing which is inconsistent with the Avian organisation. The
vertebral column is the most reptilian part of the skeleton
in being proccelous, but the fore limb was shown to be constructed
on the Avian plan; the carpus being nearly identical in both
groups ; while the elongated finger for flight was proved by its

carpal articulation to be the index finger as in birds ; and in one
Pterodactyle it contained two phalanges, as in birds. The petagial
membranes of the Pterodactyle were also shown to be extensions
of the similar membranes of birds. The characters of the pelvis
and bind limb were less unlike those of a bird than had been
supposed, the tibia terminating distally in a trochlear end formed
as in birds by the anchylosed proximal tarsal bone. From the
whole skeleton (excluding the evidence of the cerebral and
respiratory characters) the author concluded that it is impossible
on morphological grounds to exclude the Ornithosauria from the
Avian class, and that their resemblances to reptiles are not more
important than their resemblances to mammals.

On a new modification of Dinosaurian Vertebrae, by Prof.
Richard Owen, F.R.S. The peculiar modification of the Dino-
saurian vertebra noticed by the author occurs in Tapinoctphalus
Athtrslonii and Partiosaurus bombidens. In the dorsal vertebrae
of the former the centra are nearly flat on both fore and hind
surfaces, a structure to express which the author proposes the
term "amphiplatyan." The hind surface is very slightly the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
more concave. The middle of each surface is pierced by a small
foramen leading into a cylindrical canal, first slightly expanding
and then rapidly contracting to a point, which meets the apex of
the similar hollow cone coming from the opposite surface. Simi-
lar characters were observed upon the free surface of the anterior
sacral and upon that of the posterior of four anchylosed sacrals.
The dorso-lumbar vertebrae of the Pareiosaurus had centra rela-
tively longer than those of Tapinoctphalus. Their articular sur-
face is subundulate, convex along a fourth of the periphery,
concave at the centre, where there is an excavation corresponding
to that in Tapinocephalus, but a relatively wider aperture, a
rather more constricted canal, a shorter terminal cone, and an
interval of osseous tissue separating the apices of the cones from
the fore and hind surfaces. In what is probably the first cervical
vertebra of the same Dinosaur, the centrum is so concave on
both surfaces as to become amphicoelian. In these unossified
tracts of the middle of the centrum in the two genera above
mentioned the author sees indications of a persistent trace of the
primitive "chorda dorsalis;" and he calls attention to the resem-
blance thus set up between these probably Triassic Dinosaurs
and the lower Ganocephalous reptiles of the Carboniferous series,

canied out by Mr. Buchan. For this purpose the temperature
of the sea is observed at different parts of the coast; and stations
where maximum and minimum thermometers are constantly im-
mersed have been established. The investigation into the
habits of fishes is now to be further extended to those of the
salmon. For some years back observations have been made by
Mr. Paulin on the depth and temperature of the water and the
takes of fish in the Tweed, and these are being discussed by
Mr. Paulin and Mr. Buchan. Observations were also made for
some years on the temperature of the Doon in Ayrshire. But
the inquiry suggested by Mr. Young has more especial reference
to the question of the earliness or lateness of the different rivers,
which among other causes may be found to be due to the tem-
perature of the fresh water as compared with that of the salt
water into which the rivers discharge. It is hoped that by means
of this investigation the causes which produce late and early
rivers may be elicited, and the best times for closing and opening
different rivers for fishing may be more satisfactorily determined
than at present. On the suggestion of Mr. Young, different late
and early livers have been selected for observation, and the
necessary arrangements for carrying these on are being estab-

SC/EAT/F/C AGRICULTURE
FARMING is a complex business. It embraces a
greater variety of objects and interests than any
other industrial pursuit. Its two great ends are the
production of crops and the production of animals. It is
among the oldest occupations of man. Its history has
been very peculiar. In our own day the system of farm-
ing pursued by the great bulk of occupiers of land is far
behind the state of agricultural knowledge ; and many of
the practices of the most enlightened of our farmers are
based on empirical data. Various agencies have been
proposed for promoting agricultural progress. For the
instruction of the mass we must look chiefly to the diffu-
sion of agricultural knowledge through the medium of
ordinary schools and colleges, as was pointed out some
time ago in Nature. For further progress in the acqui-
sition of accurate knowledge wc must look chiefly to
experimental investigations.
In Germany they have had in operation for some years
a number of experimental stations which are partly sup-
ported by the State, and which are said to work satis-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
factorily. France and other European countries are
following the example of Germany. Recently the subject
has been ventilated in Great Britain. It has been forced
on our attention by a number of persons who are seem-
ingly desirous of giving to the farmer every aid which
science can suggest.
British experience of experimental stations is very
limited. We happen to have one at Rothamstead in
England, which was described in NATURE last year, and
which we owe to the enterprise of Mr. John Bennett
Lawes, F.R.S., the great manure manufacturer. He has
for upwards of thirty years used a part of his estate for
experimental purposes. He has published the results in
a vast number of papers. The whole is the work of the
man himself. He has had no aid from the Government
or any agricultural society, and no advice from any com-
mittee or public body. He has obtained a larger body
of facts in relation to manures and cropping, and the
feeding of animals, than all the agricultural societies in
the empire put together. It is manifestly desirable to
dwell on his labours and to contrast them with the more
public system projected elsewhere.
To Mr. Lawes' experiments I hope to be able to
devote another paper before long. For the present I
shall merely draw attention to the circumstances on
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which, in my judgment, the success which has attended
his labours has depended. Mr. Lawes has not bad an
unqualified success, especially in drawing inferences from
his facts. But his writings afford ample evidence of great
earnestness of purpose. His manly, outspoken language
shows that he loves truth for its own sake. He has had
ample resources; and he has had the motive of self-
interest, as well as love of knowledge, to stimulate him
in his investigations.
Here, then, we have a private individual who, unaided
by the State, or by any scientific body, has made a greater
number of useful experiments than all the experimental
farms of European Governments put together. Had the
British Government established experimental stations
Vol. xiii.—No. 319
before Mr. Lawes commenced, would he have established
his? And if not, would British agriculture have derived
more useful results from the governmental stations than
from his?
These are questions which cannot be answered by
direct evidence. We possess, however, data which

carrying out these recommendations they sugges'ed that
the 700/. should be expended as follows:—" Chemist's
salary, 300/. ; agricultural inspector's salary, 150/.," &c.
The report must render it plain to anyone who has
had experience in experimental work of the kind contem-
plated that this part of the recommendation is based on
imperfect knowledge. What evidence is there in the history
of the Society, or elsewhere, which goes to show that the
best man to initiate and conduct investigations on all sub-
jects relating to agriculture should be a professional che-
mist? Such a man should have a good general knowledge
of all the sciences relating to agriculture. He should be
well known as a man of broad views and great grasp of
mind. He should, moreover, be thoroughly conversant
with the details of modern agriculture. He should have
given evidence of being imbued with an ardent desire to
elicit truth, as well as of his taste and fitness for conducting
experiments. We submit that a really good chemist, pos-
sessing all these qualifications, can seldom be found, if
he exists in Scotland, let him by all means be made
director of the proposed station or stations; not,however,

because he is a chemist, but because he is the best man.
There are many chemists who would doubtless be glad to
accept such an appointment, and who would be 'as unfit
for it as for the direction of the Channel fleet. It seems
incredible that any body of thoughtful men would pro-
pose to trust the initiation and direction of experiments
on crops and animals to a man who would not necessarily
know anything of the habits of either.
A most peculiar part of the report of the committee
to which the Highland Society referred the consideration
of this question is the remuneration (150/. a year) they
propose for an agricultural inspector. If the views of
the committee were acted on, the bond fide value of the
experiments would depend on this officer. He should be
an accomplished agriculturist. He should possess great
intelligence, the highest personal character, and the
most rigid love of truth, as well as the sternest sense of
duty. He would be expected to initiate experiments from
which results of national importance would flow. And
this is the man for whom the munificent sum of 150/. a
year is proposed! If a man like Mr. Lawes were to under-
take the duty, he would accept no remuneration. In this
case 150/. a year may be a fair sum to cover travelling and
other expenses. But if a competent man is to be employed
who cannot afford to work gratuitously, a salary equal
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to that of the average of intelligent professional men
must be offered. This part of the Report has been
already denounced in strong and emphatic language ; and
we understand it has been opposed by leading members
of the Society who value science and appreciate the work
to be done. The action of the committee has been
openly exposed by Mr. David Milne Home, an ardent
advocate of the application of science to agriculture, and
by Mr. John Wilson, of Eddington Mains, a truly enlight-
ened farmer. These gentlemen contend that the.directing
head or body should have the power to call in the pro-
fessional aid of the best chemist or chemists, and such
other experts as may be needed. This view is based on
common sense. If they prevail in the councils of the
Society, we may expect to see ere long in Scotland agri-
cultural station! which in all human probability will give a
new stimulus to agricultural progress. If they fail, and
the work is entrusted to men who are not in every way
equal to it, we may get an annual crop of worthless
or misleading results, like those which have formed so
large a portion of our agricultural literature.

then C is D, it explains what is meant by its contraposi-
tive (if C is not D, A is not B), by its converse (if C is Z>,
^4 is B), and by its obverse (if /2 is not B, C is not Z>).
This last term we have heard strongly condemned; il was
substituted (see Fifth Annual Report) for the more usual
term opposite on the ground that, in logic, two opposite
propositions cannot be true together. The terminology,
however, to our mind, is a matter of no great consequence.
For proving converse theorems frequent use is re-
commended in the work of a " Rule of Identity" here
given, i.e. if there is but one A and but one B, then if A
is, B, it necessarily follows that B is A. (De Morgan's
illustration is given in Wilson's Geometry.)
The Straight Line is the subject of Book i., and takes up
five sections, Angles at a point, Triangles, Parallels and
Parallelograms, Problems, and Loci. Here, in the defi-
nitions, we have two difficulties to meet, What is a straight
line? what is an angle f The former is defined to be
"such that any part will, however placed, lie wholly on
any other part if its extremities are made'to fall on that
other part." The latter is stated to be a " simple concept

incapable of definition ;" its nature, however, is explained
and illustrated in some detail. Parallel straight lines are
defined as in Euclid, and Play-fair's axiom is Axiom 5.
Theorem 21 (Euc. i. 27) is proved as the contrapositive of
Theorem 9 (Euc. i. 16); Theorem.22 (Euc. i. 29) by Rule
of Identity, using Axiom 5. Book ii. treats of Equality
of Areas (Theorems, Problems); Book iii. lis on [the
Circle. Here a novelty is the treatment of Tangents in
two sections, directly, then by the method of limits.
Some, if not all, of De Morgan's suggestions (" Companion
to British Almanac, 1849) on this subject have been
adopted here. The Syllabus so far is not a novelty to
many of our readers. Those possessed of Mr. Wilson's
'* Elementary Geometry" (3rd edition) will know that he
has in the main, if not altogether, adopted the lines laid
down in the Association's work, adding proofs in full, and
much interesting illustrative matter. It hardly needs
our saying that the method of superposition is freely used,
and that alternative constructions are indicated.
We ;come now to Books iv. and v., which cover pretty
much the same ground, except that in the former book
we have the subject of proportion and its application
treated in a thoroughly rigorous method, which is a
simplification of Euclid's mode of treatment by multiples.
In the latter book the same subjects are treated in a con-

Similar figures, areas, loci, and problems complete

We shall conclude our notice by taking a few extracts
from the report made by the committee appointed by the
British Association "to consider the possibility of im-
proving the methods of instruction in elementary geo-
metry."
"It seems advisable that the requisite uniformity should
be obtained by the publication of an authorised syllabus,
indicating the order of the propositions, and in some
cases the general character of the demonstrations, but
leaving the choice of the text-book perfectly free to the
teacher. . . . The committee recommend that'the teaching
of practical geometry should precede that of theoretical
geometry, in order that the mind of the learner may first
be familiarised with the facts of the science, and after-
wards led to see their connection. With this end the in-

Mr. C. R. Markham in the R.G.S.

Ethnology" (1875) is quite as con-
sistent with all the facts as Dr.
Rink's, if not more so. Mr. Markham

lieving that at no very remote period

hordes from Central Asia. We doubt
if these Tales and Traditions will help
us much towards a knowledge of the
origin and early history of the Es-
kimo. Indeed we doubt very much
if we have yet data sufficient to
authorise us to pronounce with any-
thing like confidence on the subject.
The volume contains in all 150 Eskimo tales and tradi-
tions, some of which, however, are only fragments. They
have been taken down from the recital of natives of South
and North and East Greenland and of Labrador. A vast
amount of material was thus collected, many of the tales
being evidently variants of one original. This material
Dr. Rink has redacted, "all the variations being most
carefully examined and compared for the purpose^of com-
posing a text such as might agree best with the supposed
original and most popular mode of telling the same story."
For general purposes this method is, no doubt, quite
satisfactory, but if these tales and traditions are to be of

nation, and many of them Dr. Rink believes to be far
older than a thousand years. Probably they originated
when the Eskimo lived together before their migrations
began, and while it is not unlikely that most of them took
their rise in some actual incident, they have all evidently
been much changed and elaborated by the introduction
of the mythical and supernatural. The second class are
limited to certain parts of the country, or even to certain
people related to each other, "thus presenting the cha-
racter of family records." But the recent, like the ancient,
tales have all more or less of the mythical element in
them, and indeed it is mainly from the tales and tradi-
tions as a whole that a knowledge of the elaborate and
intricate Eskimo mythology has been obtained. The
Eskimo have peopled the air, the earth, and the sea with
a multitude of supernatural beings ; they live as much in
an unseen, but to them real and populous, world, as they
do among the hard realities of their land and seas. It
is very characteristic of them that they have placed their
heaven where we have placed our "bad bit," as they call
it in Galloway, under the earth, as being so much warmer

than the ungenial sky, to which their wicked are con-
demned to freeze eternally. Of the comparatively modern
tales a very few relate to the collision which took place
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries between the
Eskimo and the Icelandic colonists who had been settled
in South Greenland since the eleventh century. One
relates to two Eskimo who were taken to Europe by
some of the early explorers of Greenland, and in both
cases the mythical has been largely introduced, affording a
good example of how these stories have grown, and show
ing that while a basis of truth exists in the older stories,
the older they are the more difficult it would be to get at it.
While many of the stories are really interesting, there
is a great deal of sameness about most of them. Many
of them relate to feats of strength, which, formerly at
least, seem to have been much admired by the Eskimo.
Indeed, it is evident that it was no uncommon thing
among them for men to go through a regular and well-
devised system of "training" in order to develop
muscle and endurance. A large number of them
relate to the means adopted by the people to carry
on the struggle for existence both against the stern
powers of nature that everywhere meet them and
against the cunning and competition of their fellows.

and by the members of a family for each other. Alto-
gether they show the Eskimo to be on the whole gentle,
hardy, hospitable, capable of strong attachment, but often
capriciously revengeful and spiteful, even to his dearest
friend. There is very little of the tender element of
love in these stories, an element which figures so pro-
minently in the folk-lore of most other nations. These
stories also show that the Eskimo have the poetic tem-
perament in a very fair degree, though most of them are
artless enough, and many of them quite objectless and
tame in the result. They very frequently remind us of
the Brownie tales of Scotland, and some fragments of
poetry which Dr. Rink gives, have quite an Ossianic
ring about them. The best complete stories are much
too long to permit of our extracting one here, though
the following short one is a fair example :—

played by our Transatlantic brethren in turning every
scientific discovery to practical account, we must at the
same time observe that only a very few of the voluminous
reports received by us from the various States contain
matter sufficiently novel to demand extended notice at
cur hands. Dr. Sutton's report, admirable as it is in
many respects, forms no exception to the general rule.
By European helminthologists the recognition of Trichi-
nosis in the human subject is no longer spoken of as a
'recent discovery," seeing that Zenker, whose merit in
this relation is supreme, diagnosed the "loathsome
disorder" in i860, whilst the antecedent steps in the
chain of evidence were long previously established by
Leuckart and Vichow (1859). Herbst (1850), and so on
backwards, until we come to the date of the original dis-
covery of the worm as a nematoid by Paget, and its sub-
sequent description by 0*en (1835). We may go even
further back than this, and point to Wormald and Hilton's

11 ichina capsules, and also to their still earlier detection
by Peacock (1828), to say r.othing of the evidence in
favour of Tiedemann (Fronep's Notizeu, 18:2). We must
dissent altogether from the view expressed by Dr. Sutton,
that Trichinosis probably caused " the ancient Jew to pro-
hibit the use of pork" as food. On the other hand, we
are glad to perceive that our author adds his testimony
to the view previously taken by ourselves and others, that
there is no connection between trichinosis and the so-
called "hog cholera." In this regard Dr. Sutton would
have done well to have consulted Prof. Verrill's various
papers {American Journal of Science and Arts; Report
of Connecticut Board of Agriculture, 1870), and, if
possible to him, also, our own subsequent contribution
on Stephanurus (NATURE, vol. iv. p. 508). Lastly, we
can only remark that if Germans will not abandon their
habit of eating "smoked sausages" they must expect to
be trichinised. Clearly, the fault is their own.

late friend, It is of course impossible to supply the place of the
naturalist whose collections I shall do the best to describe, for
with him has perished much knowledge of the habits and distribu-
tion of the animals, and although this want can be partially atoned
for by the copious notes he has left behind, much unfortunately
can never be replaced. . . . There is always more difficulty in
procuring specimens of Mammalia than in collecting terrestrial
animals belonging to most of the other classes of vertebrata and
invertebrata, and this is especially the case with the larger forms.
It is consequently not to be expected that the species repre-
sented will be more than a portion of those inhabiting the
country. Still the collection is rich in some respects, and espe-
cially in kinds of rodents, and it adds largely to our knowledge
of the fauna of Western Tibet and Eastern Turkistan. The
larger mammals, indeed, were origitia'ly better represent J, but
after Dr. Stoliczka's death many specimens appear to have been
removed from the collection. Such at least was the case with the
ruminants. In a private letter which Dr. Stoliezka wrote to

Glands of the Cherry Laurel
In Nature (vol. viii., p. 245) Mr. Thiselton Dyer, in answer
to a correspondent, says that he knows of no explanation ot the
purpose or origin of the nectariferous glands on the back of the
leaf of the cherry laurel. Mr. Darwin ("Origin of Species,"
sixth edition, p. 73) says: "Certain plants excrete sweet juice,
apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from
the sap; this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of
the stipules in some Leguminosa:, and at the backs of the leaves
of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is
greedily sought by insects; but their visits do not in any way
benefit the plant." Glands cannot be considered very complex
modifications of cellular tissue. They exist on all parts of plants,
and contain a great variety of secretions. Mr. Darwin and others
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
have shown that they perform the varied functions of secreting
nectar to attract insects to flowers, of secreting odorous matter
for the same purpose, of absorbing ammonia from rain-water and
the products of decomposed or digested animal or vegetable
matter, and of secreting acids capable of digesting solids. The
existence of free acids in the plant would be injurious to it, so
that their excretion would be beneficial to it apart from any
digestive function which they may in some cases perform. The
Clands of the laurel are so far unspec'alised that they are by no
means constant in number or sire. As their attracting insects is
of no service to the plant, the nectar must be said to be
excreted ; but, being what Sachs has termed (p. 629) a "secon-
dary product ot metastasis," it should be looked upon rather as
a physiologically accidental excretion than as positively injurious,
as a substance which, having ceased to take part in the processes
of growth, has not acquired an indirect function as has the nectar
of flowers. To account for the position of the glands it may be
suggested that, as in other evergreens, the leaves of the laurel
are "reservoirs of reserve material" in which metastasis, in-
cluding the separation of the "formative materials" from the
"secondary products," mainly takes place (Sachs, p. 627).

900 feet high. Something similar is well known to the inhabit-
ants of Arequipa, Peru. The city is built at the base of the
extinct volcano "Misti," which rises above the plaza of Are-
quipa to a height of about 12,500 feet; Arequipa itself being
over 7,000 feet above the level of the sea. It is not an uncom-
mon occurrence (during the fall of the year, February and March)
in the morning, from sunrise till about ten o'clock, to see a suc-
cession of clouds rolling along the summit from N.E. to S.W.,
much as if huge masses of white smoke were issuing from the
extinct crater. These clouds are either suddenly shot upward
by meeting the current from the S.W. and lost at a distance of
from 30,000 to 40,000 feet to the eastward from the summit, or
else, rolling over the summit, they are carried by the easterly
breezes till they become absorbed by the dryer and warmer air
of the region to the southward of Misti.
It must be remembered that between Arequipa and the sea,
at a distance of not more than thirty miles, extends the great
sandy desert of Islay, having an average breadth of about twenty-
five miles, and before the days of the railroad the great terror of
all travellers from the rea-coast to the interior. Of course the

slope of Misti, on the contrary, forms the edge of the elevated
plateau extending for more than 150 miles to the eastern slope of
the Andes, having an altitude of irom 10,000 to 14,000 feet, and
the amount of rain falling in this district is very great.
The formation of the cloud, seen Irom Arequipa on the summit
only of Misti, is plainly seen from the railroad leading to Puno,
which, after leaving Arequipa, makes a gigantic sweep north-
ward round the Chacharni Mountains, and winds its way east-
ward behind Misti at a height of about 12,500 feet above the
level of the sea. There I have several times seen masses of
vapour, condensed into huge white clouds rolling along the
slopes of Misti, travel up with great rapidity towards the summit,
and either follow its crest as described above, or become at once
reabsorbed on reaching the top. This shows plainly that the
clouds seen from Arequipa are not due to volcanic action ; the
Indians also all agree in stating that there is no tradition among
them of Misti having been active. I enclose a sketch of Misti
and its cloud from a photograph obtained during my visit to
Peru. Alexander Agassiz

The Effect of Waves

of heavy waves ceases, and that during a hurricane all is quiet a

few fathoms beneath the surface. II this be correct, why should
a swell show such a marked increase in height when it rolls over
the edge of soundings?
On the parallel of Cape Clear, in longitude 15' W., seamen
are familiar with this phenomenon, although the depth is nearly
five hundred fathoms ; at times it is so marked that the" dead
reckoning may be checked by carefully noting the increase in
the depth of the hollow of the waves. Shortly after the edge of
soundings is passed the sea becomes more regular, and! conse-
quently less dangerous to deeply laden vessels.
Anyone who has watched during a moderate breeze the com-
motion of the water close to a quay wall can form a good idea
of the ocean when it receives its first check against the Irish
Plateau ; the great waves twist around each other, run up ani
down in heaps, and then fall suddenly as if bereft, in a great
measure, of their forward motion.
Again, it is a well-known fact that during a " norther" in the
Gulf of Mexico the frailest vessels weather out the storm if they
can cross the edge of the Campeachy Banks; a striking proof
that at a depth of over fifty fathoms there is sufficient abrasion
to destroy the force of the heaviest wave in a very effectual style.

gestion by Prof. Tietjen that No. 152, discovered by M.
Paul Henry at Paris on November 2, may prove to be
the same planet which was found by M. Borelly, 1868,
May 29, and which received the name Dike. No. 152
passed the ascending node soon after noon on November
3, the geocentric longitude at the time being 41° 54',
and it was not far from opposition, which is so far favour-
able to the supposition of identity with Dike, with
ascending node in 410 50' according to the most probable
orbit that could be obtained from the short course of
observations in 1868. Dike was estimated of thirteenth
magnitude, yet in 1868 was observed within 10° from
perihelion ; in ascending node the planet would be less
than 29° from aphelion; No. 152 is called eleventh mag-
nitude, a difference, considering the respective orbital
positions, which is adverse to identity. The unfavourable
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
weather has prevented observations sufficient for a proper
calculation of elements for No. 152. Should this planet
prove to be identical with No. 99 (Dike), the numbers from
153 onwards will of course require to be diminished by one,
and the actual number of small planets, including M.
Borelly's late discovery, will stand at 156.

Around the circumference were placed upright slabs of
limestone three feet high, and at least ten bodies had been
lodged in the grave, arranged in a sitting posture with
their backs against the slabs, and the hole had then been
filled up. The teeth showed that the majority were of
middle age, whilst the remainder included old persons
and children still retaining their milk teeth. The lime-
stone slabs projected a few inches above the present sur-
face of the soil, so that if the grave had ever been covered
with an earth mound the latter must have been removed,
perhaps washed away. The only artificial object found
was one solitary potsherd; hence there is no evidence to
prove or disprove any speculation which may be indulged
respecting the people whose burial-ground had been thus
laid open in the interest of science. It is perhaps safe to
conclude that all the bodies found in the grave were

of a steep hill of loose rock led into a large gallery
several miles in length, the floor of which was covered with
fallen rocks. Small areas were occasionally found, how-
ever, where no such masses presented themselves, but
where fires had been kindled, and where small piles of
stones had been raised around a small central hole
having ashes and remnants of burnt sticks at the bottom;
whilst on the adjacent rocks there were in some cases
found small bundles of sticks tied with bark, and of a
convenient size to be placed in the holes, thus indicat-
ing that they had been brought into the cave to be used
as lights and as firewood.
Further on, in a small chamber never previously visited
by a white man, there were seen on the cave earth the im-
prints of feet shod with peculiar braided mocassins or san-
dals. In some of the side chambers were found a great
number of cast-off sandals, very finely made of the twisted
leaves of some rush braided in a careful and artistic way.
The manner of braiding was identical with that of the straw
sandals from China, but the form of the sandal itself was
different. About twenty-five of these sandals, of various
sizes and of slightly varying designs, but all worn through
at toe and heel, were found in the interior chamber of
the cave.

Italian physicists, whose names we are sorry to say are
not so familiar to us. Prof. G. Cantoni's numerous papers,
the titles of some of which are given in translation above
refer to minute but interesting points in connection with
the electrophorus and condenser, in which certain views
of Beccaria (1769) and of Volta (1775) are revived and
defended and connected with Faraday's theory of elec-

The title at the head of our list refers, not to papers read

of forty-nine experiments, and the inference to be drawn
from each one, and illustrated by a number of woodjen-

One portion of the object of these papers is to confirm and
extend Faraday's beautiful theory. Indeed, the subject,

others, that we do not feel called upon to give an analysis

unknown to the Italian physicists. In this work some of
the points in question have already been considered expe-

Signor Nardi's first pamphlet is a curious exemplifi-

eye on certain cases that contained some of the apparatus
of the physicist Fusinieri, who in his own day occupied a
respectable position in science, and whose results, when
true, have since been absorbed into the great body of
science. Hence his name is not much known out of
Italy; but, in his native town, his memory is naturally and
very properly cherished; so that, when holding a cen-
tenary festival in honour of his birth, in February last, the
good citizens of Vicenza were naturally grateful to be

hero. Our author had long regarded these relics with
curiosity, until, stimulated by the prospect of this festival,
he felt an ardent desire to accomplish something. He
says :—" The exquisite politeness of the keepers of this
museum, first, that of Monsignor Pietro Canonico Doctor
Marasca, and then that of Monsignor Ludovico Canonico
Gonzati, threw open to me the sanctuary [that is, they
unlocked the cases]. Their encouragement imparted to
me the courage to do something, which I now publish in
time for the public festival, which I may emphatically
term national, in honour of him who is now revered as
one of the most eminent physicists of this age."
Guided by the published collected works of Fusinieri,our
author examines every article and fragment of the imper-
fect collection thus thrown open to his inspection. No
devotee before the shrine of a saint could display more

HERR W. SIEMENS has recently made the following
interesting communication to the Academy of
Sciences of Berlin :—
It has been shown by Willoughby Smith and by
Sale that crystalline selenium conducts electricity better
when illuminated than when in darkness. The specific
conductivity, however, of selenium rendered crystal-

line by heating from 100° to 1500 C. is very small and
extremely variable; and also the increase of the con-
ductivity through illumination is very inconstant, so that
it is impossible to establish a determinate dependence of
the conductivity on the illumination.
Herr Siemens has succeeded, by continuous heating of
amorphous selenium to a temperature of 210°, as also by
cooling of melted selenium to 2100 (at which temperature,
long continued, the selenium passes into a coarse-grained
crystalline state), in producing another modification of the
crystalline selenium, which has considerably greater con-
ductivity, and retains it, and conducts electricity metalli-
cally, so that with increase of temperature the conduc-
tivity decreases. The action of light on this modification
of crystalline selenium is much greater, and apparently
quite constant. By fusing in two flat spirals of wire,
about 1 millimetre apart, between two leaves of mica in
coarsely crystalline selenium, he has obtained an exceed-
ingly sensitive measure of light. Dark heat rays are
without direct influence on the conductivity, and heating
of the selenium, as already mentioned, diminishes the
same. Diffuse daylight even doubles the conductivity of
this light-measure, and direct sunlight increases it some-
times more than tenfold. The increase of conductivity
of the coarse-grained selenium through illumination takes

place very quickly. And similarly, the diminution of it,
on shutting off the light, occurs, apparently, at once; but
a longer time is required before the state corresponding
to darkness is again fully established. The increase of
the conductivity is not proportional to the light intensity,
but a function of it, which comes near the proportion of
the square root of the light intensities.
Herr Siemens hopes this interesting property of sele-
nium may be utilised for construction of a reliable photo-
meter. W.

advanced that a meeting of the subscribers will be held in Bristol
on Saturday next, to authorise the committee to take the neces-
sary steps to incorporate the College. In a telling article in
Monday's Western Daily Press the need of such an educational
institution in Bristol, as well as in all our other industrial centres,
is forcibly shown. The increasing importance of scientific
knowledge even in our most trivial manufactures is well pointed
out; only by thoroughly training the rising generation can we
hope to compete successfully with foreign manufacturers. It
is a hopeful sign to find the subject taken up by the newspaper

On November I a Stenographic Exhibition was opened in a
room of the Pedagogic Museum of the College, Rome. Steno-
graphy at the present day occupies a very important part in the
requirements of public life, and we believe the effort to encou-
rage its study by a public exhibition will lead to useful results.
On the walls of the room were a list of the Italian towns that
had a school or society for stenography. The only method fol-
lowed is that of Gabelsberg-Noe. On a table in the centre of
the room were stenographic attempts of every kind, from large
plates for elementary study to the smallest and most minute
works. In one case, Dante's "Divine Comedy " was copied out
into a book of Lilliputian dimensions. On a post-card one
stenographer had written 3,660 words. The committee who
arranged the exhibition wish to reproduce on the historical wax
tablet the stenographic marks with which Tiro wrote the speeches
of Cicero.

details, showing that these instruments were invented in Italy,
and not by foreigners, as has been supposed. He showed also
that the study of the original instruments was of great interest in
connection with the history of the progress of the surgical art.
On two tables were arranged eighty instruments which had
belonged to surgeons of Novicia and Delle Preci in Umbria.
Many of these instruments, it was interesting to observe, re-

A report by Mr. Frank Buckland, on the fisheries of Nor-

visitors from the salmon rivers in the north, viz., the Tyne, the
Tees, the Coquet, and the Tweed. The object of this visit to
the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk is to find food, which exists
in abundance in the shape of the spawn and fry of the many
varieties of fish which abound in' those waters. The report con-
tains much interesting matter ^relative to the crab, lobster, and

it will thus be seen that, owing to the absorptive power of the
terrestrial atmosphere, the radiant intensities transmitted from
the opposite poles of the luminary differ considerably. The
magnitude of this difference, adequate to explain the discrepancy
under consideration, need not excite surprise if we consider that
thirty-two minutes of zenith distance involves an additional depth
of more than half a mile of atmosphere to be penetiated by the
rays projected towards the actinometer from the south pole of
the sun. The foregoing facts show the necessity of taking the
difference of zenith distance between the opposite
poles into account in making exact observations
of the sun'» polar temperature, especially at the
iower altitudes where the secant ol the zenith
distance increases rapidly.
Regaidi'g the calorific energy of the radia-
tion emanating from the border of the sun, I
deem it proper to present the following brief
statement. Several observations during the early
part of the investigation pointed to the fact that
;ncreased energy is transmitted to the actino-
melers by radiation from the sun's border.

Again, considerable irregularity was observed
in the progressive diminution of the force of
radiation touaids the circumference of the solar
disc. It was shown in the preceding article
(vol. xii, p. 520) that the radiation from the border
zone, l' 42" wide, occupying one-filth of the
area of the solar disc, transmits 0638 of the
intensity transmitted from an equal area at the
centre of the disc. Of course it will be supposed that the ra'e
of the diminution of intensity within the zone thus ascertained
is much greater near the border of the photosphere than at the
middle of the zone. Such, however, is by no means the case,
notwithstanding ihe assumption of phycisists that the heat trans-
mitted by radiation from the border is very feeble. In order to
test the truth of the indications referred to showing considerable
radiant energy at the border of the photosphere, a very careful
investigation was made, Sept. 9, 1875, by means of screens
excluding the rays from the solar disc, as shown in Figs. 12 and
13. The diameter of the screen represented in Fig. 12 being
154 "06 millimetres, covered nine-tenths of the area of the disc;
while the screen shown in Fig. 13, being 14525 millimetres,
covered four-fifths of the disc. It will be well to mention that
the dimensions of the screens referred to correspond with the
angle subtended by the sun when the earth is in aphelion. Ac-
cordingly the distance between the actinometers and the screens

was adjusted previous to the observation, viz. shortened, in
order to compensate for the increase of the angle subtended by
the sun. Agreeable to the stated dimensions of the screens, it
will be found that the zone represented in Fig. 13 is i'42",
while the zone in Fig. 12 is 49"'6. The mean width of the
latter is consequently situated only 24'"3 from the border of the
photosphere.

NATURE
THE GRAPHIC METHOD OF REPRESENTING
MUSICAL INTERVALS*
""THE object of the paper was to explain a method of repre-
¦*¦ sentiog musical intervals, which was very useful in giving a
clear idea to the mind of relations often complex and obscure.
The author pointed out that there was a natural tendency to
refer the positions of musical notes to positions in space. It was
by no means clear that there was any real physical or physiolo-
gical relation between the two things, but somehow or other the
idea had become so firmly rooted in the mind that it had deve-
loped itself in expressions of every-day use. For example, it
was customary to call a note with rapid vibrations a high note,
and one with slow vibrations a low note. Few people considered
whether there was any natural justification for these terms;
probably there was none, but they had existed almost ever since
music had taken a definite form, and had given rise to the torm
of notation employed to express the positions of musical sounds.
It followed from this that the musical idea of distance between
two notes, which was technically called a musical interval,
might be considered as having an analogy between the high and
low positions of the two notes respectively, a greater interval
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
being represented by a greater space, and vice versA; and carry-
ing this idea out to its full extent it became possible to represent
musical intervals to the eye in such a way as to convey ideas of
comparative magnitude precisely analogous to the impressions
which these intervals would make on the ear. This the author
called the graphic method of representing intervals.
The idea of such a method had been embodied from early
times in the word scale, which was derived from the Latin scala,
a ladder, thereby clearly implying an analogy between the
spaces of the steps and the intervals of the notes. Mr. Hullah,
in some of his elementary books, had actually made use of a
diagram of a ladder for this purpose, and he had introduced the
improvement of representing the intervals between the third and
fourth and between the seventh and eighth steps (of the diatonic
major scale) as only half the length of the other degrees,
thereby embodying, in a graphic mode, the distinction in magni-
tude between the whole tones and the semitones. What the
author proposed to do in this paper was merely to establish this
mode on definite principles, and; to give it more capability and
more accuracy.
It was well known that the scientific definition of a musical
interval was expressed by the ratio which the vibration-number
of the higher sound bore to that of the lower one, and it had
been shown that the idea of the magnitude of the interval in a
musical sense might be expressed by the logarithm of this ratio.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Hence, by plotting down this logarithm with a scale of equal
parts, and drawing a line of that length, such a line would be a
correct graphic representation of the magnitude of the interval.
The author explained the mode of doing this in a simple prac-
tical way, which might be put in practice by anyone, with the
aid of a small table of logarithms, as easily as working a simple
sum in arithmetic; and he calculated and laid down several
examples in the presence of the audience. It would be, he said,
sufficiently accurate to express the distances in three places of
figures, as, for example :—
The interval of an octave would be expressed by a line whose
length was—
= log. 2 =301
That of a major—
Sixth — log. I =222
That of a minor—
Sixth = log. I = 204
That of a fifth—
= log. \ = 176
That of a fourth—
= log-s =125

its position, has a more southern stamp. This appears partly by
Novaya Zemlya being much richer in species than Spitzbergen,
of which species several occur which belong to families not
represented on Spitzbergen, and partly by the vegetation of
Novaya Zemlya being richer in individuals. At many places,
especially in the more southerly patts of the land and the inte-
rior of the fiords, the ground is covered with thickly-matted
plants, to which there is nowhere on Spitzbergen anything corre-
sponding. Their closeness and variety of colour often awoke
our surprise and astonishment. The phanerogamic vegetation
of Novaya Zemlya connects itself by means of common species
not only with that of Spitzbergen, but also with the floras of
Arctic America and northern Noiway, and that of the shores of
the Gulf of Bothnia and the Asiatic Continent.
"The more southern character exhibited by the phanerogamic
vegetation of Novaya Zemlya, as compared with that of Spitz-
bergen, is as good as absent in its marine alga;. The same
dissimilarity is also apparent with regard to the fauna. The
land fauna is more southern, the marine fauna is high Arctic.
The most of the marine alga? known to exist at Spitzbergen are
found at Novaya Zemlya, and of the species collected here there

is only one that is wanting on the coasts of Spitzbergen.
"Of fresh-water alga?, mosses, and lichens, we have made
considerable collections. Of mushrooms, on the contrary, we
obtained very few. Either it was a bad mushroom year on
Novaya Zemlya, or else, what is less probable, this class of
plants is very sparingly dislributed on these islands.
"As on the coasts of Greenland and Spitzbergen, so in the
patts of the Polar Sea we now visited, the surface tf the sea at
certain places which appear to be sharply defined is quite full of
diatomaceoe. A belt of special richness we found on the north
coast of Noiway, extending in an easterly direction from North
Cape to the mouth of Tana Fiotd ; another, less rich and of less
extent, we found in the neighbourhood of the Samoyede
peninsula.
"Through the researches of Th. von Heuglin, we have already
a good knowledge of the vertebrates of Novaya Zemlya. The
attention of our zoologists has, however, jbeen directed to this
group of animals, and by their observations our knowledge of
them has been very considerably extended. This specially holds
good of the biids.
"Along the whole west coast south of Matotschkin Scharr, as
well in the open sea as in the fiords and sound where we sailed
through and lay at anchor, dredging has been assiduously carried
on. The rich collections thus made will certainly, when they
are examined, afford a very complete idea of animal life in this

region. Few species of animals were previously known as
existing here, and as to the distribution of the different species
along that extensive coast all information has hitherto been
wanting.
"Among the zoological work'a conspicuous, place is occupied
by a rich insect collection by which the knowledge that we pre-
viously bad of Novay a Zemlya's insect world will be very consi-
derably extended. Formerly from this region only four or five
species of insects were known. The expedition's collection con-
sists of about 500 specimens, and includes numerous representa-
tives of nearly all the orders of insects.
"Most important, however, in a zoological aspect, appear to
me the numerous dredgings which were carried on in the Kara
Sea, and which prove that in this sea there is, as has been
already mentioned, abundant animal life of very various types.
The collections made here arc large, and must be specially valu-
able for zoological science as coming from a considerable region
of the Polar Sea, of which the zoology is little known, but espe-
cially because this extent of sea exhibits in different tracts so
considerable dissimilarities with respect to depth, content of salt
in the water, &c."

Royal Society, Nov. 25.—" On the Replacement of Elec-
tro-positive by Electro-negative Metals in a Voltaic Cell," by
J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Che-
mistry in the Royal Institution, and Mr. Alfred Tribe, Lecturer
on Chemistry in Dulvvich College.
It is well known that one metal exerts a greater chemical
force than another, and is capable of displacing it from its com-
binations. Among those metals with which we are familiar,
potassium is looked upon as the most powerful ; and it is a cer-
tain fact that calcium, barium, strontium, aluminium, and mag-
nesium have been isolated by its agency. It could scarcely be
expected, therefore, that any other metal could directly replace
potassium. If such should happen, we should have an instance
of reversal, and should expect to find, on examination of the
conditions, an agent capable of doing just the reverse work of
what is usually assigned to affinity.
It is also well known that in a simple voltaic cell, such as zinc
connected with platinum in dilute hydrochloric acid, the more
powerful or electro-positive metal, zinc, displaces the hydrogen
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
that is in combination with chlorine, and the hydrogen makes its
appearance against the less powerful or electro-negative metal,
platinum. The chemical theory of galvanism supposes that the
force originates in the chemical action which takes place between
the zinc and the acid; the contact theory supposes that it ori-
ginates in some unexplained manner in the opposite electrical
condition of the two metals induced by their contact. If the
chemical theory be the true one, it is evident that a zinc-platinum
cell can only become active when the binary liquid contains
hydrogen or some metal which is less powerful than zinc. If,
for instance, we were to employ a potassium-salt instead of a
hydrogen compound, it is inconceivable, on the pure chemical
theory, that thtre should be any action at all.
Such an action, however, does take place if we substitute the
chloride of potassium for the hydrochloric acid; the zinc com-
bines with the chlorine, and the potassium is set free in some
form against the platinum, manifesting itself by the presence of
free alkali and hydrogen gas. The same holds good with chlo-
ride of sodium, or ammonium, or barium, strontium, calcium, or
magnesium.
This action is slow; but if magnesium be used instead of zinc,
it takes place sufficiently rapidly to be easily observed, and we
have therefore studied the action of platinum and magnesium in
connection.
After an account of the experiments, the paper concludes as

If one metal in conjunction with another more electro-nega-

it may be expected, d fortiori, that it can decompose one of its

action to nil by our utmost efforts to exclude all oxygen, and the

described by us before the Physical Society, that mercury and
gold in conjunction would decompose mercuric chloride, with
deposition not only ol lower chloride, but also of metallic mer-

ployed for giving the radiant energy of the sun's rays acts upon
the following principle:—In the first place the instrument is
sheltered from the sun, but exposed to the clear sky, say for five
minutes. Let the heat so lost be termed r. Secondly, the in-
strument is turned to the sun for five minutes. Let the heat so
gained be termed R. Thirdly, the instrument being now hotter
than it was in the first operation, is turned once more so as to
be exposed to the clear sky for five minutes while it is shielded
from the sun. Let the heat so lost be termed r'. It thus
appears that r denotes the heat lost by convection and radiation
united, when the instrument, before being heated by the sun, is
exposed for five minutes to the clear sky, while r denotes the
heat lost by these same two operations by a similar exposure
after the instrument has been heated by the sun; and it is
assumed that the heat lost from these two causes during the time
when the instrument is being heated by the sun will be a mean
between r and r1, and hence that the whole effect of the sun's
rays will be in reality R + - . Now although this assump-

being true. It would therefore seem to be desirable to get rid of
this uncertainty by constructing an instrument in which we are
sure that the causes of variability are not allowed to operate.
These causes of variability I have attempted to get rid of in the
following manner. With the help of Mr. Jordan, mechanician
at Owens College, the following instrument has been constructed.
It consists of a large mercurial thermometer with its bulb in the
middle of a cubical cast-iron chamber, this chamber being of
such massive material that its temperature will remain sensibly
constant for some time. The chamber with its thermometer has
a motion in azimuth round a vertical axis A, and also a motion
in altitude round a horizontal axis B. A 3-inch lens C of 12
inches focal length is attached by means of a rod to the cubical
chamber, so as to move with it. The nature of this attachment
will be seen in the figure. Thus the whole instrument may be
easily moved into such a position that the lens, as well as the
upper side of the chamber which is parallel to the plane of the
len>, may face the sun, and an image of the sun be thrown
through the hole D in the side of the chamber upon the ther-
mometer bulb E. The stem of the thermometer protrudes from
the chamber as in the figure. A screw S, somewhat larger in
diameter than the bulb of the thermometer, is made use of to
attach the thermometer to its enclosure, and a smaller screw S',
pressing home upon india-rubber washers, enables the thermo-
meter to be properly adjusted and kept tight when in adjust-

ment. In the present instrument the internal diameter of the
chamber is two inches, while the bulb of the thermometer is about
1 \ inches in diameter. The scale of the thermometer is very
open, more than an inch going to one degree. I have generally
allowed the image of the sun given by the lens to heat the ther-
mometer bulb for one minute, during which time an increase
of temperature, not exceeding in any case two degrees, has
been produced. As far as principle is concerned there appears
to be no objection to the present instrument; nevertheless it is
open to a very serious practical objection. The scale being so
very open, the stem comprehends only a few degrees; fre-
quently, therefore, the temperature is such that the extremity of
the mercurial column is either below or above the stem. Now
the thermometer has a small upper chamber, and by means of a
method of manipulation well known to those who work with
thermometers, it is possible to add to or take away from the
main body of mercury in the bulb, so as to keep the end of the
mercurial column always in the stem. But experience has con-
vinced me that for a thermometer with such a large bulb, fre-
quent manipulation of this kind is not unattended with danger to
the bulb. On this account the instrument in its present form is, I

crotonic chloral is really butyric chloral. Its derivative with
hydrocyanic acid is not trichloroangelic, but trichorovalerianic
acid. Its product of oxydation and subsequent reduction are
not chlorocrotonic, but chlorobutyric acids. Potash does not

what was then said. The "Schopfungsgeschichte" is
the earlier work of the two; it deals more with the
general question of the evolution of the Organic Kingdom
and less with its special application to Man; its tone is
somewhat more moderate, and its statements and plates
are less highly coloured. But the object and the style of

lectures several points have been established which neces-
sitate a modification of the views here expressed. The
origin of the urino-genital organs has been proved in the
classes as yet completely examined to be from the middle
layer of the embryo ; the embryology of Amphioxys and
of Mollusca has been elucidated—by none more than
by the editor of this translation; the placental classifica-
tion of Mammalia, never accepted by all zoologists, has
been almost reduced to the same rank as Waterhouse
and Owen's cerebral system ; the true nature of Lichens
has been cleared up, and relations between Algae and
Fungi have been established which disturb the roots of
the genealogical tree on Plate V. Moreover, Dr. Dohrn's
bold speculations lately published in his pamphlet " Der
Ursprung der Wirbelthiere und das Princip des Func-
tionwechsels," have brought the question of degradation
of many lower forms as well as of the genetic relations of
Vertebrata into a new phase. It is remarkable how little
the previously well-known instances of "degraded forms"
are considered in these lectures. Surely some of the
numerous twigs of the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth plates
might have been turned downwards.
But whatever may be thought of the advantage of exhi-
biting together established truths and more or less erro-
neous speculations, in a dogmatic and controversial form,

before an uncritical audience, there is no question of the
value of these lectures to naturalists. They awaken
thought, provoke criticism, and stimulate inquiry.
Turning from the subject-matter to the translation, we
must call it an exceedingly good one. No one who has
not tried knows the difficulty of presenting a continuous
work in a foreign language to an English reader so as to
drop the idiom and yet retain its character. If a page of
the body of the work be compared with Prof. Haeckel's
own preface — written in very good English, but as a
foreigner writes—the reader will see at once how much
he is indebted to the lady who, we are told, made the
first draft, or to Mr. Lankester, who revised it.

the habitual use in German of vernacular phrases in
scientific writing, made this a good opportunity for trying
an experiment which the translator has before now recom-
mended. The result shows great ingenuity and good
judgment, and is probably as successful as the conditions
of the attempt allow.
It will be generally admitted that the English language
is incomparably richer and more flexible than the French,
while it lacks the precision and neatness which with ordi-
nary French writers is apt to become too mechanical and
uniform, but in the hands of a master produces the most
perfect instrument for scientific exposition. On the other
hand, German is far more cumbersome and undisciplined
than English, but has a slovenly ease, a picturesque force
and a power of adaptation and word-making, which re-
minds one of our own language in the first half of the
seventeenth century.
A French scientific writer cannot make a new term or
form a compound in his own language, but must con-
struct a Greek compound (often ill-formed), and even
this must be modified so as to assimilate it to French
pronunciation. And comparing the style of Bichat and
of Cuvier with that of contemporary writers, we see that
the stiffness and severity of the language has increased
during the present century. Germans, on the other hand,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
can invent compounds without limit in number or in
length, and can introduce foreign terms as they are
wanted, even declining them in accordance with the Ger-
man prepositions against which they are thrown.
The English language has much less power of forming
compounds, though poets like Tennyson and Morris
show us how flexible it becomes in powerful hands ; but
it has a remarkable capacity for assimilating foreign
words. The unequalled richness of the language chiefly
depends on its having so many synonyms, and this again
on its composite character. The choice of words like
friendship, amity; righteous, just; begin, commence;
wax, increase; weariness, fatigue; spue, vomit; raise,
erect; fruitful, fertile, gives peculiar accuracy, character,
and delicacy to modern English.
If purely English words were to be generally adopted
in science, we should, in the first place, be obliged to
shock modern decorum in a way that would be practically
impossible. Germans still write of Kothentleentng, Wol-
lustor^ant; Afterbildunq; but such plainness of speech
would be intolerable in English. Even such words a;.

Congo. By Richard F. Burton. Two vols. (London:
Sampson Low and Co., 1876.)
THE journeys here recorded were made so long ago as
1862 and 1863. Since that time Capt. Burton has
not been idle; between exploring and publishing the
results of his explorations he has sufficient excuse for
having kept from the public for so long the narrative of
his trips to the Gaboon and the Congo. Moreover, as he
says himself, Africa moves so slowly, that ten years
makes scarcely any appreciable change on a locality.
The publication of the work at the present time is oppor-
tune, as public attention is being directed to the region
with which it is concerned j the German African Society
have taken up the Congo district as a. point de dtpdrt for
the interior, and although the expedition sent out has not
been so successful as might be wished, still Dr. Pogge
and Dr. Lasaulx, according to the latest news, are en-
deavouring to push inwards from Loanda. There have
been several explorers on the same ground since Capt.
Burton visited it twelve years ago, and there have been
many previous explorers—the stretch of coast Included in

settlements; but as was shown in his recently-published

even on the most frequently trodden paths. The present
work will be found a substantial contribution to our
knowledge of the Gaboon and Congo districts, especially
in the matters of geography, topography, and people.
Capt. Burton's visit to the Gaboon extended over only a
few weeks in March and April 1862, but during'that time,
his first volume shows, he managed to see and to learn
much. He is nothing if not unflinchingly true to his
opinions, and these, as usual, he expresses freely and
without respect of persons throughout the two volumes.
He gives rather an unpleasant picture of the character
and condition of the French trading establishments on
the Gaboon, and indeed has not much praise to bestow
on any of the establishments, French, Portuguese, or
English, which he has occasion to mention in his work.
Capt. Burton's chief object in visiting the Gaboon was to
obtain some specimens of Gorilla, and, if possible, get a
young one alive. He did not, however, get a shot at one
during all the'time of his visit; but a fine specimen was
sent him by a native before he left, which, in a sadly
deteriorated condition, now rests in the British Museum.

upon it he gives some interesting details. A good map
of the coast districts for two degrees on each side of the
equator accompanies the first volume.
The second volume refers to a visit made in July —
September, 1863, to the Congo and the Portuguese
settlements on the adjoining coast. Concerning these
settlements many valuable and curious facts are given
throughout the volume, both historical and as the result
of the traveller's own observation at the colony of Loanda.
Capt. Burton notes a considerable improvement in the
morals and manners of the settlers as compared with
previous accounts. The picture of the English establish-
ments at Loango is not a very bright one. He paid a
visit to Calumbo on the Cuanza or Ouanza river, and
mentally noted an exploration eastwards which he pur-
posed to make in the future, but which he is glad to see

was made, during which, of course, many notes are made
on the character and customs of the people. Ambriz has
recently come to the front in connection with the German
African expedition.
The chief interest of the second volume is connected
with the Congo river, up which Burton journeyed as far as
the Yellala, or rapids, which he calculates to be between
116 and 117 miles from the mouth, the total fall in that
distance being 390 feet, of which 195 feet occurs between
the Yellala and lioma, 64 miles. From the Great Rapids
to the Vivi or lowest rapids, a distance of five miles, the
fall is 100 feet. Some important facts are given as

to the character of the Congo mouth and the changes
which are constantly taking place, which must even
yet be of value to chart constructors. Considerable
details are also given concerning the delta or series of
islands at the mouth of the Congo, and a chapter is
devoted to the explorations of previous travellers. An
amusing account is given of his interview with the
native king at Banza Chisalla, a few miles above
Boma, and in this connection an attempt is made to
account for the fondness for what seems to us a most
ridiculous dress on the part of African and other
savage potentates. The author gives a minute and
graphic description of the river and its many reaches

between Boma and the rapids; the scenery on the banks
is often quite Rhine-like in its character. The river
itself Capt. Burton regards as one of the noblest in the
world. With a valley area of 800,000 square miles, it has
a yearly mean volume of 2,500,000 cubic feet per second,
nearly four times that of the Mississippi, which has a
very much larger drainage area. In this connection some
interesting data are introduced concerning the four great
African arteries, the Nile, the Niger, the Zambeze, and
the Congo or Nzadi, as Capt. Burton makes the true
native name to be. In the chapter, "Notes on the Congo
River," which contains the summary of the explorations
of previous travellers, Capt. Burton discusses the probable

connection of the Congo with the water system of Central
Africa. This chapter altogether is one of the most
valuable in the book.
On his way to the rapids he was detained for some
time at the village Banza Nokki, near one of the
upper reaches of the river, and of course took the
opportunity of studying the people, who seem to have
been but little affected by the labours of the Portu-
guese missionaries who lived among them for so many
generations. The district Burton describes as a perfect
paradise, the country lovely, and the climate all that can
be-desired. Very full details are given as to the ways of
life of the people, their various customs, their supersti-
tions, their language, &c. After the usual vexatious
delays, Capt. Burton was able at last to set out on
Sept. 16 for the cataracts of the Congo. These and

river banks and of the people dwelling near, are de-

far as Nsundi, upwards of 100 miles beyond the Yellala,
but the difficulties thrown in his way by the chiefs on
whose expensive favour he was dependent, compelled
him to return. In a chapter on "The Slaver and the
Missionary on the Congo River," he records opinions
which are well deserving the attention of all who not
only wish well to the native African, but who desire that
the best means be taken for developing the immense
resources of that continent, and of tropical countries
generally. He concludes "with the hope that the great

four principal African arteries, will no longer be permitted
to flow through the White Blot, a region unexplored and
blank to geography as at the time of i!s creation, and that
my labours may contribute something, however small, to
clear the way for the more fortunate explorer." There
can be no doubt that his labours, short as his time was,
have added materially to our knowledge of the region
visited, and his work must henceforth be regarded as one
of the chief authorities, not only on the river and its
geography, but on its people, and to a considerable

Ltuckartii is figured from a perfectly fresh specimen.
No very rare species among the Echinoderms is cata-

that at the commencement of the experiments recited in

Theophrastus versus Millington
I.s" a letter in Nature, vol. xiii. pp. 85, 86, Mr. Bennett
nppears to contend—
1. That if the credit of suggesting the true function of the
stamens of flowering plants is to lie attributed to either, it
belongs to Grew rather than to Millington.
2. But that even the views of the former were not materially
in advance of those of Theophrastus.
First, as to a bibliographical matter, Mr. Bennett speaks of a
Fecond edition of Grew's book. There is no such thing. The
"Anatomy of Plants," 16S2, contains four books; the first of
these was published in 1671, the second in 1673, the third in
1675. The fourth book, not published till 1682, contains the
celebrated passage on the sexuality of plants. This was read
before the Royal Society, Oct. 26 [Nov. 9], 1676.
Turning to p. 172, we find Chap. V. "Of the Use of the

Under the best circumstances and reading with the right eye,
A's mean error is only ;' -4- 5000 on the space of i -=- 139; and
as the distance was about six inches, this is rtrfrirn of the dis-
tance; agreeing with the size of the smallest line visible, which
is about Trim t0 rtrjinr °f ,ne distance according to circum-
stances, but without any shadow to the wire examined. As to
the observers, A has had practice lately in measuring ; B had
much practice some years ago; C and E are ladies of artistic
tastes but unmetrical; D is moderately accustomed to measuring,
but has a difference between the focus of his eyes. It would be
highly interesting to have a good collection of statistics on this
question, from among surveyors, mechanics, and the unmetrical
classes. I proceed to readings for other points, made by A.

Thus the size of the division does not seem to much affect the
estimation, the extreme difference being 4:5. If the angular
width of a space exceed 50 it is not so easily grasped by the eye,
though the error is not perceptibly increased till it exceeds 200.
The »-;- 41 space was read with a magnifier, (x 3), so it was
equivalent to i H- 14.

space is rather too wide angularly to be grasped by the eye at
once ; and therefore that the want of grasp is the defect corrected
by consideration.
(5) The effect of looking at the space askew was tried by
viewing it at 300 to either side; shifting sides ten times so as to
avoid any gradual change in the quality of the reading, and so
as to call up the contrast more strongly. The results of careful

NATURE
The + and - below show the mean error in that digit to exceed
or fall short of the mean of all (I -44). The readings are on a 1 -inch
space. Thus it is apparent that the errors exceed the mean in
the four middle digits, and fall short of it in the others with but
one exception.
Now, the practical results which may be deduced from these
data are as follows :—
From (1), that there is considerable variation in accuracy of
estimation; yet, in persons fit to estimate, it may be put at
d -=- 50 up to d 4- 100; and therefore as the maximum error in
some hundreds of readings is only about three times the average
error, it is useless (and, worse than that, confusing) to have
divisions smaller than 20 x the quantity required to be read.
The application of this result to surveyors' rods, &c, would be
very conducive to ease in distant reading.
From (2), that for ordinary eyes about »-f- 2000 is the mean
error of reading (with one eye only), and therefore that i ^fjnr
is the smallest size useful for reading with the naked eye; conse-
quently any closer divisions than these (^ of an inch) are detri-
mental because of the greater confusion they introduce.
From (4), that in small divisions no consideration is neces-

sary, as the first instinctive impression is nearly, or quite, as
accurate as careful estimation.
From (5), that it is important not to look at a space askew;
and that if unavoidable, careful consideration is desirable.
From (6), that in reading a series of observations of one
amount, the right and left eyes should be used alternately to
equalise the + and - errors.
From (8), that the right eye should be used in preference to
the left.
From (9), that both eyes should be used wherever possible.
From (10), that red is the worst colour for measures, and that
green or blue are as good as white; so that blue and white
would probably be the best practically, and more distinct from
vegetation, &c, than the green at a distance.
From (11), that more care is required in readings in the central
portions of a space than at the ends. This is as true on spaces
of i -T- 41 as on 10 i spaces.
Of course some of these results may be pirsonal errors, and
not generally true, but at least this notice will perhaps call the
attention of those accustomed to estimation to the subject, and
so elicit some definite statistics. There are many other interest-
ing questions which I have not touched on here as being of less
consequence, and not affecting practical questions so much as
the foregoing results; these results it is to be hoped may lead to
a better acquaintance with a subject of such practical im-

RIITIMEYER ON TRACES OF MAN RE-
CENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE INTER-
GLACIAL COAL-BEDS OF SWITZERLAND
THE last number of the Archiv fiir Anthropologic
contains a short but important article by the emi-
nent zoologist of Basle, Prof. Riitimeyer, on some traces
of man recently discovered in the interglacial coal-bed at
Wetzikon. Escher von der Linth first called attention to
the fact that at several places in East Switzerland, espe-
cially on the eastern shore of Lake Zurich from Wetzikon
to Utznach, and again in the neighbourhood of the Lake
of Constance, there are beds of coal, which are not only
covered by, but which also repose on, well-marked glacial
deposits, thus clearly proving the existence of more than
one period of extreme cold, as first remarked by Morlot,
and since confirmed by many observers, and especially
by Geikie.
These interglacial coal-beds contain numerous remains
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of plants and animals, among the most interesting being
those of Elephas antiquus and Rhinoceros merkii. The
remains of plants are indeed so numerous that Dr.
Scheuermann, of Basle, has been in the habit of breaking
up himself all the coal used as fuel in his house, in search
of vegetable remains. In doing so he was struck on one
occasion by observing a number of pointed rods lying
side by side, and he placed the block of coal containing
them in the hands of Prof. Riitimeyer.
Prof. Riitimeyer has now given a description and
figures of these rods, from which it is clear that they
have been intentionally pointed, and that they formed a
portion of rough basket or wattle work. They are four
in number, and are closely embedded in the coal, which
they precisely resemble in colour, while the texture is that
of the ordinary wood found in these coal-beds. More-
over, as is usual in such cases, the stem has been com-
pressed, so that the section is not circular but oval. Ac-
cording to Prof. Schwendener, the wood is that of Abies
excelsa. The points bear evident traces of cutting, while at
one part of the rods are marks as if of a string wound round

changing at various points both in direction and velocity, requires
the application of forces the sum total of which in a longitudinal
direction is zero, as long as the end of each stream has the same
direction and velocity as the beginning. Therefore the sum total
of forces (in other words the only force) brought to bear upm the
holy by the motion of the fluid in the direction of its flow, is
aero*
I have now shown how it is that an infinite ocean of perfect
fluid flowing past a stationary body cannot administer to it any
endways force, whatever be the nature of the consequent devia-
tions of the streams of fluid. The question, what will be in any
given case the precise configuration of those deviations, is irrele-
vant to the priof I have given of this proposition. Nevertheless
it is interesting to know something, at least, of the general
character which these deviations, or "stream-lines," assume in
simple cases; therefore I have exhibited some in Figs. 26, 27,
which are drawn according to the method explained by the late
Prof. Rankine.
The longitudinal lines represent paths along which particles
flow; they may therefore be regarded as boundaries of the
streams into which we imagined the ocean to- be divided.

,We see that, as the streams approach the body, their first act
is to broaden, and consequently to lose velocity, and therefore,
as we know, to increase in quasi-hydrostatic pressure. Presently
Fig. 26.
they again begin to narrow, and therefore quicken, and diminish
in pressure, until they pass the middle of the body, by which
time they have become narrower than in their original undis-
turbed condition, and consequently have a greater velocity and
less pressure than the undisturbed fluid. After passing the
middle thty broaden again until they become broader than in
their original condition, and therefore have less velocity and
greater pressure than the undisturbed fluid. Finally, as they
recede from the body they narrow again until they ultimately
resume their original dimension, velocity, and pressure.
Thus, taking the pressure of the surrounding undisturbed fluid
as a standard, we have an excess of pressure at both the head
and stern ends of the body, and a defect of pressure along the
middle.
We proved just now that, taken as a whole, the fluid pressures
could exert no endways push upon the stationary body. We
now see something of the way in which the separate pressures
act, and that they do not, as seems at first sight natural to
expect, tend all in the direction in which the fluid is flowing ; on
the contrary, pressure is opposed to pressure, and suction to
suction, and the forces neutralise one another and come to

nothing, and thus it is that an ocean of perfect .fluid flowing at
steady speed past a stationary submerged body does not tend to
push it in the direction of the flow. This being so, a submerged
body travelling at steady speed through a stationary ocean of
perfect fluid will experience no resistance.
We will now consider what will be the result of substituting
an ocean of water for the ocean of perfect fluid.
The difference between the behaviour of water, and that of the
theoretically perfect fluid is twofold, as follows :—
First The particles of water, unlike those of a perfect fluid,
exert a drag or frictional resistance upon the surface of the body
as they glide along it. Thi3 action is commonly termed surface-
friction, or skin-friction; and it is so well-known a cause of
resistance that I need not say anything further on this point,
except this, that it. constitutes almost the whole of the resistance
experienced by bodies of tolerably easy shape travelling under
water at any reasonable speed.
Secondly. The mutual frictional resistance experienced by the
particles of water in moving past one another, combined with
the almost imperceptible degree of viscosity which water pos-
sesses, somewhat hinders the necessary stream-line motions,

132
[Dec. 16, 1875
NATURE
to the two causes I have just spoken of, namely surface-friction
and mutual friction of the particles. The stream-line motions
being the same in character as those we have been considering,
we shall still have at each end an excess of pressure which will
tend to force up the sheet of ice, and along the side we shall have
defect of pressure tending to suck down the sheet of ice. If,
now, we remove the ice, the water will obviously rise in level at
each end, so that excess of hydrostatic head may afford the
necessary reaction against the excess of pressure ; and the water
will sink by the sides, so that defect of hydrostatic head may
afford reaction against the defect of pressure.
The hills and valleys thus formed in the water are, in a sense,
waves; and, though originated in the stream-line forces of the
body, yet when originated they come under the dominion of
the ordinary laws of wave-motion, and, to a large extent, behave
as independent waves.
The consequences which result from this necessity are n-.ost
intricate; but the final upshot of all the different actions which
take place is plainly this—that the ship in its passage along the
surface of the water has to be continually supplying the waste of
an attendant system of waves, which, from the nature of their
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
constitution as independent waves, are continually diffusing and
transmitting themselves into the surrounding water, or, where
they form what is called broken water, crumbling away into froth.
Now, waves represent energy, or work done; and therefore all
the energy represented by the waves wasted from the system
attending the ship, is so much work done by the propellers or
tow-ropes which are urging the ship. So much wave-energy
wasted per mile of travel is so much work done per mile; and
so much work done per m>le is so much resistance.
The actions involved in this cause of resistance, which is some-
times termed "Wave-Genesis," arc so complicated that no ex-
tensive theoretical treatment of the subject can be usefully at-
tempted. All that can be known about the subject must, for the
present, I believe, be sought by direct experiment.
Having thus briefly described the several elements of a ship's
resistance, I will proceed to draw your attention more particu-
larly to certain resulting considerations of practical importance.
Do not, however, suppose that I shall venture on dictating to
shipbuilders what sort of ships they ought to build: I have so
little experience of the practical requirements of shipowners, that
it would be presumptuous in me to do so; and I could not ven-
ture to condemn any feature in a ship as a mistake, when, for all
I know, it may be justified by some practical object of which I
am ignorant. For these reasons, if I imply that some particular
element of form is better than some other, it will be with the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
simple object of illustrating the application of principles, by
following which It would be possible to design a ship of given
displacement, to go at given speed, with minimum resistance, in
smooth water—in fact, to make the best performance in a
"measured mile" trial.
I have pointed out that the causes of resistance to the motion
of a ship through the water are : first, surface-friction ; secondly,
mutual friction of the particles of water (and this is only practi-
cally felt when there are features sufficiently abrupt to cause
eddies) ; and thirdly, wave-genesis. I have also shown that
these are the only causes of resistance. I have shown that a
submerged body, such as a fish, or torpedo, travelling in a per-
fect fluid, would experience no resistance at all; that in water
it experiences practically no resistance but that due to surface-
friction and the action of eddies ; and that a ship at the surface
experiences no resistance in addition to that due to these two
causes, except that due to the waves she makes. I have done
my best to make this clear: but there is an idea that there exists
a kind of resistance, a something expressed by the term "direct
head-resistance," which is independent of the above-mentioned
causes. This idea is so largely prevalent, of such long standing,

mulating the data required on this branch of the subject.
I wish in conclusion to insist again, with the greatest urgency,
on the hopeless fatility of any attempt to theorise on goodness of
form in ships, except under the strong and entirely new light
which the doctrine of stream-lines throws on it.
It is, I repeat, a simple fact that the whole framework of
thought by which the search for improved forms is commonly
directed, consists of ideas which, if the doctrine of stream-lines
is true, are absolutely delusive and misleading. And real im-

THE CHANNEL TUNNEL—SUBMARINE
EXPLORATIONS^
N important Report in connection with the proposed
- -* Channel Tunnel has just been issued by the French
Submarine Railway Association, giving the results of a
detailed examination of the French coast, and of soundings
taken in the bed of the Channel during the past autumn.
The subject has on previous occasions been referred to in
the pages of this Journal;% but before giving an account
of the recent explorations it may be well briefly to refer to
what has already been done. ,
A tunnel under the Channel has long been talked of,
and many schemes have been brought forward ; but the
only one which has been received with general favour is

that of Sir J. Hawkshaw, who proposes to carry the
tunnel from the South Foreland to near Sangatte. In
j 864 Mr. E. C. H. Day was employed by Sir J. Hawk-
shaw to make a geological survey of the neighbouring
coasts with the view of obtaining some guide as to the
probable outcrops beneath the Channel; the map thus
produced was published with the early statements of the
Company. In 1866 borings were made on both coasts
to prove the succession of the strata at points near which
the tunnel was to leave the shores ; that on the shore at St.
Margaret's Bay traversed 240 feet of upper chalk and 296
feet of lower chalk, and was stopped in the gault at a
depth of 567 feet from the surface. The boring on the
French coast was put down a little north of Sangatte ;-it
passed through 70 feet of drift-sand, &c, 190 feet of chalk
with flints, 284 feet of chalk without flints, and was
stopped at a depth of 551 feet from the surface owing to
an accident to the hole. This boring, therefore, did not
reach the Upper Greensand, and the depth to this bed
was estimated from information obtained in the deep
boring at Calais. This accident was unfortunate, because,

not cause any uneasiness or extra expense on this account.
For the rest the explorations are highly satisfactory, and
the extension southwards of the gault is no disadvantage.
Besides the outcrop of the "craie glauconieuse," which
almost corresponds to the outcrop of the gault, the
engineers profess to have determined the line between
the " craie de Rouen," or lower chalk, and a nodular bed
which lies above it. One cannot help feeling doubts as
to the possibility of this being done, with any degree of
certainty, by the means at their disposal. It is, however, im-
portant to fix if possible the breadth of outcrop of one of the
beds ; because, the thickness being known, we can thus
estimate the dip. The soundings, as interpreted by the
Commission, show that the dip is greatest near the French
coast, and that it gets gradually less towards the English
coast. Borings at and near Calais show that the dip
there lessens towards the north, and by analogy it may
be inferred that towards the proposed tunnel the beds
under the sea will also lessen in dip.
It is proposed to continue the soundings further north,
with the view of fixing exactly the outcrops of the higher

beds of chalk. As the report states, if these attempts
are successful we shall know exactly, and not by hypo-
thesis, the geological structure of the strait. We shall
know too the geological structure of the bed of the sea
better than we now know that of much of the dry land ; for
no geologist has attempted to trace out all the chalk divi-
sions on either coast ; they have been measured in the
cliffs, but not mapped in detail inland.
The Commission recommends that a new and larger
borehole be put down at Sangatte with the view of testing
the water-bearing qualities of the chalk at different levels,
and of proving the exact thickness of the chalk. It is
proposed to carry the hole through the gault and into the
Pateozoic rocks, with the view of testing whether these
rocks are absorbent, and capable of carrying off water
from the tunnel. The possibility that they may serve this
purpose has been suggested by the present writer.* The
Commission proposes to test the point, but observes that
it is unlikely to be the case. The Pateozoic rocks yield
water near Lille, though they have not done so at Calais
and Harwich; this may be because the old rocks are
only slightly permeable, and if so they will be only slightly
absorbent. It was on this gronnd that Prof. Prestwich
proposed to tunnel through the Pateozoic rocks.
The Commission has examined in great detail the chalk
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of the French cliffs, and the results of their observations
are drawn in a section in this Report. W. Phillips in 1819
published a description of the cliffs on each side of the
Channel. So far as his observations go they are exact,
and need no correction; later observers having only
worked out the beds in greater detail. The Report refers
in terms of well-merited praise to this early work of
Phillips, but it is slightly in error in stating that English
geologists have done nothing since his time. The Geolo-
gical Survey has been over the ground; the maps are
published, and descriptions have been given by Mr.
Whitaker. Mr. Dowker has also studied the higher chalk
of Kent.
The Report contains a large chart showing the posi-
tions of all the soundings, and is further illustrated by
sections and diagrams in the text. It is one of the most
valuable publications which has yet appeared on this im-
portant subject, and is well worthy of the reputation of its
distinguished authors. W. TOPLEY

recently in Naples and the surrounding region, one of the most

not, however, consider Vesuvius to be the centre of the dis-

ON SOME PROPERTIES OF GALLIUM

NATURE
The salts of Ga which M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran has used in
his researches, have been from the blend of Pierrefitte; he has,
however, found the new metal in other ores of zinc, and notably
in a transparent blend from Santander. He believes Ga will be
met with in all blends. The Ga he extracted from the blends
comes really from these minerals, and not from metallic zinc.
The author's last researches have confirmed the rarity of
gallium in blend. The extreme sensibility of the spectral re-
action led him even to over-estimate the quantities obtained. "I
do not think I exaggerate," he remarks, "in saying that in my
first observation I possessed at the most jfy of a milligramme of
the new substance dissolved in a very small drop of liquid. The
spectral analysis of so small a quantity of matter would have been
impracticable before the considerable reduction I made in the
dimensions of the apparatus for obtaining electric spectra, and
without using very small sparks.
"If, as I suppose, there is no error as to the nature of my
alum of Ga, the existence of this salt fixes the atomicity of the
new element, and attributes to its oxide the same chemical
function as that of alumina. The oxide of gallium, then, will
be written GajOj."

The author, in conclusion, refrains, for the present, from dis-
cussing the theoretical considerations raised in a recent note by

him ; but he thinks it very probable that without the particular
method followed in the present research, neither M. McndeleefTs
theories nor his own would soon have led to the discovery of
gallium.

The conclusions arrived at are that the amyloid substance
found in the liver is a body which tends to accumulate in certain
animal structuies under the existence of a limited supply of
oxygen, and that it is through the liver exceptionally receiving
the supply of venous blood it does, that the special condition
belonging to it is attributable. It is also shown that the undue
transmission of oxygenated blood to that organ at once induces
an altered state, which is rendered evident by the production of
glycosuria.

tion Z = Y* - (- i)"*~*1pX* admits of a multiplicity of
solutions, and to ascertain the law connecting the various solu-
tions, when there is more than one." The solution of this

paper is carried. The other connections are as follows :—The
current passes from one pole of battery to spring of releasing
apparatus (which is also connected with one terminal of a separate
condenser), thence through the bullet to the fixed portion of the
clip, and by a wire to the lower table, which is also in electrical
connection with the face of the electro-magnet which releases the
bullet, in order that the current may be completed immediately
the falling body is released. From this table the current passes
through an adjusting screw to one terminal of the primary wire of
the induction coil which is connected with the other condenser
terminal. The other pole of the battery is connected with the
primary. The spark in each case is caused by the breaking of
the current which takes place when the bullet is released
and when it strikes the table, the perforations in the black
paper of course being made in the trace produced by the
tuning-fork. It is hardly necessary to mention that the re-
leasing electro-magnet is worked by one or two independent
cells. The author considers that with a fork making sixty-four
complete vibrations in a second the error, in determining an
interval of not more than two or three seconds, should not
exceed T\ 0th of a second, and that with a more rapidly vibrating

fork probably much greater accuracy might be attained. Mr.
Lodge made four experiments before the Society with falls of
2 ft. and I ft., from which the value of gravity was found to be
32'2i. Prof. Guthrie inquired whether the instrument was sen-
sitive to the influence of temperature on the time of vibration of
the tuning-fork. Mr. Ladd suggested that the pressure of the
marker on the end of the tuning-fork mi^ht hinder its vibration,
and referred to difficulties which Capt. Noble had met with in
the working of his chronograph. Mr. Lodge stated that experi-
ments had only been made in a laboratory having a fairly equable
temperature, and that therefore the effect of considerable changes
of temperature had not been ascertained. He considered that
the slight resistance referred to by Mr. Ladd would rather tend
to diminish the amplitude of vibrations than to change their
number per second.—Prof. McLeod then described and exhibited
an arrangement for ensuring that the charge given to a Leyden
jar shall not exceed any fixed limit Through a cork in the
upper end of a bell-glass passes a brass rod, insulated through
its entire length by means of a glass tube, through which it
passes freely. To the upper end is attached a brass knob, and the
lower end is pointed and provided with a screw-thread, so that
it can be set at any distance within, or through, a hollow brass
ball, perforated below and rigidly fixed to the glass tube. Within
the bell-glass is a loose cage of perforated sheet zinc and a vessel
containing strong sulphuric acid. The whole stands on a metallic

plate to secure a good earth connection. The action is as fol-
lows : —If the rod be screwed down so that the point projects
through the hollow ball, the upper knob and lower metallic
plate being connected with the two poles of a Iloltz machine,
only short sparks can be obtained, because a large amount of
electricity escapes at the point ; but if the rod be raised so that
the rod barely enters the hollow ball, at the top, no escape takes
place from it, and the machine will give its full length of spark.
By varying the position between these two extreme limits, any
required length of spark or amount of charge for an interposed
Leyden jar can be obtained.

LORD DERBY ON THE ENDOWMENT OF
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
WE do not think it possible to estimate too highly
the value of Lord Derby's address last Friday
at Edinburgh, and his statements as to the rapidly
widening fields of science and the increasing value of
the results of scientific research. We shall simply con-
tent ourselves with quoting the very remarkable views
he put forth as to the duty of the State with regard to the
encouragement of research, views which, when we con-
sider the character of the speaker and his official position,
must be regarded as of the greatest significance. After
speaking of the all-absorbing nature of scientific research,
of the necessity of complete devotion to a special depart-
ment in order to achieve success, and of the "world-
wide benefit" of scientific results, Lord Derby said :—
"Science, above all, needs leisure, and I hope it is not
Utopian to look forward to the possibility of a far ampler
provision being made for its prosecution by competent
persons than exists at present. I do not refer merely or
principally to help from the State ; though, speaking for

myself, I should not grudge it in such a cause. But the
spirit of patriotism which animated founders of schools
and colleges and public benefactors of former days is not
extinct; in some directions it is more flourishing than
ever. An American banker lately gave half a million to
help the poor of London ; a well-known Scotch gentleman
has given the same sum within the last few years in aid of
the Kirk of Scotland ; money is never wanting at either
end of this island when men see their way to make a good
use of it. When have schools, hospitals, public parks,
museums, institutes been more abundant than at the
present day? Science has no endowments, or next to
none; but only because the interest in that class of
subjects is comparatively new, and rich men, who want
to do some good with their capital, have not looked
much in that direction as yet. Is it too sanguine
a hope that we may see individual liberality take
a form which hitherto it has rarely taken? Who
knows how many discoveries might be worked out,
how many conquests of man over nature secured, if for,
I do not say a numerous body, but even for some 50 or
100 picked men, such modest provision were made that
they might be set apart, free from other cares, for the
double duty of advancing and of diffusing science? Who
can measure what has already been lost to England and

to the world, when intellects capable of the highest kind
of original work have been wasted, not by choice, but by
necessity, on the common drudgery of every-day life? I
know very well that to some extent that must continue
to be the case; it is visionary to contemplate a state of
society in which every man will find exactly the employ-
ment that suits him ; in human life, as in nature, there
will always be a vast apparent waste of power. But we
may at least reduce that waste where we see it going on;
original capacity is not so common that we can afford to
vbtow it away, nor so difficult to discover that we may
excuse ourselves by saying we did not see it. I am quite
aware that endowments of all sorts are discountenanced
by a certain class of thinkers, of whom I speak with re-

spect, but who, I think, argue from the abuse of a thing
against its use. The fact remains that the most enduring
and valuable work done in the line of pure science will
not bring a shilling to the man who does it ; and while
that is so (and one does not see how it can be other-
wise), there seems nothing unreasonable in saying that

"The real advancement of science needs, as Lord
Derby says, leisure, and the power and opportunity of
purely disinterested study. In this sense all scientific
men will agree with Lord Derby that science needs more
help. We have, indeed, in England, some very illus-
trious living examples of men who not only teach, as
a daily and laborious duty, the methods and results
of scientific investigation, but who have themselves, in
a precious and hard-earned leisure, carried that inves-
tigation far forward along paths hitherto untrodden. But
it has occurred to every reader of their writings to ask
what they might have added to the world's knowledge
had they been able to devote their whole time and strength
to their favourite pursuit. There is a growing conviction
that investigation of this kind, as apart from teaching,
ought to be encouraged by the State. Lord Derby would
not grudge it he!p, even from national resources ; but he
throws out a suggestion which may be commended to the
notice of men who, like the late member for Bridport,
have money to leave, and are on the look-out for
heirs. We have, as Lord Derby says, bequests of all

kinds ; and it would be a welcome sign that science had
been made popular, even in a sense he would approve, if
bequests of large sums to endow original research should
come into fashion."
The Daily Telegraph says :—
"And here the speaker could not but touch on the
question of the better endowment of scientific research,
which he disposed of by heartily wishing that such bene-
volent people as give half a million to a charity, or to the
Kirk of Scotland, would turn the stream of Pactolus upon
the dry ground of natural science. There is no soil which
would yield back more profitable harvests. A discovery
in mechanics or physics benefits all mankind ; and great
investigations are undoubtedly kept in abeyance for want
of the help which society does not, and the Government
cannot, bestow. Lord Derby, indeed, expressed himself
willing to advocate all that could be done in this direction
by a Government; but his opinion is that the community
must take up the question, if anything really large was to
be hoped for, though something might, perhaps, be
effected by the careful application of old endowments,
upon which point the Lord Rector uttered some observa-
tions balanced so finely that a pinch of the dust of a
'dead founder' would turn his well-trimmed scales."
The Globe speaks as follows :—

"Valuable as were the hints suggested on what may be
described as the conduct of intellectual life, still greater
interest attaches to Lord Derby's observations on the
subject of scientific research and University Reform. On
the former topic scientific men have sometimes talked
rather wildly of late, as if it were the duty of the State to
provide an elaborate scheme for the endowment of
science. Lord Derby did not accept this view; but he
distinctly laid it down that the community has not yet
realised the vastness of its obligations to science, and
that, when it does so, much larger funds will be devoted
to its encouragement than are now available. He also
declared that, for his own part, he would not object to the
State doing something to foster original research. These
utterances will be eagerly fastened on by scientific men,
but it may perhaps be questioned whether the difficulties
in the way of definite action are not somewhat underrated.
By what tett would it be possible to select the men who
should be supported for the purpose of extending the
bounds of science? And if this difficulty were overcome,

dispersed. A considerable number have, however, since
found their way either into the Christy collection, or into

Green, and have been described in greater or less detail.
Cut with the exception of a brief account of the war
weapons of this people which was contributed by Mr.
Petherick to the Journal0/the United Service Institution

The tribes referred to in this volume are named Dinka,
Dyur, Bongo, Mittu, Niam Niam, Bellanda, Monbuttu,
Sere, and Kred, and as a rule the same types of art with
innumerable but closely-allied varieties pervade the whole
of them. Imitation of natural forms, that invariable cha-
racteristic of primitive arts, is not less frequent here than
amongst other savages; thus we find amongst the Bongo,
bells and rattles in imitation of leguminous fruits, and
iron thorns upon the heads of spears, both named and
copied from the Makrigga, a thorny shrub of the district
which no doubt was used and served as a model for these

barbarous weapons before the introduction of iron. Not-
withstanding the prevalence of iron, the Mittu and some
other tribes still employ an arrow with a hard wood point
or fire-shaft in preference to the iron ones, which carry
only one-third the distance although with greater accu-
racy of flight
The partiality for doubling certain objects without in
most cases the least practicable utility being perceptible
is noticed by the traveller as a characteristic of Central
African art. Thus we find double points to roofs, double
pipe-bowls, double lance-heads, double spoons, and double
bells included amongst the objects illustrated. The art
of the carpenter, as with most savages, appears to be
confined to carving household utensils such as seats,
tables, dishes, boxes, mortars, musical instruments,
canoes, &c, out of a solid block | the joiner's art seems
almost unknown, the only exception here recorded being
a sleeping-bench of the Monbuttu tribe, in which the
framework of Kaphia stalks is fastened to the feet by
pegs of hard wood. One of those curious transformations
so common in savage art is seen in the case of the broad
mushroom-headed club, " Bollong." This club has been
described by Mr. Petherick, amongst the Dor tribe, as a
weapon for cracking skulls. The broad head, which is ob-
viously a monstrous development of the ordinary club head,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
appears to have suggested its employment as a seat by
sticking the pointed handle into the ground and sitting
on the head. Accordingly we find that amongst the
Dinka, Dyoor, Madi, and Gani, the upper surface of the
head has been made perfectly flat, in order to adapt it to
this new use, whilst at the same time preserving its effi-
ciency as a weapon. The wooden parrying-stick or
shield, " Kwrr," constructed of one piece with a hollow
for the hand carved out in the centre, has been noticed
by Mr. Petheiick amongst the Mundo, and is here figured
as a Dinka weapon. Its close resemblance to the Aus-
tralian parrying-shield, Tamarang, and to one from an
Egyptian tomb, now in the Louvre at Paris, has been
noticed by CoL Lane Fox in his catalogue of his collec-
tion at Bethnal Green. Dr. Schweinfurth compares it
to a specimen from the Pacific Isles now in the Berlin
Museum. Should this turn out to be correct, and not a
mistaken locality, it will add another link to the area of
distribution of this peculiar form of weapon. Parrying-
sticks, without the hand hole, are undoubtedly employed
in some of the Pacific Isles. The bow-shaped parrying-

It might be suggested as an improvement to future
travellers, that in the arrangement of the plates more
attention should be paid to varieties, and that the several
forms should be placed side by side according to their
affinities. There is no point of so great interest to the
scientific student of early culture as the allied varieties of
form. As a rule with exceptions, it may be said that arts
which are indigenous present greater varieties than those
which are exotic, and hence the importance of studying
minute differences, more especially in cases where, by
means of gradual variation, transitions to other types or
other uses may be traced. A few finished drawings are no
doubt valuable in order to give a correct idea of the leading
types ; but for the varieties, outline drawings on a smaller
scale in the style of the illustrations of " Demmin's History
of Arms," are all that is needed, and enable these transi-
tions to be given at a trifling cost. With these additions,
and with due attention to such other matters relating to
savage art as are suggested in the "Anthropological
Notes and Queries," published by the British Asso-
ciation, we would earnestly commend the example of Dr.

Schweinfurth to all travellers, for, as he truly says in his
preface, "Hurry is needed: the destructive tendency of
our industrial productions obtruding themselves upon all
the nations of the earth menaces, sooner or later, to sweep
away, even in Africa, the last remnants of indigenous
arts." Of the utility of such a work as this no anthro-
pologist or antiquary can doubt. There is, however, one
remark of the author's to which we would draw special
attention, and which he in this work reiterates with com-
mendable emphasis :—" A people, as long as they are on
the lowest step of their development, are far better
characterised by their industrial products than they are
either by their habits, which may be purely local, or by
their own representations, which, rendered in their rude
and unformed language, are often incorrectly interpreted
by ourselves. If we possessed more of these tokens we
should be in a position to comprehend better than we do
the primitive condition of many a nation that has now
reached a high degree of culture."

our estimation, that on " the movements of liquid waves,
undertaken with a view of assisting in the theory of the
pulse." Of this we will give a short account on the
present occasion.

by the graphic method, the moment of origin and the con-
formation of the wave produced in every part of an india-
rubber tube distended with fluid. A glance at the accom-
panying figure (Fig. 1.) will indicate the method employed.
The wave is produced by the movement of the piston of
the pump at the left side of the figure.
It is transmitted along the continuous
horizontal tube in the foreground,
which is made to record the move-
ments of six equidistant spots twenty
centimetres apart, on the revolving
drum, covered with smoked paper,
in the background, by means of the
delicate system of double "tam-
bours," or elastic-covered drums and
levers which have been introduced
and so much employed by the author.
The tubes connecting the tambours,
being of the same material and of
equal length, any error from irregu-
larity in the rate of transmission

along them is avoided. A pair of
forceps, as in the figure, close the
experimental tube just beyond the
point of attachment of the last of the
tambours.
When a positive wave, in other
words, one of compression, is trans-
mitted along this tube, thus arranged,
it is seen that the levers rise one after
the other, beginning at that nearest
the piston; and that immediately the
last one begins to rise, a second wave
commences in the opposite direction.
There is still more to be learnt from
the curves recorded on the smoked
cylinder, which are reproduced in
Fig. 2, from an actual experiment.
In this figure the six undulations are
those of the six levers, the lowest
being that of the portion of the tube
nearest the piston, and the highest
that of the furthest end. The trace
of a chronograph vibrating fifty times
a second is given below the lowest
of the curves. Perpendiculars pro-

jected from the summits of each of
the curves upon the chronograph
trace would be separated by equal
intervals if, during the different parts
of its course, the rapidity of trans-
mission of the wave were uniform.
But it is seen from the figure under
consideration that, although in tra-
versing each 20 centimetres of the
tube the wave takes about one-fiftieth
of a second, and so travels at the rate
of about 10 metres a second, nevertheless its rapidity is
not absolutely uniform, being at its maximum at its orifice
of entry, and after it has become slower again, slightly
increasing in velocity in the neighbourhood of the closed
end. There is therefore a double change in the velocity
of the wave.
When it has reached the extremity of the tube the wave
takes a reverse course, and returns through each of the
recording drums to the place from which it started. This
reflected wave is indicated by the down-turned arrows in

ries,* Mr, Garrod has shown that the pulse-wave augments
its rapidity as it gets further from the heart, a result which
is specially interesting in connection with those of M.
Marey on the undulations in closed tubes, the blood
system being similar in all respects.
With reference to the changes of the height of the undu-
augmentation in its rapidity. This depends on the elas-
ticity of the tube, which tends to distribute the pressure in
the different parts of the liquid column.
It will be seen from Fig. 2 that the primary direct
wave is followed by a more or less numerous series of
secondary diminishing minor waves. They are dependent
on the rapidity with which the liquid
is forced into the elastic tube. The
reflected wave may also give rise to
secondary undulations. The whole
of the foregoing results are repre-
sented in a most vivid manner by
the translation of their results stereo-
scopically or into a figure of three
dimensions, represented in Fig. 3.

We have never before seen results
of a similar kind similarly depicted.
Among the other results arrived at
by the employment of the same in-
strument, M. Marey has shown that
negative waves, that is of absorption,
obey exactly the same laws as do
positive waves, or those of compres-
sion ; also, in tubes opened at their
distant end, if the aperture is large,
no reflected wave is produced, at the
same time that the intensity of the
undulation diminishes from one to
the other end, and its rapidity also
gradually.

the general advance in intelligence which has been going

before the public in connection with the Arctic expedition,
which no doubt is now upon or beyond the "threshold of
the unknown region." He gives a short sketch of the
geographical features of the Arctic region, of its surface in
lelation to snow and ice, and of the general character of life
in the Polar World. In the second chapter an interesting
account is given of some of the most striking phenomena
tures of the region, the scenery, atmospheric phenomena,

features. The nature and formation of icebergs are pretty

Vegetable life is described in Chapter V., as also
the connections, habits, and uses of the principal Iand-
animals and birds. A slight divergence is made in

The posthumous "Notes" edited by Mr. Lloyd

another of Mr. Andersson's works, " The Lion and the
Elephant"—contain, besides the descriptions of the
habits of some few of the birds and animals of the

author during the last four or five years of his life, a
period in which the political differences between the
neighbouring South African tribes of Damaraland and
Namaqua Land compelled him to devote more time to
trade and the disputes which arose therefrom, than to
geographical and biological research.

Not long after his marriage, in 1861, Mr. Andersson
purchased of the Walwich Bay Mining Company, on the
winding up of their affairs, their extensive establishment
—Otjimbingue—in Damaraland, with the object of making
it a trading station for cattle and ivory. In a war which
arose between the Damaras and Namaquas Andersson
found himself constrained to become the leader of the
former ; during this he sustained, from a bullet, a wound
in the leg smashing the upper end of the right tibia and
fibula, which was long in healing, and rendered him lame
for the short remaining period of his life.
The great injury done to his trading operations, the loss
of his stock, and the probability of further outbreaks,
led the author, who was still suffering from his wound,
and further incapacitated by repeated attacks of dysentery,
in his enfeebled state, to entertain the idea of establishing
favourable trading relations with the Portuguese settlers
of Benguela, north of the river Cunene". With this object
in view he left Cape Town, where he had spent some
time on account of his health, in May 1S66, once more for
Damaraland. Namaqua marauders continued to harass

of a few descriptions of personal symptoms, which would
have been much better left out, Mr. Andersson's "Notes
on Travel in South Africa" forms an interesting and
instructive volume to the general reader, as well as the

A New Cetacean from New Zealand
I have just received from Dr. Julius Von Haast of Canter-
bury, New Zealand, for presentation to the Zoological Society,
an account of what appears to be a new species of Ziphioid
Whale.
As far as can be at present ascertained, for, unfortunately, the
heads only of three individuals, and these not in a perfect state,
were obtained, it is nearly allitd to the genus Mesoplodon,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
Gervais, but differs from the known species in the possession of
a row of small pointed, conical, recurved teeth, about twenty in
number, in the hinder part of the upper jaw, in addition to the
usual single large tooth, placed near the middle of the ramus of
the mandible. This is a very interesting circumstance as con-
necting the peculiar dentition of the ziphioids with that of the
ordinary dolphins.
Another fact, new in the history of the Cetacea of this group,
is that they belonged to a shoal of twenty-eight, all stranded
together on one of the Chatham Islands, whereas all previously
recorded examples have been either solitary or in pairs. It is
evident that the attention which the naturalists of New Zealand
are paying to the Cetacea, will throw much light on the history
of the order, and it is to be hoped that they -will persevere in
collecting and preserving every specimen which may come
within their reach. Dr. Haast's paper will be read at the next
meeting of the Zoological Society. W. H. Flower
Evidences of Ancient Glaciers in Central France
My attention has been recently called to a communication
on the above subject which appeared in Nature, vol. xiii.
p. 31, from Dr. Hooker. Not having myself observed any
traces of glacial action in the Mont Dore, and finding that
M. l'Abbe Lecoq, whose examination of every portion of the
district was most painstaking and exhaustive, has declared his
conviction that no such traces exist, may I be permitted to

remark that the evidence produced by Dr. Hooker does not
appear very conclusive on the question? It consists of the occur-
rence of some large fragments of trachyte in the floor of the
valley in which the Dordogne takes its rise, "the head of which
occupies a noble amphitheatre immediately under the highest
summit of Mont Dore," which " seen from a height above, were
presumably huts, haystacks, or glacially transported blocks"
The next day the doctor descended into the valley for a fuller
examination of these blocks, and found himself "amongst a
group of magnificent boulders that had evidently been deposited (?)
by an- ancient glacier which had flowed from the rocky amphi-
theatre at the head of the valley ;" "others were seen further
down the valley, its stream meandering among the blocks."
Now this description together with all that follows, and which
I need not quote, strongly reminded me of a large assemblage of
djbris of trachytic rocks which on my last visit to the Mont Dore
in i860, I observed exactly in the position indicated by Dr.
Hooker in the valley of the Dordogne, and which had been the
result of a prodigious landslip or fall of a huge slice of the cliffs
above, nearly a thousand feet high, forming the left flank of the
valley as we look up it extending for upwards of half a mile.

My own early experience suggested a solution. Might I
not deliver some well advertised public scientific lectures of a
sufficiently light and sensational character to captivate the intel-
lect by the natural bait of wonderment? If so, the systematic
classes might be fed by their means.
My first idea was, considering the poverty of the Institute at
that time, to charge twopence or threepence for admission to
such lectures, but on communicating my scheme to Mr. Arthur
Ryland, the Vice-President of the Institute, he improved it
materially by suggesting that the charge for such lectures should
be one penny, and that they should be called " Penny Lectures."
The Council assented to this, and on Jan. 22, 1S56, I com-
menced the first course of Twelve Penny Lectures in the Lecture
Theatre, Cannon Street.
The lecture theatre was crowded throughout the course, which
served its intended purpose of supplying an outline of the grasp
of Physical Science. This course was followed by others. I
continued them every Tuesday evening during above nine months
of each year until July 1863, when I left Birmingham. They
were always well attended but with some degree of fluctuation.
The smallest attendance was during a course on the Birmingham

manufactures, and the best attendance when subjects connected
with combustion, electricity, or my own travelling experiences
were treated and well illustrated.
I do not at all presume to describe these lectures as nearly
equal to the Manchester lectures that have been lately delivered.
They were necessarily extemporised, as may be supposed from the
fact that, with ihe exception of an occasional volunteer (four or
five lectures per annum), I delivered them all myself, and at the
same time conducted the Lectures on Chemistry, Experimental
Physics, Junior and Ladies' Classes, and the Practical Analytical
Class in the Laboratory, besides being compelled to supplement
my very small salary by writing newspaper articles.
1 mention this to show how much may be done by small means.
The Institute was so poor at its beginning that I was obliged to
fit the lectures to the small stock of apparatus we possessed, and
lecture on whatever subjects I could best illustrate. The average
outlay upon illustrating these early lectures did not exceed three
or four shillings each.
Nevertheless their object was fulfilled. The Penny Lectures
fed the Science Classes, which without such aliment would have
been starved and extinguished in their infancy. Their success
led to the establishment of the " Penny Readings " of the Mid-
land Institute in 1857 or 1858, which were, I believe, the first
of these entertainments that have since become so popular and
so much degenerated. These again were followed by the Penny
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Arithmetic Classes and the other Penny Classes which have since
formed one of the leading and most important features of good
work done and doing in Birmingham.
The egotism of the above narrative will possibly be pardoned,
seeing that the experiences of the early struggles of the Science
Classes of the Midland Institute have been so often repeated
where similar efforts have been made, and are likely to be
continued so long as the prevailing inefficiency or total absence
of scientific instruction in our primary schools remains. The
success of these Penny Lectures, in spite of all their shortcomings,
in creating a demand for more thorough instruction indicates an
available means of rendering science classes successful in other
places. My advice to all concerned in the promotion of such
classes is that they should make no compromise in reference to
the classes themselves, by attempting to bring in them the sub-
jects down to the level of present requirements of the majority,
but that instead of this, they should, by means of very
popular, attractive, aye, even sensational public penny lectures,
excite curiosity, and create an interest in science among those they
desire ultimately to teach.

important contributions to our knowledge of the variable
stars, the eighth of a series commenced in No. 1628, ten
years since. The observations discussed in the last com-
munication were chiefly made in 1874, but there are also
observations of several objects to the middle of the present
year. In the comparisons of the observed epochs of
maxima and minima with those calculated, the elements
in Schonfeld's second Catalogue (Manheim, 1875), which
should be in the hands of every observer of variable stars,
have been employed, while in a few cases new elements
are given.
Mira Ceti was at minimum 1874, Nov. 20 (mag. 8-6),
and at maximum 1875, March 4 (mag. 2-j), the latter being
about eight days later than is deduced from Argelander's
formula of sines.—T Tauri, the star adjoining the variable
nebula in Taurus (Hind, 1852), has exhibited irregular
fluctuations between the years 1868 and 1875 ; previous
to 1868 it had occasionally been as bright as 9-5, but
according to Schonfeld's observations since that year, it
has not been higher than io-3, while at a maximum, 1871
Nov. 25, it was only i2-o, and at another very certain

one, 1874 Feb. 10, it was 117. Schonfeld states that the
nebula of 1852 was invisible in the Manheim refractor
(6'5 inches aperture) during the whole period 1868-75,
while the small nebula detected by Mr. Otto Struve im-
mediately preceding this was only occasionally glimpsed.
This spot requires to be closely watched with large instru-
ments.—U Geminorum was satisfactorily observed at a
maximum, 1874 Feb. 4-4 (mag. 9/6), m days after the
preceding one; another maximum may be expected at
the beginning of January next, or possibly in the last
days of the present month; since the discovery of this
star in 1855, it has shown variation of period between
about 70 and 150 days.
R Crateris, the star following a, which Sir John
Herschel describes (Cape Obs., p. 448) as of " a most in-
tense and curious' colour," and "scarlet, almost blood
colour," has exhibited during the last ten years a slight
variation estimated from 8"2 to 8-o mag., but the obser-
vations have not afforded any epoch to assist in deter-
mination of elements.—S Virginis has been twice
observed by Schonfeld at minimum viz., 1874, April 20
(mag. i2-5), and 1875, April 26 (mag. 12-4), which he
believes are the first minima yet secured; at certain
maxima this star becomes distinctly visible without the
telescope (mag. 57).—x Cygni attained a maximum 1874,

Cygni; this epoch is upwards of two months later than
the date assigned by Argelander's formula in the Bonn
Observations, vol. vii., but the extreme difference between
the formula and observation appears to have occurred in
1870, when it exceeded three months; the star must be
near a maximum at the present time.—R Vulpeculae : the
further observations support the addition of the term
depending on Ea introduced in Schonfeld's last cata-
logue ; he remarks that a uniform period would involve
differences from the observed epochs amounting to twenty-
two days, while these epochs are uncertain to three days
at the most.—S Pegasi. This star, detected by Mr. Marth
at Malta, 1864, Nov. 24, when its magnitude was 8-3, was
at maximum 1874, July 8 (mag. 7.3): it must not be con-
founded with the star which first appeared upon our list
of variables as S Pegasi, the insertion of which probably
arose from an error of observation. The position of the
variable for i876-o is in R.A., 23b. 13m. 46s; N.P.D.,

The two days allowed for the examination in practical
work in the second part of the examination is scarcely
sufficient, and as the number of candidates increases,
more time will certainly be required. The Board recom-
mends some alterations in and additions to the regulations
for the Natural Sciences Tripos, which will accomplish
the object it has in view."
The Biological Schools of the older Universities, on
account of their recent origin, are still in a far from
settled state. Men who have had a previous education
in some other medical school enter as undergraduates,
and on more than a single occasion these have had the
opportunity of demonstrating to the less highly educated
of their year how gTeat is the value of a knowledge of
human anatomy, and how excellent a scientific training
it forms.
The Board of Natural Science Studies at Cambridge
mention as the first claim in favour of the greater stress
which it desires to lay on anatomy, that medical students
suffer from its omission, and are tempted to delay their
special work. We are not among those who believe that

the Universities will ever form good medical schools.
The advantage of the University curriculum is that it
prolongs the higher education through the period during
which the mind is acquiring its reasoning powers, and, as
a result, tends to strengthen these by continually vary-
ing the material to be reasoned on. Except as far as the
production of teachers of the subjects it inculcates are
concerned, it has not, and ought not to have, any direct
ulterior objects in view. If medicine is to be specially
studied we see no limits to the extension of the subjects
embraced within it. The practice of medicine by most is
hardly more than a trade, and why, as such, it should
be more highly favoured than any other special training it
is difficult to understand.
The arguments in favour of making human anatomy a
part of the biological education are of a very different
nature, and are insuperable. The study of zoology may
be commenced at either end, with the simplest protozoa, or
with a foundation of human anatomy. Both of these have
their advantages. A glance at the previous education of
those who are, at the present day, devoting themselves to
the subject, shows that almost all who commenced it
after having mastered human anatomy, have devoted
themsetves to the vertebrate sub-kingdom ; whilst those
who have commenced without any or with but little know-

ledge of anthropotomy, have taken to the invertebrata.
The intricacy of the higher forms, and the standard of
comparison afforded by the structure of the human frame,
naturally leads to a comparison of this with those of its
closest allies, and consequently places the vertebrata in a
more favourable position for investigation. It also helps
to develop a greater interest in human anatomy from the
light thrown on it by those of less elaborate organisation.
The student who commences with the lowest sub-king-
doms has to acquire his training as well as his facts from
the simpler forms, amongst which there is so little corre-
lation that he is led to lay little stress on that general uni-
formity of t)pe which seems to him to detract from the
interest of a group apparently presenting so little variety
among its different members.
Under the existing system, therefore, the tendency of
the University education is to develop invertebrate rather
than vertebrate zoologists, and this condition is capable
of being modified in the direction of improvement by the
introduction of human anatomy into the biological curri-
culum; for then those who take up such subjects might

THE VOYAGE OF THE "CHEVERT" TO NEW
GUINEA
A/TR. WILLIAM MACLEAY, of Sydney has, in a letter to
the Sydney Herald, given an account of his expedition to
New Guinea, an abstract of which, though so small in its results,
will no doubt interest our readers.
The Cheuert sailed from Port Jackson on the 18th of May
last with a crew of twenty, together with a doctor, four zoologi-
cal and three botanical collectors, Captain Onslow, and Mr.
Macleay. The ship was fitted up chiefly with the object of
making collections in all branches of Natural History in the
islands of Torres Straits and in New Guinea.
The voyage from Sydney to Cape York occupied a month, five
days being spent in the Palm Islands, and six at Cape Grenville.
On the 4th of June a stoppage was made at Brookes Island, and on
the next day on the north-west of the North Barnard Isles, in
the latter case with the object of getting a species of Ptiloris
peculiar to the island, and Mr. Masters was so fortunate as to
procure a male and two female specimens in the course of the
afternoon. The next stage was Fitzroy Island, where a few
birds were obtained; but much progress was prevented by the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
dense brushwood, which was also found in Palm Island.
On the next day the Cheverl anchored off a low wooded sand-
bank, marked on the chart "Low Wooded Isle." It was sur-
rounded by an extensive coral reef, the first seen on the voyage.
They afterwards reached Turtle Reef, opposite the Endeavour
River, passing a belt of country on the mainland which looks
very promising. A belt of low land near the coast was backed
up by steep hills of about 2,000 feet elevation, the whole densely
wooded, with numerous landslips, showing a dark red soil. On
June 8th, Number 4 Howick Group was reached, after passing a
mainland which consisted, for a long distance back, of bare
sandhills with elevated patches, forming Capes Bedford, Flattery,
and Lookout. The next stage was Flinders Island, near which
the land is very rough and rocky. Two days took them to Cape
Grenville, where they supplied themselves with water. The
weather being stormy and wet, not many specimens were pro-
cured. The land in the neighbourhood is the most barren that
can be imagined. The rock is a kind of metamorphic sand-
stone, with sometimes a sub-horizontal stratification, quite ver-
tical on the hills, with sharp laminated edges. The vegetation
is scanty, the lower hills being clothed with coarse grass, dwarf
grevilleas, &c.; the higher ranges being thinly clothed with
acacias, banksias, and pandanus; the declivities and gullies
alone being densely wooded ; whilst near the water's edge the
mangrove predominates. The natives are tolerably numerous,

and for Australians above the average, well grown and deve-
loped. They know a little English, can appreciate tobacco and
biscuits, and are good workers. They adopt the practice of
cutting the ear-lobe into .thin strips, as do the natives of Cape
York, the islands of the Torres Straits, and New Guinea.
On the 18th of June, after sailing through Albany Passage,
the Chevtrt anchored in Mud Bay. The settlement of Somerset,
of which some years ago the Government had hopes, has proved
unsuccessful, except as a pearl fishery, on which occupation
about 700 men are employed. The fishing-ground lies almost
entirely to the west of Cape York, and extends from Endeavour
Straits and the Gulf of Carpentaria northwards to thej very
shores of New Guinea. Diving dresses are much employed in
the fishery.
The vessel was detained in Mud Bay till June 26th for the
Sydney mail. Not much collecting-work was accomplished in
the densely-wooded, but pauvre neighbourhood, which is entirely
composed of a very hard ferruginous sandstone. She then took
a course due north to Warrior Island, a distance of sixty miles,
stopping off the Sue Islands, where the anchorage is perfectly
covered with masses of the young pearl shells. Warrior Island

The island is about six miles long, picturesque, and healthy-
looking. The soil is rich, and the plantations of the natives are
numerous. The geological formation consists entirely of_ a
calcareous sedimentary rock, containing numerous remains
closely resembling recent forms. The appearance of the opposite
shore of New Guinea is very different from that at Katow.
Mangrove swamps are intersected by salt-water creeks, with low
ranges of well-wonded open forests behind ; beyond which the
country seemed to become very rough and mountainous, with a
stupendous mountain chain, on a clear day distinctly visible from
the magnificent peak of Mount Yule on the west, to Mount
Owen Stanley on the east. The natives of the country here-
abouts are light-coloured, of medium size and active. Their
hair is not woolly, and is generally worn long, being tied up in a
chignon behind. They do not use tobacco, but chew the betel
They wear a very tight belt, carrying a small piece of

ones are tolerably good-looking ; they wear showy loin dresses,

houses are clean, and generally on sloping ground ; they have a
house in every village for the reception of guests ; their mutual
relations seem most friendly. They pay considerable attention
to cookery, and manufacture pottery, cloths, and nets of excellent
quality.
Mr. Macleay remained on Yule Island until Sept. 2, collecting
and exploring. No Birds of Paradise were obtained, although
many plumes were seen in the hands of natives. No Tree
Kangaroo nor Cassowary was seen. He then, on account of

Dr. George Bennett, of Sydney, has been in correspondence
with Signor D'Albertis, the Italian naturalist now residing on
Yule Island, off S.E. New Guinea. From him we learn that Sig.
D'Albertis is on most friendly terms with the islanders ; that he
has made several excursions on to the main land, though in so
doing he has been much delayed on account of his boat having

been stolen by four of his own men. He afterwards, however,
managed to purchase a canoe, and has visited five villages, the
language of the natives of which he can now speak pretty well.
On the coast he finds a fauna and flora much resembling North
Australia, but inland, on the mountains, the Papuan vegetation
predominates. He h;'.s succeeded in obtaining a perfect specimen
of his new bird of paradise, Paridisia raggiana, and has shot a
second specimen of the ground tree-kangaroo, Dorcopis lucluosa.
His health Is excellent; but an Italian companion has suffered
from fever and slight sunstroke.
Lieut. Cameron has earned a high place as an explorer by
the work which he has so successfully and so quietly accom-
plished. It will be remembered that Cameron was sent out in
1873 to find Livingstone, whose fate was then unknown. On
his way to Tanganyika he learnt the fate of the great traveller,
but continued westwards and determined to carry out an explora-
tion on his own account. After surveying a great part of Lake

A telegram from Naples, Dec 19, states that Prof. Palmieri
reports from the observatory near Vesuvius that fire has appeared
in the interior of the crater, and expresses his opinion that an
eruption of long duration may be expected. A volume of black
smoke rose from the volcano on the morning of the 19th. A
telegram of the 20th states that the fire in the crater is gradually
increasing in strength, and that the instruments of the observa-

A Reuter's telegram of Dec. 21 states that the New York

During the recent heavy floods, the low-level districts of

of water. One of the results of the flood was the driving from
their haunts of great numbers of rats, some of which might have
been seen by railway passengers to have taken refuge in willows

of 1875 :—The survey under Dr. Hayden continued its labours of
the two preceding years in the Territory of Colorado. The
field of work during the past season was the southern and western
portions of said Territory, and including a belt, fifteen miles
in width, of the northern border of New Mexico and the eastern
border of Utah. The survey was divided into seven parties,

four of which were devoted to topographical and geological
labours, one to primary triangulation, one to photographic work,
and one to the transportation of supplies. The survey of the
southern and south-western portions of Colorado has been com-
pleted, so as to make six sheets of physical atlas, designed by
this Department, leaving unexplored only the north-western
corner thereof, which can be surveyed by a single party during
the coming year. The districts explored in the past season were
not so mountainous as those of the previous years, but were
quite remote from settlements, and in perhaps the most inac-
cessible regions of this continent. The total area surveyed is
about 30,000 square miles, portions of which were very rugged.
Much of this area is drained by the Colorado liver, and is mainly
a plateau country cut in every direction by deep gorges or canons,
the sides of which show, for geological investigations, admirable
sections of the strata forming the earth's crust. The topo-
graphy of the district surveyed was elaborated in detail by the
aid of the plane-table. The exploration of the remarkable
prehistoric ruins of Southern Colorado, glimpses of which were
obtained the preceding season, was continued with great success.
They were traced down the canons to the Colorado river in New
Mexico, Utah, and Arizona, and their connection established
with the cliff cities of the Moquis of the latter Territory.
Hundreds of cave-dwellings, of curious architecture and many
miles from water, were found in the sides of the gorges, and the

advanced in the arts of civilization than their supposed descend-
ants of the present day. Of these ruins many interesting
sketches, plans, and photographs were made, and a valuable
collecion of flint weapons, earthenware and other specimens,
was gathered. The materials thus obtained will enable the
survey to present an exhaustive report on this interesting sub-
ject. The photographer of the survey obtained a series of
mountain views on plates twenty-four inches loDg by twenty

result of the fertilisation of a carpogonium. The researches of
Reess now under consideration, those of Van Tieghem, and lastly,
those of Dr. Eduard Eidam, in the Botanisehe Zeitung, 1875,

very great caution on the results obtained recently by Mr.
Worthington Smith, and published in the Gardener's Chronicle

sUrcorai ius, Bulliard, which develops rapidly, and could be
easily obtained. The ripe spores of Coprinus slercorarius are

ellipsoidal in shape, pointed towards each pole, and average
eleven mic. mill, long by six mic. mill, broad, having a brown
episporum. Germination begins by the protrusion ot the endo-
sporium in the form of a colourless papilla at one, rarely at
both, the poles of the cell. The process is a rapid one, and at
the ordinary temperature of a room occurs in from four to five
hours after sowing. The mycelia rapidly develops and branches
frequently, so that in thiee or four days the mycelia from a
single spore will form a patch from 14 to 2 mill, in circumference.
At first the mycelium is formed of a single much-branched cell
filled w iih colourless homogeneous protoplasm, numerous vacuoles
forming in the older parts as branching proceeds. At the end
of the second day numerous transverse walls appear in the my-
celium, and a little later the hyphoe are seen to anastomose. In
from three to four days after the germination of the spores, special
bearers of minute rod-like cells appear. They are more or less
long cylindrical cells with protoplasm, and they bear at their
ends, or sometimes at the side, the short, straight rod-like cells.
These grow until they have attained a certain length, then they
divide, and the upper one drops off, a process which may be
repeated two or three times, so that at about the end of two
days, when the entire protoplasm of the bearers has disappeared,
the process stops, and then the bearers themselves may fall
off. When this occurs a little pile of about fifty to sixty rod-
like cells may be noticed. These rod-like cells might be con-

founded with conidia, but further observation has shown that they
cannot germinate, and there is now no doubt whatever that they
are sptrmatia, and therefore male cells. The youngest stage of
the fruit-bearer is a thick, more or less irregularly-shaped hypha
thread, densely filled with protoplasm, and resembling the earliest
stage of the carpogonium of Asrobolus. The next stage is the
fer'ilisation by means of the spermatia which attach themselves
to the branching sacklike structure, and as the spermatia at once
lose their contents, the empty wall contrasts strongly with the
protoplasm of the carpogonium. After fertilisation the car-
pogonium becomes more and more tortuous and branched.
The spermatia of Coprinus are therefore male cells; their
bearer the antheridium, while their function is the fertili-
sation of the carpogonium. As a consequence of fertilisa-
tion the carpogonium develops into the fruit-bearer of the
fungus. The process described by Reess will thus be seen to
have a very close resemblance to the fertilisation of the Floridteae,
such as Nemalionand Batrachospermum.—The third paper is on

Soblins of European superstition. According to Hindu doctrine
iere are ten classes of such beings, the first seven of which are
demons created aboriginally with the world or by acts of the
higher gods on whom they wait as attendants or servants re-
ceiving some share of their worship, and avenging any omission
or neglect of ceremonies due. Though not invariably, they are
for the most part evilly-disposed towards human kind. But the
last three classes of whom the paper more particularly treated,

chiefly by means of possession and wicked inspiration, every
aspect of which ancient ideas as well as of the old doctrine of
transmigration they exemplify and illustrate. They are known

of the evils and misfortunes of life were attributable to the Bhuta
influence; death from violence, evil possession, diseases in

thus be described :—When polarised light passes along the line
of the principal axis of quartz, it does not suffer double refraction
and depolarisation, but circular polarisation. The result is that
when the quartz is 1} inch thick, and placed between two Nicol's
prisms, the spectrum of the light transmitted through it exhibits
seven well defined black bands, which gradually move up or
down the field of the spectrum on rotating one of the Nicols,
returning to the same place at each half-revulution. In order to

make use of this property in measuring the wave-lengths of dif-
ferent parts of any spectrum, the lower Nicol is permanently
fixed in a mounting connected with an ivory circle, each half of
which is divided into ten large divisions, and these again into
five smaller, so that it is easy to read off to the 1 ^ part of a
half revolution. This of course corresponds to ^fj, of the in-
tervals between any two of the seven bands. Placing the circle
at the zero point, the other Nicol's prism can be rotated until
the bright line of sodium is all but invisible in the centre of total
interference of the second band, counting from the red end. The
position of all the other bands is then also definite and constant.
By using a diffraction spectroscope the: wave-lengths of all the
bands and of each -fa interval can be calculated and arranged in
a table and the smaller intervals can be filled up by interpola-
tion. There is then no difficulty in determining the wave-length
of the centre of any well-marked absorption band seen in the
spectrum of any substance which is compared side by side with
that of the quartz ; for which purpose the binocular form of
apparatus described by Mr. Sorby is the most convenient. The
number of the band counting from the red end is easily seen, and
the fractional interval is easily measured by rotating the ivory

flint (Eisenkiesel) and other jaspery rocks. In Griqualand-west,

the nucleus a peculiar body. This has the shape of two cones
with their bases in apposition. In each cone a series of stria;

radiate from the apex to the base; and between the two is an ir-
regular row of granules. From the apex of the cone there further
diverge into the protoplasm of the cell a series of lines. The
author regards these peculiar bodies as metamorphosed nuclei in
the act of dividing. He points out that the simple division of
the nucleus, as well as its complete disappearance, accompanied
by the formation of two fresh nuclei, are well authenticated modes
of behaviour of the nucleus during cell division. These two
processes can only be connected on the supposition that in the
second case the two fresh nuclei are formed from the matter of
the old nucleus. The author considers that there exist in Sela-
chians modes of behaviour of the nucleus intermediate be-
tween the two extremes mentioned above, and points out that in
the peculiar striation of the body he described there are indica-
cations of the streaming out of its matter into the surrounding
protoplasm ; while on the other hand it never completely vanishes.
It therefore affords an instance where part of the matter of the
nucleus divides and part streams out into the protoplasm of the
cell to be again collected to assist in the formation of two fresh
nuclei. The author further states that he has found other bodies
intermediate between the cone-like bodies mentioned above and

MONTEIRO'S ANGOLA
Angola ami the River Congo. By Joachim John Mon"
teiro. Two vols., with map and illustrations. (Lon-
don: Macmillan and Co., 1875.)
ALTHOUGH Angola is one of the oldest, if not the
oldest, European colony in Africa, there are pro-
bably few other discovered regions in that continent about
which English readers at least know so little, and we sus-
pect that the Portuguese themselves know even less about
its people, its productions, and its physical geography.
And yet it is about four hundred years since the Portu-
guese planted their first colony on the coast. True
there are a number of memoirs of old date, in Portuguese
and in English, relating to the country, including the
narrative of quaint Andrew Battel), who was for years a
prisoner in Angola; but these are all pre-scientific.
Recent travellers have told us a good deal about the
lower Congo, and Burton, as we recently noticed, made
brief visits to some cf the Portuguese settlements further
south, and in his own way has told us much worth know-
ing. Henceforth, however, there can be no doubt that

Mr. Monteiro's work will be regarded as the authority on
the country, more especially when it is supplemented by
the various memoirs on the natural history of Angola
which he has contributed to the proceedings of the Lin-
nean and other societies, and to scientific journals. Mr.
Monteiro spent many years in the country, evidently in
connection with mining operations, and during that time
had opportunities of visiting and exploring most if not all
of the principal districts from the Congo to Mossamedes,
frequently penetrating many miles inland. Mr. Monteiro
is an Associate of the Royal School of Mines, and his
work proves him to be well qualified not only for geogra-
phical exploration, but for the investigation of the natural
history and physical conditions of a country. He is
evidently quite at home in geology, zoology, botany, and
meteorology, and has a skilled eye for the points which
a traveller ought to note in the natives whom he visits.
To the natural history of the country, our naturalist
readers no doubt know, Mr. Monteiro has made several
important contributions. On the Portuguese settlements
and colonists, on the various native tribes, on the geogra-
phical and physical features, and on the natural history
of Angola the work before us contains such abundant
information, that no one but a specialist need go further
to obtain a satisfactory knowledge of the country in all its

aspects. Mr. Monteiro writes in a simple, straightforward
style, indulges but little in speculation, conjecture, or

a full and trustworthy account of Angola is concerned, it

The name Angola Mr. Monteiro applies to all the
country from the Congo to Mossamedes, a distance of
about nine degrees of latitude. On the north, however,

With regard to the almost hopeless stupidity of the
negro, the author gives a curious instance. He employed
a number of natives while mining malachite at Bembe-

the pick and shovel, and the wheelbarrow was a special

manner in which I saw it used, was once where a black

another in front was walking backward, and turning the
wheel round towards him with his hands."
The following bold and ingenious theory as to the
character of the native Africans is at least worthy of con-

not so much by the presence of positively bad, as by the
absence of good qualities, and of feelings and emotions
that we can hardly understand or realise to be wanting in
human nature. It is hardly correct to describe the negro
intellect as debased and sunken, but rather as belonging
to an arrested stage. There is nothing inconsistent in
this; it is, on the contrary, perfectly consistent with what
we have seen to be their physical nature. It would be
very singular ndeed if a peculiar adaptation for resisting
so perfectly the malignant influences of
the climate of tropical Africa, the result
of an inferior physical organisation, was
unaccompanied by a corresponding infe-
riority of mental constitution. It is only
on the theory of 'Natural Selection, or
the survival of the fittest' to resist the
baneful influence of the climate through
successive and thousands of generations
— the 'fittest' being those of greatest
physical insensibility — that the present
fever-resisting, miasma-proot negro has
been produced, and his character can only
be explained in the corresponding and
accompanying retardation or arrest of de-
velopment of his intellect."

a very clear account of the physical con-

variety both north and south, and from
west to east. Contrary to the generally-

NATURE
Congo to Mossamedes no dense forest is seen from the

dreds of miles to the Orange River. A little mangrove,
lining the insignificant rivers and low places in their
vicinity, is all that varies the open scrub, of which the
giant Adansonios and Euphorbias have taken, as it were,
exclusive possession. Nowhere on the coast is seen more
than an indication of the wonderful vegetation, or varied
beauty and fertility, which generally begins at a distance
of from thirty to sixty miles inland.
"At this distance, a ridge or hilly range runs along the
whole length of Angola, forming the first elevation; a
second elevation succeeds it at about an equal distance;
and a third, at perhaps twice the distance again, lands us
on the central high plateau of Africa."
Each of these successive elevations is accompanied by
a corresponding change in the character of the vegeta-
tion. This varied vegetation Mr. Monteiro describes

with considerable minuteness as he'makes his way from
the Congo to Mossamedes, stopping at many places to
make minute explorations of the country around. As we
have said, Mr. Monteiro has chosen the Congo as the
northern boundary of Angola, because it presents a well-
marked line of division in respect of climate, fauna,
nature, and customs, between Angola and the rest of the
west coast. He refers to some very remarkable facts in
confirmation of this. The Congo is the southern limit of
the gorilla and of several species of monkeys and even
of birds, butterflies, and insects. He says truly that it
would well repay a naturalist to investigate the number of
species the Congo cuts off; it is a pity he had not time
to undertake the work himself; no one could be more
competent.
With regard to the universal fetish;sm of the natives,

Mr. Monteiro gives abundant information, much of which
we are sure will shed a new light on this degrading and
depressing superstition. It seems almost impossible to
eradicate it. Many of the Angolan tribes were converted
and educated by the old Portuguese missionaries, and to
this day many of the tribes transmit the " trick," as Mr.
Monteiro calls it, of reading and writing. But this seems
to have had no effect in abolishing fetishism, but on the

contrary has rather furnished it with new materials on
which to flourish. In some respects fetishism seems to
resemble the Polynesian " tabu." "Fetish " is often used
as equivalent to charm or magic, and many objects are
used by the natives to carry about with them to be used
as charms against evil, and in some places rude houses
are built as a dwelling for a fetish, who may be repre-
sented by a rude image. But besides this it is possible
to fetish a person, or thing, or.animal, in the same way as
in some of the Pacific Islands certain objects may be
tabu. Certain animals ate fetish, and these a native dare
not injure; and indeed it seems possible and easy to
render anything whatever fetish, and once at least Mr.
Monteiro took legitimate advantage of the custom for his
own protection. Their fetishes have, however, no power
for good or evil over the white man, who belongs to
another and more powerful god than do the natives, who
themselves received the idea of God or Creator from the
Portuguese missionaries.
The Celis and Mucclis, tribes dwelling inland from
Nova Redondo to the north of Bcnguella, are, Mr.
Monteiro believes, the only cannibals in Angola; the

About Mossamedes the Welivitschia tnirabilis is found
growing, and the country about the river San Nicolau,

Pyrology; or, Fire Chemistry. By Major W. A. Ross,
R.A. (London : E. and F. N. Spon, 1875.)
THE first of these volumes is a third edition of a well-
known little work, the second edition of which was
published in 1864. We think that it still holds its place
as the best elementary book on the application of the
blowpipe to the determination of minerals, although but
few changes have been made in the text.
Major Ross's work on " Pyrology" is an imposing volume
illustrated with coloured lithographs. The preface looks
more like an article in a well-known daily paper than the
opening of a scientific treatise, for in the space of a few
pages the names of Neri, Cassius, Pattinson, Herbert
Spencer, Bacon, Sir W. Hamilton, Hume, Kant, Mrs.
Marcet, Walpole, Bonaparte, Grimaldo, and Hook are
alluded to, often in a flippant and tiresome way. The
introduction is much in the same style, and we are told
that "precisely the same operations of the mind are
necessary to analyse a murder or a miracle as a mineral,"
and that "the general, the detective or the logician
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
deduces probabilities from facts . . . and the physicist or
pyrologist has first to elicit facts, which he calls reactions,
from which probabilities are concluded." A passage
which occurs on page 10 deserves notice. In it the author
states that "the various spectra in the orange, green,
violet, and indigo, &c, are due to the vapour of substances
composed of combinations of hydrogen, oxygen and
carbon, and thus that such lines seen in the solar spec-
trum should scarcely without further evidence be, as they
now generally are, attributed to the vapour of burning
terrestrial metals in the solar photosphere, but that our
metals should rather be supposed to be composed of
these elements in different proportions." Spectroscopists
will hardly consider the evidence he adduces in support
of this hypothesis to be satisfactory, for it rests on no
better foundation than the fact that when small frag-
ments of zinc, lead, silver, aluminium and other metals
are heated before the blowpipe flame in a bead of phos-
phoric acid each metal with the exception of tin, gold,
platinum, and mercury is decomposed into a brick-
red oxide, a brownish black gelatinous mass, and

disgusting smelling precipitate of sodium sulphide is

phide is a black substance insoluble in water. There are
a few well executed coloured lithographs, but the wood-
cuts, of which there are about forty, are very rough.
So much care and labour have evidently been bestowed
on the preparation of the book, that we regret to be com-
pelled to speak of it in terms of but faint praise. It is the
work of an earnest enthusiast who has discovered some
pretty reactions which might have at once become gener-
ally useful, had they been set forth in a clear and concise
form.

minerals in the Museum at Melbourne will |be
much enhanced by the publication of this descriptive
catalogue, which has been drawn up by Mr. Ulrich

somewhat upon the model of the catalogue illustrating
the collections in the Museum of Practical Geology in
London. We learn from Mr. Newberry's preface that
it originally formed part of the Report of the Museum
presented to Parliament in 1874, and it is now reprinted
with a view of making it more generally useful. Judging
from the catalogue itself, we should say that the collec-
tion of rocks and minerals from the province of Victoria
must be of an exhaustive character; the varieties are
abundant, and embrace rocks of nearly every known
description.
In drawing up this catalogue, the author has not
neglected the geological conditions under which the speci-
mens have been originally found; and along with the
several varieties of granitic, plutonic, volcanic and sedi-
mentary rock-specimens are also described the distribu-
tion and characteristics of the masses from which the
specimens have been collected, together with their eco-
nomic uses. In this part of his work the author has
availed himself of the maps and reports of Mr. Selwyn,
late Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria—whose
important and successful operations in the field were
brought to a close about seven years ago, by a sudden fit
of parsimoniousness on the part of the Colonial Legisla-
ture. In describing the rocks, Mr. Ulrich has adopted

the system of classification laid down by Zirkel in his
Petrographie modified by the views of Von Cotta and
other penologists. But, however valuable such a classi-
fication may be when it is in the power of the observer to
have constant recurrence to the aid of chemical analysis,
we consider that for the field petrologist it is [only occa-
sionally available. The nice distinctions between the
several species of plagioclastic felspars are only to be
determined by laboratory analysis, and for the ordinary
observer a classification founded on the presence or
absence of quartz amongst the felspathic rocks; and on
the determination of hornblende, as against augite as the
basis of the pyrosenic rocks is sufficient. Daily expe-
rience, aided by microscopic examination, tends to show.
that definite species amongst rocks are but limited in
number, and have little connection with geological age.
On this ground we object to such terms as "diabase,"
with its several varieties mentioned in the Table of
Mixed Felspar Rocks, as well as "anamesite," " felspar
basalt," &c, though resting on the high authority of
Dr. F. Zirkel; such being simply varieties of basalt or

A Monograph of the Trogonida; or, Family of Trogons.
By John Gould, F.R.S., &c. (London: Published by
the Author, 1875.)
The completion of a second edition of Mr. Gould's
"Monograph of the Trogons," is an event which ought
not to pass by without a notice in this Journal. The first
edition of this work, published in 1838, was one of the
earliest of Mr. Gould's magnificent series. Of its fellow
Monograph, that of the Toucans, a second edition was
issued some time since, and the present work is a worthy
companion to it. During the thirty-seven years which
have elapsed since the publication of the first edition of
the " Monograph of Trogons," Mr. Gould, as his brother
ornithologists know full well, has by no means neglected
the subject, but has from time to time brought forward
descriptions of new species that have come to his know-
ledge from the more thorough exploration of the tropics
that has of late years taken place. From these, and
other sources, the number of known Trogons, which at
the time of the first Monograph was thirty-four only, has

now been increased to forty-six, of the whole of which
splendid life-sized pictures, according to Mr. Gould's
wonted practice, ate given in the present volume.
Like the Parrots, the Trogons arc widely diffused
through the tropics of both hemispheres. Though not so
strongly marked in general characters as the Psittacida:
the Trogonidas are separated from all other known birds
by the peculiar conformation of their feet, having the
first and second toes permanently turned backwards,
which is not the case in any other form of the class
"Aves." Like the Parrots, too, the Trogons are most
numerous in the New World, thirty-three out of the forty-
six species being peculiar to Central and Southern
America, whilst eleven are found in the Indian region,
and two only in Africa. As regards habits and mode of
life, there appears to be much similarity in the Trogons
of all three continents. They are universally forest-
haunting birds, inactive in habits, short in flight and
feeding, whether their prey be insect or fruit, mostly
upon the wing. Their brilliant colours offer the most
remarkable compounds of emerald green and various
shades of crimson and golden yellow, as will be suffi-
ciently apparent to anyone who turns over Mr. Gould's
splendidly-coloured plates. We must indeed congratu-

Quantities are to be seen on every market clay in St. Cruz, the
fltsh being very cheap on account of its bad and dry quality, and

I took some trouble to get those smaller 'specimens home,

marine specimens (Bay of Manila). But an accurate comparison
showed no difference at all, and therefore the changed conditions

singular that the original observations of this comet, given
in "Francisci Blanchini Veronensis Astronomical ac
Geographicae Observationes selectae" (Verona, 1737) have
not, so far as we can discover, been fully calculated. The
volume is not mentioned amongst those consulted by
Pingrd, in the preparation of his great work, the " Come"-
tographie," and is probably rare. A preliminary reduc-
tion of these observations exhibits considerable difference
from Burckhardt's parabola, and in presence of the sus-
picious indications of ellipticity, small inclination and
direct motion, it may result that Bianchini's observations
may be sufficient to add another comet of short period to
those already known—at least so far as to render probable
its having moved in an elliptical orbit of small extent, at
the time it was observed, which is about all that can be
said in the case of the comet of 1766, or of the first comet
of 1743. It is certain that it must have been very near to
the earth shortly before Bianchini discovered the comet
on April 20. In a short time we may have more to say
respecting the movements of ihis body.

The Total Solar Eclipse of 1999, August n.—In
Nature, vol. xii. p. 213, were given the elements of the
eclipse of 1927, June 28, which will be total in the north
of England, though only for nine or ten seconds even on
the central line; it is the first total eclipse that will be
visible in these islands during the ensuing century, and
there is only one other eclipse that can be witnessed in
its totality in England before the year 2000. It is that of
'999. August 11, of which we proceed to give some
account.
The elements of the eclipse are as follows :—

So far as regards this country the most favourable
locality for observation will be in the vicinity of St. Ives,
in Cornwall, which place is almost exactly on the line of
central eclipse. Taking the position of St. Ives in long.

If we found equations of reduction upon this direct cal-
culation for St. Ives, we shall have the following expres-
sions by means of which anyone who is curious in the
matter may examine the durations for such places as fall

along the pipe at A towards the bend. This force is administered
to the fluid by the curved portion of the pipe at the bend DEF;
and as the pipe is assumed to be rigid, the work of arresting the
forward velocity of the fluid throws a forward stress on the pipe
in a direction parallel to the line AC.
Let us now assume that to the right-angled bend AB we
attach rigidly a second right-angled bend, BG, as shown in Fig.
30, in such a manner that the termination of this second bend

at G is parallel to the commencement of the first bend at A.
Here I will again, for the present, deal only with the forces in
a direction parallel to the line AC.
The fluid at B has no velocity in the direction of the line AC,
and at G it has a velocity in that direction equal to the velocity
which it had at A. To give it this velocity in a forward direc-
tion (I mean forward in its original direction of motion), to
establish this forward momentum, requires the application of a
force in the direction HG; and this force is administered to the
fluid by the curved portion of the pipe at the bend IJK ; and as
the pipe is assumed to be rigid, the duty of establishing the for-
ward velocity of the fluid throws a rearward stress on the pipe

in the direction GH. Now as the forward momentum given to
the fluid between B and G in the line GH is exactly the same as
the momentum destroyed between A and B in the line AC, it
follows that the rearward stress thrown on the pipe at the bend
IJK is exactly equal to the lorward stress thrown on the pipe
at the bend DEF. Hence it will be seen that the forces acting
on the rigid pipe AG, treated as a whole, balance, so far as relates
to the forces parallel to the line AC, the original line of motion
of the fluid—the forward stress acting on the pipe at the bend
DEF being balanced by the equal rearward stress acting on the
pipe at the bend IJK. These two of the forces acting on the
pipe are shown by the arrows L and M, which, it must be
remembered, are the only forces which act in a direction parallel
to the line AC.
It will have been seen that the measure of these forces is the
amount of forward momentum of the fluid which is destroyed
or created; and from this it will be inferred that the forces will
be the same, no matter what is the radius of the curve of the
pipe, inasmuch as the curvature of the pipe does not affect the
amount of the forward momentum that has to be destroyed or
replaced in the fluid.
Let us next take the case of a bend in a pipe that is not a
right angle, as shown in Fig. 31 ; and here, as before, I only
propose to deal with the forces that operate in a direction parallel
to the line AC, that is, of the original motion of the fluid. Now
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
in this case the forward motion of the fluid is not, as in the in-
stance of the right-angled bend, entirely destroyed in its progress
from A to A; only a portion of the forward motion is checked,
and the same portion of the forward momentum destroyed; and
the force by which it is destroyed is administered to the fluid by
the curved portion of the pipe at the bend DEF, and, as in the
former case, constitutes a forward stress on the pipe in the direc-
tion of the line AC, which will bear the same ratio to the stress
which would follow from the destruction of the whole, as the
portion destroyed bears to the whole forward momentum.
Suppose to this bend we attach rigidl/ another bend BG, of
same angle, as shown in Fig. 32, so that the termination of this
Fig. 32.
second bend at G is parallel to the commencement of the first bend
at A. Here, in the portion of the pipe BG, that part of the
forward velocity which was taken away has to be again given to
the fluid ; this requires force, which is administered to the fluid
by the curved part IJK of the pipe. There is thus thrown on the
pipe a rearward stress represented by M. The force required in
the bend between B and G to reinstate completely the forward
velocity, is evidently the same in amount as the force required

turn are necessarily balanced by equal forces in the opposite
direction required to reinstate the former momentum.
It will be useful to consider more in detail the action of all the
forces operating on a fluid in a bend of 1 he pipe; and I will return
to the case of a single right-angled bend, as shown in Fig. 29.
I before spoke merely of the forces acting parallel to the line
AC, and said that the forward momentum of the fluid in that
line had to be destroyed in its passage round the bsnd DEF,
and that this must be effected by a force acting parallel to AC,
-which would throw a forward stress on the pipe, tending to force
it in the direction AC. But similarly velocity has to be given
to the fluid in the direction NB; and to do this a force must be
administered to the fluid which will cause a reaction on the pipe
in the direction BN; and as the momentum to be established in
the direction NB has to be equal to that in the direction AC,
-which had to be destroyed, it follows that the forces of reaction
upon the pipe in the directions AC and UN are equal. These
forces can be met in two ways, either by securing the bent part
of the pipe DEF so that it will in each part resist the stresses
that come on it, or by letting the forces be resisted by the ten-
sional strength of the straight parts of the pipe AD and BF

see that the tension on AD must be equal to the force acting
along AC, and the tension on BF must be equal to the
force acting along BN, so that in fact the forces brought into

play by the right-angled bend produce a longitudinal tension on
the pipe at either end of the bend equal to the force required to
destroy the forward momentum of the fluid.
Proceeding to the case cf the non-right-angled bend, as shown
in Fig. 31 : in this case, as we have seen, a portion only of the
forward momentum of the fluid in the line AC has to be de-
stroyed, also a certain amount of sideways momentum has to be
created in a direction which we may consider parallel to the line
QP ; and the composition of the remaining forward momentum

in the line AC with the created sideways momentum in the line
QP, results in the progress of the fluid along the path FB; this
partial destruction of forward momentum and establishment of
some sideways momentum are essential to the onward progress
of the fluid along FB. The bend DEF will be subject to the
Teaction of the forces necessary to produce these changes; and
either the bend may be locally secured, or the stress upon it may
be met, as in the case of the right-angled bend we have just
been considering, by a tensional drag on the pipe at either end
of the bend. There is, however, this difference between the
cases, that the force required to establish sideways momentum
parallel to QP cannot be directly met by the reaction of tension
along the line BF of the second part of the pipe; but this
force may be met by the obliquely acting tension of the
pipe BF combined with the induced tension along the pipe
AD. It is well known that in the case of a given force, such
as that we are supposing parallel to PQ, resisted by two ob-
liquely placed forces such as the tension along the lines DA and
FB, the nearer the lines DA and FB are to one straight line, the
greater must be the tension along those lines to balance a given
force acting on the line PQ. Now the less the line FB diverges

the bend divided al that point into two bends, and there joined
together by an infinitely short piece of straight pipe.
If, then, the tortuous pipe I have above referred to lus its
ends at A and B parallel to one another, as shown in Fig. 4, it is
clear that the tensional forces at its ends balance one another,
and the pipe, as a whole, does not tend to move endways.
Note B.
The law regulating these changes of pressure due to changes
of velocity can be best understood by considering the case of a
stream of perfect fluid flowing from a very gradually tapered pipe
or nozzle placed horizontally and connected with the bottom of a
cistern, as shown in Fig. 34. Let us suppose that at the points
IS and C the sectional areas of the pipe are severally twice and
four times that at the point of exit A.
At the point of exit A the fluid is under no pressure whatever,
since there is no reacting force to maintain any pressure ; each
particle of fluid in the issuing jet is rushing forward on its own
account, neither giving nor receiving pressure from its neighbours.
We know, however, what force it has taken to give the velocity
which the fluid has at the point of issue A, and we measure this
force by the pressure or head of fluid, lost. In the case we are
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
considering, this head is represented by the height of the fluid in
the cistern, or by the height AD.
Within the cistern, at the point E, on the same level as A,
the point of issue—at this point E within the cistern, we have
in effect the whole pressure due to the head of fluid equal to AD,
but we have no velocity, at any rate the velocity is so small as
to be inappreciable; and at the point of issue A wc have no pres-
sure at all, but we have what is termed the "velocity due to the
head.''
Let us suppose that at the points A, B, C, and E, gauge-
classes or stand pipes are attached so that the fluid in each may
rise to a height corresponding with the pressure within the pipe
or nozzle at the point of attachment.
The gauge-glass attached at A will show no pressure, thus
indicating that the entire head AD has been expended in pro-
ducing the velocity at the point A.
At the point B, as the sectional area is twice, the velocity is
one-half that at A. Now the head required to produce velocity
varies as the square of the velocity to be produced; in other
words, to produce half the velocity requires one quarter of the
head; thus of the whole head AD available, one quarter only,
or GD, has been absorbed in developing the velocity at B, and
the remainder of the pressure, which will be represented by the
head BG, will be sensible at the point B, and will be exhibited
in the gauge-glass attached at that point.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Again, as the pipe at C is four times the area that it is at A,
it follows that, of the whole head AD, one-sixteenth part only,
or IID, has been absorbed in developing the velocity at C, and
the remainder of the pressure, which will be represented by the
head CH, will be sensible at ihe point C, and will be exhibited
in the gauge-glass attached at that point.
In the case I have chosen for illustration, the small end, A, of
the nozzle, is open and discharging freely, and the pressure at
that point is therefore nil. But the absolute differences of pres-
sure at each point of the pipe or nozzle will be precisely the
same (as long as the same quantity of fluid is flowing through it
per second), however great be the absolute pressures throughout.
Thus, suppose that from the end of the nozzle at A a pipe of
the same diameter, and of uniform diameter throughout its
length, is curved upwards, so that the end of it, I, is two feet
higher than A, as shown in Fig. 35, if the level of the cistern is
also raised two feet, namely to the level marked J, instead of D,
we shall have the same delivery of fluid as before; and the
differences between the pressures at each point will be the same
as before.

The various publications of the Observatory are in a forward
condition. The First Melbourne General Catalogue of 1,227
Stars, for the epoch 1870, was published early in October, in
time to be distributed among the different parties charged with
the observation of the transit of Venus, by whom its great utility
was acknowledged.
The observatory staff had much work to do in connection with
the observation of the transit of Venus, not only having to make
the necessary preparations for observing the transit at their own
stations, but also to assist with the requisite observations for
finding the positions of the stations occupied by the different
nations in that part of the world. The arrangements made by
the Observatory were all that could be desired.
With regard to the ordinary work of the Observatory, Mr.
White reports as follows :—
"The work with the transit circle has consisted of the usual
standard stars for finding the time, and the position of the instru-
ment; c!o<e circumpolar stars, low stars for refraction, stars with
which bodies had been compared off the meridian, stars culmi-
nating with the moon, the moon itself, and stars whose places
were required by outside observers for any special purpose.

"P.D. observations.—The stars observed in 1873 are reduced
with the exception of 212, which require the corrections to reduce
them from their apparent to their mean places. Of the stars
observed in 1874, 865 are wholly unreduced, 267 have the reduc-
tions applied as far as the refraction, 45 are reduced to their
apparent places, and the remaining 45 are fully reduced. Of
the stars observed during the present year, 184 are fully reduced,
46 are reduced to their apparent places, and 122 are wholly

Breadth qf view is indeed essential, if 'anywhere, in such an
investigation as the present. A restricted insight and experience
would fail to detect and to demonstrate the substantial unity of
structure existing in the palate of Lizards and of Woodpeckers,
still more to establish the more minute relationships between
the Rhynchosaurian Hatteria and various members of the Wood-
pecker group. This is what has been done. The well-defined
group of the Woodpeckers, including the sub-family of Wry-
necks, is so connected by its embryonic and adult palatal struc-
tures with the Lizards, that the name "Saurognathre" is to be
substituted for the morphologically-unexpressive term "Celeo-
morphre," applied to them by Prof. Huxley. Their palatal
region is arrested at a most simple and Lacertian stage, whilst
in other respects they are metamorphosed and specialised beyond
any other kind of birds.
The characteristics of the Saurognathous type of palate may
be summarised as follows :—Retention and ossification of tra-
becular cornua; great number and bilateral independence of the
vomerine series of bones, some of which are azygous (vomers,
septo-maxillaries, median septo-maxillary); absence of a distinct
mesopterygoid, represented, however, by a long process; a

absence of a distinct transpalatine; abortive development of
maxillo-palatine plates, and presence of a distinct palato-
maxillary on the left side only.
One of the most instructive specimens figured is Picumnus
minutus, a woodpecker from Bahia, Brazil, of about the size of
the Golden-crested Wren. In it the vomers retain in the adult
the condition manifested in the young of the Green Woodpecker,
and much resembling the vomers of Hatteria. In other respects
it presents resemblances to various Passerines of its own zoologi-
cal area; and from it the author's imagination is led down to
extinct types in which the characters of the Hemipod, the low
Passerine, and the Woodpecker were existent in one generalised
form—a form ^and a type only a step or two above the Ostrich
tribe.
Numerous hints are given in this paper which lead us to look
with great interest for Prof. Parker's forthcoming paper on the
./ligithognathae (Passerines) in the Zoological Transactions; and we
may fitly close this notice with a pregnant passage referring to the
/Egithognathous palate, showing to what problems of surpassing
import these researches are supplying an answer. "I have long
been familiar with its more marked peculiarities; but its mor-
phological importance dawned upon me when I saw that the
parts of that complex face, so conjugated and so metamorphosed,
were really built up of elements which had their true counter-

repeat these parts from the Amphibia; and the Amphibia
borrow them from the Cartilaginous Fishes, amongst the lowest

lopment, both morphologically and functionally, of cartilages
that form the substratum of the most peculiar part of a sparrow's

74,957/. Ten years later it had advanced to 84,306/. ; in 1862 to

At the same time the cultivation of tea is advancing even
more rapidly, though its introduction is much more recent. The
Assam tree is celebrated for its fine quality. The existence of
this tea-producing country was only recognised in 1834, when
Lord Bentinck introduced some Chinese growers, and the trade
became firmly established. In 1842 the value of tea exported
was 17,244/. ; in 1852, 59,220/.; in 1862, 192,242/. ; and|in 1872,

SCIENTIFIC SERIALS
The "Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England,
Second Series, No. xxii.—The contents of this number are most
attractive. To science is assigned the leading place in the
arrangement. The first paper is devoted to the Colorado potato-
beetle, and is from the pen ol Mr. Bates, F.L.S., who does not
profess to impart any original information, and who is unable to
come to any definite conclusion as to the probability of its ap-
pearing in these countries. The paper is calculated to confuse
rather than to enlighten us on this point. For while in one
place the author goes to show that the possibility of living speci-
mens arriving here cannot be doubted, he observes elsewhere that
the analogies of the case supply ground for confidently believing
that there is exceedingly little probability of their propagating
and spreading in this country. We are also told that " the creature
has developed extraordinary flexibility of constitution and habits

since it left its quiet home in the Rocky Mountains, and that we
cannot be quite sure what it will eventually do." In another pas-
sage Mr. Bates says :—" The potato-beetle is no insidious enemy,
like the majority of insect plagues, but meets the farmer in open
fair fight." What does he mean by a fair fight between an
insect which destroys whole fields and districts, and the helpless
farmer?—Mr. Carruthers, F.R.S., consulting botanist to the So-
ciety, contributes a paper and a note on the potato disease. In the
"paper" he reports on what he calls the results of the competition
for the prizes offered through the Society in l874for potatoes which
would resist the disease for three years in succession. The "note"
gives a brief account of Mr. Worthington Smith's discovery of the
resting spore of the potato fungus. The paper must have been
written before the discovery. The truth is the discovery throws
a curicus shadow not only on the paper but on the course pursued
by the society in connection with the whole subject. We were
not quite prepared to find that the consulting botanist of this great
society would be permitted to nnnounce, as he hac done in this
paper, that in investigating this disease we must summarily dismiss
the soil from our consideration. "Neither soil, nor methods
of cultivation," we are told, "exercise any influence on the pre-
valence of the disease." For the present we can only say
these statements are as unsound as they are astounding. The
Journal contains a long paper on laying down land to permanent
pasture, which is a joint production. The bulk of the infor-

mation is given second-hand; that is to say, on information
furnished by several agriculturists, a long paper is based by the
joint authors. The number contains too much matter of this
character. The views of an American naturalist on the Colorado
potato-beetle are given in a paper by Mr. Bates. Mr. Carru-
thers seeks to enlighten us on the potato disease by information
collected from various sources; and a number of scattered facts
on one of the most important of agricultural subjects—the pro-
fitableness of pasture as compared with arable land—are grouped
and reviewed in a great variety of ways, s:me of which are cal-
culated rather to mislead than to enlighten the reader. There
are several passages in the paper which will produce the im-
pression that the gentleman to whom has been assigned the chief
part of the joint authorship is not intimately acquainted with
agriculture as at present practised. We take one passage as an
illustration : " There are many persons so enamoured of a special
rotation—say the four-course—that to extend the period of arti-
ficial grass to two years appears to them a violation of all the
true principles of scientific farming. The four-course is their
ideal of modern farming. A course of cropping which has

has had dissimilar poles. By meditating upon certain facts
connected with this subject, I concluded that, by passing a current
from one end to the other of a magnetized rod or wire having
similar poles at its two ends, the magnet would probably rotate,
and experiment has demonstrated that conclusion.
Upon a thin wooden tube 15 centims. long and 7 millims.
bore, I wound a cotton-covered copper wire 1' 7 millim. diameter,
from one end of the tube to the middle, then reversed the
direction of winding, and continued to the other end and back to
the middle, again reversed, and coiled to the first end of the tube;
by which arrangement the passage of a current through the coils
produced two s-imilar poles at the ends of the tube, and two
others of the opposite kind at the middle.
The tube being now fixed in a vertical position, a straight fron
wire 15 centims. long, and 1*8 millim. diameter, pointed at its
lower end, and surmounted by a brass mercury cup 5 millims.
diameter, containing a drop of mercury, was supported entirely
within the tube and free to rotate, by a similar cup (surmounting
a fixed vertical brass rod), at the lower end of the tube; the
upper end of the axial wire being kept in position by a vertical
brass rod fixed above the coil and terminated at its lower end
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
by a sharp point of platinum in the mercury cup.
A current from 6 one-pint Grove's elements, arranged as 3,
being now passed through the coil, brass rods, and axial wire, the
latter rotated rapidly.
A copper wire substituted for the iron one would not rotate,
probably because copper is so little capable of acquiring longi-
tudinal magnetism.
To ascertain if the coil-current simply performed the function
of longitudinally magnetizing the axial wire, I took an iron
wire 23 centimes, long and 2 7 millims. diameter, sharp-pointed
at its lower end; soldered to its upper end a double wire of
cotton-covered copper, each wire being 1 '7 millim. diameter,
coiled the double wire upon the axial rod in two layers, and so
as to enable two similar poles to be formed at the extremities of
the axis, and terminated the copper wires by a little brass
mercury-cup just above the top end of the vertical iron axis. By
supporting this apparatus as the axial wire in the previous
experiment, and passing the current, rotation occurred.
Reversing the direction o( the current did not reverse the
direction of rotation.
These experiments, produce a striking effect in a lecture, be-
cause the rotation appears to be produced without reaction of the
moving part of the apparatus upon any external or fixed body.
In each of these cases of rotation, an upward vertical current
entering a lower south pole or leaving an upper one, caused the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
upper end of the rod to rotate in the direction of the hands of a
watch, and a downward current entering or leaving a north
pole also produced that direction of motion, and reversing the
poles in cither case reversed the effect.
In each of tht.-e instances of rotation, without the aid of a
current near the middle of the magnet, the coil being so con-
structed that the current in it could not be reversed without
reversing that in the fixed conductors near it, reversing the
direction of the current did not reverse that of the rotation,
because the two acting influences were rever.-ed together, and
therefore each apparatus had its own direction ot rotation,
either right handed (^^) or left handed, * according to the direc-
tion in which its coils were wound. It follows from this that
a current, the direction of which is alternately reversed, will
drive the apparatus quile as well as one in one uniform direction.
I now endeavour to increase the effect. F01 this purpose I
substitu'ed for the upper trass rod a fixed coil consisting of one
layer of copper wire upon an iron wire axis, but having dis-
similar poles at its ends and no poles at its middle part, and
placed between it and the lower brass rod a right-handed one
free to rotate. The opposed poles of the fixed and movable

strongly support the opinion that the rotation in the experiments
was due to the action of the portions of the current in the cups

Linnean Society, Dec. 16.—Dr. G. J. Allman, F.R.S., presi-
dent, in the chair.—The following papers were read :—On the
structure and development of the bird's skull (part II.), by W. K.
Parker, F.R.S. This and the former paper are parts of a large
piece of work done by the writer in this particular field. A
similar paper en the skull of Passerine birds appears in the
present number of the Transactions of the Zoological Society;
to be followed by another on the same subject. The writer's
wish to work out a large series of well illustrated papers on the
bird's face arose from the new interest given to this special
re search by Prof. Huxley's masterly memoir " On the Classifica-
tion of Birds" (Proc. Zool. Soc, April n, 1867), and his paper
"On the Classification and Distribution of the Alectoromorpha:"
(Ibid, May 14, 1868). The writer has worked out this subject
in two ways, viz., by exhaustive work at one type of skull,
making research in every part, and also by taking a part of the
skull,lthe fore-face, and comparing this part in many types. The
present paper is a piece of the latter kind of work, but begins with

some new embryological details to serve as a supplement to his me-
moir on the fowl's skull (PhiL Trans., 1869) ; and this especially
with regard to tliedevelopment of that most interesting but puzzling
bone, the " columella amis." This is shown to be developed in
the house-martin (Chtlidon urbica) in the same manner as in the
reptilia. As Prof. Huxley sought, in his memoir, to give a mor-
phological classification of birds based on the cheeks and palate,
it_has been the wish of the writer to carry on his friend's work,
and to test it as well as extend and give it form and body. In the
present paper the meaning of the peculiar structure of the face in
crows, sparrows, warblers, &c. (Prof. Huxley's Coracomorpha;),
is sought to be made plain by reference to the development and
metamorphosis of the parts. In these the single vomer of
the adult is shown to b: constructed out of four bones
and two cartilages; and all this composite structure is
seen in them to be fused with the nasal capsule. This form
of face, the most specialised of any of the class is called the
"Gigithognathous " face or palate ; and the huge army of birds
possessing it are called "CEgithognatha'." Thus we have two
terms for the group; first, a zoological "Coracomorpha; ;"
and second, a morphological "CEgithognatha:;" and these two
groups are almost superimposable. In other birds, however, with
open palates, the " Schizognatha;;" or with strongly closed and
united palates, the "Desmognathaj," the zoological and morpho-
logical groups are not capable, in many instances, of being laid

fairlv the one on the other. Prof. Huxley put the Goatsuckers
and Humming-birds amongst his " CEgithognatha;;" in the present
paper they are shown to be as truly schuignathous as the Fowl
or the Plover. In this japer the skull of these two types is
largely illustrated. Many kinds of the desmognathous type of
palate are described and figured.and their varieties explained. This
is largely done with the birds of prey, amongst which the writer
puts the Cariama (Dicholophus). Lastly, the schizugnathous face is
illustrated in the skull of the Sea-mew. Birds of the Gull tribe
are shown to arise from the specialisation of the Plover type;
they are a high kind of Charadrian bird. An interesting dis-
cussion followed, in which Dr. P. L. Sclater and Dr. Murie took

LAS LETT'S " TIMBER AND TIMBER TREES"
Timber and Timber Trees, Native and Foreign. By
Thomas Laslett, Timber Inspector to the Admiralty.
Crown 8vo, pp. 352. (London: Macmillan and Co.
1875O
IN all parts of the world where the vegetation partakes
of an arboreous character, the wood is applied by
the natives either for building their huts or houses, for
their canoes or war-vessels, or for various domestic pur-
poses, according to the extent of civilisation under which
they live. This universal application of timber dates
back to the earliest ages, and though the world's con-
sumption of wood has been increasing ever since, and
more especially in modern times, the supplies have never
yet absolutely failed. Though the trade in timber, pro-
perly so called, that is for building purposes as distinguished
from ornamental woods, is one of immense proportions
and great value, the more general application of iron at
the present day for constructive purposes has to some
extent, no doubt, prevented a dearth in the timber mar-
ket. Notwithstanding this substitution of iron both in
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
shipbuilding and in general mechanical work, no abso-
lute diminution in the quantities of timber imported into
this country has been effected. On the contrary, the
official returns show a gradual increase both in rough
and in planed or dressed timber, large quantities of which
now come regularly from Sweden and Norway, from
Russia, British North America, and other countries.
There are but few, if any, of our commercial articles,
whether they be of home or foreign produce, that have a
wider range ot interest or more numerous ramifications
than the wood and timber supplies. Primarily the subject
may be divided into two divisions, the first dealing with
timber as used for constructive purposes, and the second
with woods as used by the cabinetmaker or for orna-
mental work; and still another important division is that
of dye woods.
When we consider that the value of timber chiefly for
building purposes imported into this country during the
year 1874 amounted to over twenty millions sterling, it is
surprising that so little is generally known or so few
books have been written on a subject of such great com-
mercial and general importance. Besides the produce of
our own forests, composed for the most part of oak,
larch, fir, ash, beech, &c, the bulk of the wood imported
from Sweden, Norway, Russia, &c, is the produce of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
coniferous trees, the botanical origin of which are for the
most part known ; but over and above these are numerous
woods which, though they are and have been articles of
commerce for many years past, are still quite unknown
as to their botanical sources. And it is not a little
remarkable that most of these unknown woods are the
produce of some part of the South American continent.
From Brazil and Paraguay, for instance, we are constantly
receiving samples of finely-marked hard and apparently
durable woods, but no information ever reaches us of the
nature of the trees furnishing these woods. If collectors
would only bear in mind that samples of wood with native
Vol. xiii.—No. 323
names only are next to valueless, and would use every
endeavour to secure and bring home a flowering spe-
cimen of the tree producing any particular wood, they
would be helping to develop the resources of the forests,
besides contributing to the knowledge of the flora of the
country. But this is a matter which does not concern the
importer so long as the necessary supplies are forth-
coming and remunerative prices can be realised; and it

810 to 1,500 years, the yew from 1,214 to 2,820, and the
Baobab (Adansonia digitatd) to 5,coo years, the author
points out that these figures have been based upon the
general assumption of each concentric ring of wood being
the growth of one year. Speaking of his own experience, he
says:—" I have carefully examined and counted the annual
layers of a great many specimens—taking generally the
average of the trees—with theview to showthe common and
comparative rates of growth, and have tabulated them to
afford an opportunity of noticing any variations there
may have been in the time required to form the wood in
each of the several given diameters of 6, 12, 18 inches,"
&c. In these'tables it is shown that in fifteen specimens
of oak, the diameter of whose stems were in all cases
6 inches, the number of rings ranged from 12 to 49; in
the same number of sections measuring 12 inches dia-
meter they ranged from 19 to 105, and in those of 18
inches diameter from 24 to 160. In sections'of Green-
heart (Nectandra Rodiccf) of 6, 12, and 18 inches diameter,

In the matter of ordinary timber the information given
is varied and tolerably complete, and the opinions of the
author as regards strength, durability, and value for prac-
tical purposes may, of course, be taken as the opinion of
one having experience and authority to speak on such
matters. Moreover, the tables showing the breaking
weights of the different woods and their specific gravities
are the results of actual experiments. It is much to be
regretted that in a work of this kind, which has not been
produced without some care, more attention has not been
given to scientific accuracy, not only in tracing out the
sources of the woods mentioned, but also in bringing
what botanical nomenclature has been attempted down
to modern times. Thus, for instance, the "Magaran
duba" of Brazil (p. 182) might have been accredited as
being a species of Mimusops, the " Cedro," on the follow-
ing page, not as a species of "Cedar" but of Cedrela
{Cedrela odorata probably), and the " Vinhatico," (p. 186)
probably Persea indica. Again, with regard to African
oak or teak, it is stated to be "probably the Swietcm'a
senegalensis or S. Khaya" but it is well known that the
durable timber commonly known under the above names

is produced by Oldfieldia a/ricana, a Euphorbiaceous
tree. The Cuban Sabicu wood, likewise, of which the
stairs of the great Exhibition building in Hyde Park in
1851 were constructed, and which, we believe, are still in
use at Sydenham—such is the durability of the wood—is
described as being produced by Acacia formosa, but it is
under Lysiloma sabicu that any description of this wood
is to be found in works of a botanical character.
It is not with the view of depreciating the value of the
book that we point out these errors. In a new edition,
with the aid of a botanist and a determination to extend
the scope of the work so as to include all woods known
in commerce, the value of the book might be considerably
enhanced. As it is, however, besides the technical details
there are numerous interesting facts distributed through
its pages, many of which are new to.us.

As to the construction of the cams, M. Marey draws a
curve to represent the systole and diastole of the ventricle
of the actual heart, figuring it as a simple rise followed
by a less abrupt fall. He divides the linear horizontal
projection of this by twenty equidistant points, from
which he projects the same number of parallel vertical
lines, or ordinates. Taking a small board he draws on it
a circle, from the centre of which radiate twenty equi-
distant lines, of which, when one has been measured off
so as to equal in length the first ordinate of the cardiac
horizontal curve, the others are made to correspond with
the second, third, &c. On uniting by a line the extre-
mities of these rays, a closed curve is the result, which
must form the edge of the cam c.v. The cam CO. is
constructed in a similar manner from the auricular trace.

certain speed produces a compression (or systolic move-
ment) by the auricular one at the interval of time before
that of the ventricular which elapses between the systoles
of the living auricles and ventricles, then the actual
cardiac revolution is correctly imitated both in this
particular and in the relative duration of the systoles
themselves.
To verify the accuracy of the arrangements in the
above-described schema, traces have been taken from it
similar to those from the auricles, ventricles, and arteries
of the horse. Fig. 2 illustrates the actual position, in the
artificial heart, in which the elastic ampoules (sacs filled
with air) which transmit its movements to recording levers
(Fig. 3) were placed ; and Fig. 4 is a simultaneous tracing
from the four, the fourth being that of the motion of the

In Figs. 1 and 2 the proximal vessels alone are repre-
sented to save confusion.
M. Marey claims for this his new schema that with it
he can reproduce all the phenomena of the cardiac circu-
lation; at the same time that with it he can master all
the theories with reference to the significance of the most
important elements of the pulsation of the heart. In this
we think he is too sanguine ; for there are fundamental
elements of the cardiac circulation which it is quite unable
to indica'e even the existence of b ¦ means of it. One of
the most important of these is the fact that the relative
length of the systole and diastole varies with the rapidity
of the pulse, a most important point not at present suffi-
ciently laid stress on. Another is the active diastole of
the ventricle, which immediately follows the closure of
the aortic valve. These and other minor considerations
all go to prove that, though the new schema of the circu-
lation is a great improvement upon all others yet intro-
duced, nevertheless the exact representation of acts so
complicated as the systole of muscular cavities cannot
yet be imitated by the employment of the unaided

DAAtATANNS RACE-PHOTOGRAPHS
Ethnological Photographic Gallery of the Various Races
of Man. By £ '. and F. W. Dammann. (London:
Triibner and Co.)
THE science of anthropology owes not a little to the
art of photography. It is true that in previous
times some few artists took the trouble to draw careful

race-portraits. Catlin's American Indians (particularly
the large copies) and Burchell's Hottentots and Bushmen,
were among those of real value. But most engravings of
race-tvpes to be found in books were worthless, either
wanting the special characters of the race,
>r absurdly caricaturing them. Now-a-days,
little ethnological value is attached to any
but photographic portraits, and the skill of
the collector lies in choosing the right indi-
viduals as representatives of their nations.
Thus the great Anthropologisch-Ethnolo-
pitches Album of Carl Dammann of Ham-
burg, completed some months go, is one of
the most important contributions ever made
to the science of man. Consisting of fifty
plates, portfolio size, with ten to twenty pho-
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tographs on each plate, it goes far toward an
adequate representation of man in all his
varieties. A copy may be seen at the Anthropological
Institute, but its cumbrousness and cost (18/.) are beyond
the limits of most private libraries. It is therefore satis-
factory that the publishers have now brought out a smaller
educational atlas, price 3/. y., containing from I So to 200
portraits, in a binding suitable for a drawing-room book.
We wish it all success, for it will make new anthropologists
wherever it goes.
The plan on which the portraits are arranged is mainly
geographical, exact race-division being from the nature
of the case impracticable. Indeed one of the effects of
both the large and small albums will be in a negative
direction. They will do more than any quantity of written
criticism to check the rash generalisation as to race so
common in ethnological systems, and they will do this by
impressing on the minds of students .the real intricate
blending of mankind from variety to variety. It is not
impossible that some day the time may come for scienti-
fically calculating the constitution of a race, on Quetelet's

that can at present be done to define a race-type is
vaguely to make out some of its dominant features. A
good example may here be seen in Plate I., which is
headed "Germanic Types," though not consisting en-
tirely of them. The last portrait is of a Welsh market
girl, and just above her is Livingstone, who as we know
was from the Gaelic Island of Ulva. If there is such a
thing as a Keltic type, these two portraits show it; they
might very well have been father and daughter. The
contrast of the dark, near-eyed, compact-featured Welsh
girl with the fair North German peasant woman next her
is excellent, and the Bavarian lady next again shows the
difference as well as possible between South and North
German.
It is needless to enumerate the peoples of each district
of the globe who have contributed their cartes-de-visite
to this album, but a few remarks on incidental points
occur as one turns over the plates. A young newly-married
couple from China suggest an answer to the question, At
what age may ethnological poitraits best be taken? No
doubt it should be somewhere about twenty years old,

more or less, when the physical type has become deve-
loped, but the influence of thought, occupation, and cir-
cumstances have not yet masked the lines of race. In
these plates, the elderly Chinese broker and the Japanese
gentleman aged sixty-four, are in expression curiously
like what Europeans of the same age and occupations
might be. Yet when they were young, the faces of these
Orientals probably bore no such apparent European like-
ness. What an ethnologist wants is not the cast of edu-
cation and experience, but the mere national face, and
this must be taken young. Again, for contrast between
purity and mixture of nations, it is interesting to compare
Plate XI I., containing Siberian tribes of comparatively uni-
form type, with the heterogeneous figures in the n ext plate
from Morocco and Algeria. The gradual blending of
races, of which mention has been already made, may be
well studied in Plates VIII. to XI., which bring into view
better than it ever has been shown before, how the Malay
peculiarities are to be traced into the Chinese and Japa-
nese types. Lastly it may be remarked that the often-
repeated ethnological theory deriving the natives of
America from Eastern Asia, will receive but little support
from a comparison of the portraits here given from
Siberia, Japan, and China on the one hand, and North
America on the other.

1672. In 1682, he says that Grew published an enlarged edition
of this smaller work under the same title. But this is not really
the state of the case. The title of the large book is " The Ana-
tomy of Plants, with an Idea of a Philosophical History of
Plants." The volume has Sir Christopher Wren's imprimatur,
which runs as follows :—
"At a meeting of the Royal Society, Feb. 22, \(&\, Dr.
Grew having read several Lectures of the Anatomy of Plants,
some whereof have been already printed at divers times, and
some are not printed; with several other Lectures of their

"CHR. WREN, P.R.S."
The "Anatomy of Plants Begun" is simply reprinted in this
volume. "The Anatomy of Leaves, Flowers, Fruits, and
Seeds" is, however, printed for the first time. In the second
part of this, called "The Anatomy of Flowers prosecuted with
the bare eye and with the microscope," which was read liefore
the Royal Society, Nov. 9, 1676, is contained Grew's discussion

of the function of the parts of the flower in which the statement
about Millington occurs..
Grew's " Anatomy of Plants" can no more be described as a
second edition of the "Anatomy of Plants Begun" than Prof.
Huxley's "Lay Sermons" can collectively be described as a second
edition of any one essay republished in that volume.
The object of the quotation from Sprengel was to show what
was his opinion of the claims of Camerarius to be considered
the discoverer of sexuality in plants. As Mr. Bennett (vol. xiii.
p. 166) makes a point ot nothing being cited from Sprengel as
regards Millington; here is what Sprengel says on that head.
Speaking of Grew :—
"Summam vero meruit et sera; posteritatis gratitudinem, quod
primus sexuum differentiam in partibus vel fcecundantibus vel
fcecundandis non invenerit, sed tamen defenderit ac evulgaverit.
Ipse verecunde satis et candide Thomnm Millingtonium, Savi-
lianum professorem Oxonii nominat, qui sibi dixerit, apparatum
cum seminiformem (the anthers) vices partium mascularum pro-
babiliter gerere " (" Hist, rei Herb.," ii. 14).
Next as to Cameratius and Ray, Mr. Bennett says that the
observations of the first antedated those of the second by two
years. On Mr. Bennett's own showing the date of Camerarius's
tract is 1694 (Nature, vol. xiii. p. 86). The date of the first
volume of Ray's " Historia," in which he alludes to the subject,
is 1686.

As to Theophrastus it is well known that classical writers on
natural history were aware that the unisexual flowers of the date
required the "pulvis maris," or pollen, to enable them to set
their fruit. But I am not aware that till the time of Grew and
Millington the fact that the vast majority of plants contain
stamens and ovaries, i.e., both male andfemale organs, had ever
been ascertained. What these persons did for the first time was
to point out the function of the essential organs of the flower.
Mr. Bennett, instead of taking his facts secondhand from Prof.
Sachs's no doubt excellent "Geschichte," ought to have looked
into the authorities himself. He would then avoid the error of
quoting non-existent editions and of drawing conclusions which
would be inexpugnable if they were not based on erroneous
dates. A. B. C.

the following observation regarding the three-toed sloth, made

not frequently met with, namely, Baron Albert von Sack's
"Narrative of a Voyage to Surinam" (London, 1810). In
chap. xvi. at p. 170, he says :—" The colour and even the shape
of the hair are much in appearance like withered moss, and serve
to hide the animal in the trees, but particularly when it gets that
orange-coloured spot between the shoulders, and lies close to the
tree; it looks then exactly like a piece of branch where the rest
has been broken off, by which the hunters are often deceived."

Although in several Natural History Encyclopaedias Scot-

When carrying one home one evening in my open hand it

whereas I never witnessed the glow of one in summer so long

others who have continued them, we are in possession of
the dates of perihelion passage of the comet which bears
his name, from 1786 to 1875. If these be arranged and
the intervals taken between the successive dates, it will be
found that in the course of these ninety years the effect of
perturbation has not changed the period of two succes-
sive revolutions by a hundredth part. The revolution
1819-1822 was id days longer than that between 1815
and 1819, and the revolution 1845-1848 was in days
shorter than the preceding one, and these are the largest
variations exhibited. In the same period, the longest
interval between two successive arrivals at perihelion is
1215-6 days, 1842-1845, and the shortest 1200-2 days,
1868-1871.
In aphelion the distance of the comet from the orbit of
the planet Jupiter by the elements of 1875 is 0*915, too
great to allow of any violent perturbation. In about 123^°
heliocentric longitude, and 6°5o' north of the plane of
the ecliptic the comet approaches the orbit of Mercury
within 0038 ; to bring the bodies into closest possible
proximity it is necessary that the planet shall arrive at
perihelion 12J days before the comet, and we know that
a very close approach to this condition took place in
November 1848, whereby, on the 22nd of that month, the
comet was brought within 0-0378 from the planet, a
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
distance of about fifteen times that which separates the
moon from the earth. A close encounter with Mercury
appears hardly possible before the year 1904.
If the orbit of Encke's comet was fixed within its
present comparatively restricted limits by planetary
attraction, it seems quite as likely that this may have been
occasioned by an extremely close approach to Mercury as
that Jupiter at some distant period should have been the
disturbing agent.

thing to this effect: 'Oh then, the way to find what sub-
stances are present in the sun and stars is to find what
substances give bright lines coincident with the dark
lines of those bodies.' I thought he was generalising too
fast; for though some dark lines might thus be accounted

for, I was disposed to think that the greater part of the
non-terrestrial lines of the solar spectrum were due to the
vapours of compound bodies existing in the higher and
comparatively cool regions of the sun's atmosphere, and
having (as we know is the case with peroxide of nitrogen
and other coloured gases) the power of selective absorp-
tion changing rapidly and apparently capriciously with
the refrangibility of the light.
"If (as I take for granted) Sir William Thomson is right
as to the date [1852] when he began to introduce the sub-
ject into his lectures at Glasgow (Address at the Edin-

with him about Foucault's discovery, for I feel sure I did
not know it till 1855. Besides, when I heard it from
Foucault's mouth, it fell in completely with my previous
thoughts.

be once conceded as a result of theoretical considera-
tions?
Before briefly discussing these questions, let us refer for
a moment to one or two other minor points which deserve
a passing consideration as bearing upon the state of the
marine aquarium as a miniature sea, the health of whose
inhabitants is ensured in proportion as its actual condi-
tions approach to those of its natural prototype.
It has been suggested that the proportion of carbonic
acid held in solution in the water is a matter of more im-
portance than has been recognised, and that the effect of
the constant influx of a copious and finely comminuted
stream of air passing night and day through the tanks is,
after pretty completely oxidising the organic matter with
which their contents are charged, to displace the resulting
carbonic acid, and so reduce its percentage below the
normal amount present in the ocean; and a parallel has
been drawn between the condition of the inhabitants
under these circumstances and that of human beings
breathing an atmosphere containing an abnormal propor-
tion of oxygen.

In confirmation of this opinion, it has been pointed out
that one of the prominent results of the Challenger
researches is that animal life is abundant at the bottom of
the sea, while the amount of carbonic acid held in solu-
tion in its lowest strata exceeds that of the surface layer
by six or seven per cent.
Now, it is certain that, supposing all sources of further
or continuous supply of carbonic acid to be excluded, the
exposure to the air of any given bulk of water containing
the maximum quantity of that gas which it is capable of
holding in solution (or any less quantity) will finally result
in its total elimination; for Dalton long ago established
laws from which it follows that when water saturated with
a gas, e.g. carbonic acid, is placed in contact with the
open air, the whole of such gas is set free, while the water
absorbs the constituents of the air.
Hence the small quantity of carbonic acid always
present in sea-water is not due to absorption from the air,
but to the incessantly renewed supply afforded by the
oxidation of organic matter in the sea itself.
If this supply were not constantly maintained, this con-
stituent would vanish from the ocean. Its higher per-
centage in the lower strata of the sea is doubtless due to
three causes: 1, to the comparative stillness of the water,
whereby the diffusion of the solution is retarded; 2, to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the absence of direct contact with the air and exposure to
the wind; 3, and chiefly, to the increased pressure,
whereby solution of the gas is greatly facilitated; for
under pressure of 1 atmosphere and at ordinary tempera-
tures, 1 cubic centimetre of water dissolves in round
numbers 1 cubic centimetre, or rsso, milligrammes, of
carbonic acid, while under double that pressure the absorp-
tion is double, and so forth, varying oirectly as the pres-
sure, approximately.
It can hardly be doubted that this presence of a larger
proportion of carbonic acid in the lowest depths of the
ocean has a distinct correlation to the character of their
special inhabitants.
Prof. Wyville Thomson writes: "In the 'warm area,'
and wherever the bottom is covered with ooze, calcareous
forms predominate, and large sandy cristellarians, with
their sand-grains bound together by calcareous cement,
so that the sand-grains show out, dark and conspicuous,
scattered on the surface of the white shell." And again:
"The dredging at 2,435 fathoms at the mouth of the
Bay of Biscay gave a very fair idea of the condition of

of excess of food, or some other casualty coming into the
category of possible accidents, may be invaluable. The
influx of air can always be regulated, or even stopped,
while an insufficient supply might be fatal, at least to the
more delicate animals.
Let us now consider briefly the larger question, whether
vegetation ought to be admitted at all, and if so, under
what limitations and with what precautions.
It is a proposition requiring no proof that the more
nearly the actual conditions of nature can be approached
in our tanks, the more likely is success to ensue, and the
more varied will be both the classes and species of animils
which it will be possible to domesticate and maintain in
health.
An aquarium without seaweeds does indeed seem a
wide departure from this standard, and inasmuch as
vegetation fulfils the double function of naturally aerating
the water by absorbing carbonic acid and evolving oxygen,
and of affording wholesome and palatable food to fishes
and molluscs, its introduction would appear highly desir-
able if not attended with dangers more than sufficient to
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
counterbalance its advantages. On this point my friend
Mr. Hughes writes to me as follows in a recent letter :—
"I can no more see how fishes and molluscs can do with-
out vegetation than the higher primates without cabbages.
I feel certain that the mortality of fishes is due to its
absence in public aquaria. In my own tanks I have seen
a Blenny tugging at a mere rag of Ulva, black almost
with age, for half an hour, to get a mouthful of 'green
meat.'
"Our most beautiful family of British fishes, the Wrasses,
haunt the banks of Zostera and Fucus; and they do this
for more than mere play!"
The lovely tribe of Nudibranchs is practically excluded
at present by reason of the absence of their natural food,
the one or two species now admitted being animal feeders,
and by no means the most beautiful of their class.
Why, then, are not seaweeds seen in the aquaria at
Brighton, Sydenham, or Paris?
I believe the answer to be this. For some reason they
do not appear spontaneously in the tanks of public
aquaria; possibly because the water is deprived of all
germs of vegetation by the process of filtration or purifi-
cation to which it is subjected before use; more probably
because, in order to secure purity, it is generally taken
from deep water, where such germs are likely to be
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
absent.
Certain it is that in water taken from near shore and not
filtered, vegetation very speedily makes its appearance;
and it is impossible to suppose that the gentle flow of
water in the aquarium could present any obstacle to the
development of germs which are not prevented from find-
ing a resting-place and reproducing their species in every
rock-pool on shores washed by the tides and lashed by
the storms of the open Atlantic.
As vegetation does not spring up spontaneously in the
tanks, and as the possibility of doing without it has been
practically demonstrated, its introduction has been
avoided because the growth of Alga is so rapid that they
are apt to become uncontrollable, to overgrow and hide
the animals from view, and at certain seasons by their
rapid decay to introduce into the tanks a large amount of
decomposing matter of the most objectionable kind—dif-
ficult to remove by oxidation, and likely to be fatal to
many of their delicate inmates.
It cannot be doubted that the careless or indiscriminate
admission of vegetation into the marine aquarium is open

By using the perennial species exclusively or mainly, it
would be possible to depend solely or essentially upon
specimens thus attached, and having these always in
reserve, ruthlessly to exterminate any young individuals
which might spring up at inconvenient times and places
or in superabundant numbers, although it is more probable
that our marine friends would in most cases save all
trouble upon this point by anticipating the process.
Whoever among the managers of our public institutions
will have the enterprise to try this experiment will pro-

are being made on the Continent for promoting physico-

the new observatory which is being erected at Vienna,
and the illustrations which we are able to give will enable
our readers to form some idea of the plan of the
building.

south front of the observatory, the central entrance opening into the dwelling of the director, which is to the south of the
large dome.
"It is scarcely necessary for me to tell the Fellows of
the Royal Astronomical Society," Dr. De la Rue says,
"that their favourite branch of our science, namely, the
physics of astronomy, is now engaging the earnest atten-
tion of foreign professional astronomers to a greater
extent than obtained only a few years ago, and that grand
preparations are now being made at several Continental
State-observatories to grapple with the important truths
which can only be revealed by adequate instrumental
appliances such, indeed, as are far beyond the reach of
most private fortunes. It was a matter of satisfaction to

obiaincd to the terraces D, adapted for observations with portable instruments or the naked eye. The rooms E and F will receive the meridian
instruments, and in G is to be placed the prime vertical. The smaller domes, H, I, and K. are each 25 feet in diameter; besides the instruments
spoken of in the text, one of these domes will most probably be equipped with an altazimuth or a heliometer.

included in at least two of those observatories, namely,

Dr. De la Rue refers to the old Vienna Observatory,
which was founded in the year 1753, and rebuilt in
1826-27, but has been long so crowded round by other
buildings as seriously to interfere with the satisfactory
performance of astronomical work. After repeated repre-
sentations to the Austrian Government, the present Direc-
tor, M. C. von Littrow, obtained in 1873 the sanction of
the Minister of Public Instruction, K. von Stremayer,
for the erection of the building which is now approaching
completion. The new observatory is about three miles
to the north of the centre of the city, and was not com-
menced before Prof. Weiss, First Assistant at the Obser-

vatory, had visited the principal observatories in England
and America, and the workshops of the first instrument
makers in these and Continental countries. The site of
the observatory, of which the foundation-stone was laid
in June 1874, is a plateau of between 14 and 15 acres at
an elevation of about 200 feet above the mean level of
Vienna. The observatory is 330 feet long in the direc-
tion of north-south, and 240 feet in that of east-west.
It is hoped that the building will be completed in 1877,

central dome of 42 feet internal diameter, both of which,
as well as three smaller domes, two of which are shown
in Fig. 1, are being constructed by Mr. Howard Grubb of
Dublin. One of these smaller domes will contain an
equatorial refractor of 12 inches aperture, by Mr. Alvan
Clark, of Cambridgeport, Mass. "These two instru-
ments, together with a meridian circle having a telescope
of 8 inches aperture, and augmented by the instruments in
the old observatory, will constitute the first equipment of
the new establishment. Later on it is intended to place
in the third dome an equatorial reflector specially adapted
for photography, and also a prime vertical instrument in
the room near the fourth dome, to the north of the central
dome." .
One arrangement, which Dr. De la Rue, with some
justice, considers a drawback to an otherwise admirably
arranged establishment, is that the buildings comprise
the dwellings of the director, and apartments for tha
assistant astronomers. Although this arrangement will
no doubt add to the comfort of the astronomers, "it would
have been," Dr. De la Rue says, "in my opinion, pre-
ferable for the dwellings to have been detached, as the
heated air emanating from them will be liable to disturb
the definition of the instruments." We hope, however,
that practically no real inconvenience will arise from this

arrangement.
"From the preceding description it will be seen," Dr.
De la Rue concludes, " that Austria will not be left behind
in the steps which are being taken to promote physico-
astronomical observations; and I sincerely hope that our
own Government will ere long adopt measures to ensure
to England a fair chance of honourably com-
peting in the advancement of that branch of
astronomical science which the Fellows of this
Society have done so much to promote mainly
from their own individual resources."

Rodriguez, Mr. Balfour has shown, is, after all, a volcanic
island, possessing neither granite nor sandstone, but composed
wholly of igneous rocks, with patches of coralline limestone
along the coast. It belongs, therefore, geologically and geo-
graphically, to the Mascarene group. The general characters of
its fauna and flora approximate very closely to those of the
Mauritian group, upwards of 300 miles westward. Dr. Hooker
then referred to the remains of extinct birds, including
those of the Solitaire, and of extinct tortoises, which have
been found in Rodriguez. Mr. Slater is of opinion that both
classes of remains were entombed subsequently to the visits of
Europeans. With regard to Mr. Balfour's Report on the Flora of
Rodriguez, Dr. Hooker stated it as a very remarkable fact that
one of the two new genera of flowering plants which have been
found belonging to the natural order Turneraceae, is most
closely allied to a peculiar Panama genus; and that one of the
new species has only a single congener, which is a Pacific Island
plant.

for the National Collections, the remaining specimens will be
distributed. The total expenditure incurred was 1,512/, of
which 1,396/. has been contributed by Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, and the rest has been defrayed out of the Donation Fund.
With respect to the Total Eclipse Expedition of April, 1875,
Dr. Hooker speaks as follows :—
"Towards the close of last year (1874) the desirability of obser-
ving the total eclipse of the sun, which was to take place in India,
engaged the attention of your Council; and the subject was
under its consideration when a letter was received by me from
His Majesty the King of Siam, offering hospitality and assistance
should the Royal Society deem it expedient to appoint scientific
men to observe it from His Majesty's dominions.
"Your Council being of opinion that both the importance of
the occasion (totality during this eclipse being of longer duration
than during any other that would be observed in the present cen-
tury) and the liberal offer of His Majesty required careful con-
sideration, appointed a committee of five astronomers and the
Society's officers to report upon the feasibility of undertaking
such an expedition with a reasonable prospect of success. The
Committee was advised that no time was to be lost in arriving at
a conclusion, as only four months would elapse before the occur-
rence of the eclipse.
"The first step taken was to communicate with the First Lord
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of the Treasury and the Secretary of State for India, and ascertain
whether, should the attempt be made, Her Majesty's Govern-
ment would be disposed to co-operate with the Society.
"The answers were most favourable ; but still grave doubts
were entertained by several of the Committee as to whether it
were possible to make the necessary preparations and arrange-
ments with sufficient completeness to secure adequate results.
"After much deliberation it was decided in the affirmative, the
Committee's decision being based on the following favouring cir-
cumstances :—That confidence in its feasibility was expressed by
those members of the Committee who had themselves conducted
or accompanied eclipse expeditions in foreign countries ; that
two eminent observers, Messrs. Janssen and Tacchini, were
already in India and their services available; that Her Majesty's
Government would co-operate by proposing to Parliament a grant
in aid of 1,000/., which would be augmented by another of 300/.
from the Donation Fund of the Society; that the Secretary of
State for India and the Governor-General of India had promised
active co-operation by sending an expedition to the Nicobar
Islands, where, as well as in Siam, totality would be visible;

distribution of oceanic life that has no parallel on land; and
facts in the migration of marine animals and plants that were
formerly accounted for by assuming that they possessed greater
powers of withstanding changes of temperature, are now ac-
counted for by conditions more closely resembling those that
obtain on the land"
Dr. Hooker then referred to the lamented death of Dr. von
Willemoes-Suhm, and to the arrangement whereby Prof. Huxley
has been able to act as Prof. Thomson's sulratitute at Edin-
burgh.
Speaking of the Meteorological Committeee, Dr. Hooker
stated that "the anomalous connection between the Royal Society
and the Meteorological Office on the one hand, and between that
office and the Government on the other, is likely soon to be
terminated, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury having
appointed a Committee to inquire into the working of the
present office, and the value of the results hitherto obtained.
According to the instructions of the Treasury, the inquiry is to
be directed to two principal points of scientific interest, viz. (1)
How far the statistics hitherto collected have led to the discovery
or confirmation of meteorological laws. (2) How far the prin-

ciples upon which storm-warnings are given have been justified
by results."
While pointing out that America was in some respects more
advantageously situated than England for meteorological investi-
gation. Dr. Hooker showed that, on the other hand, England
has advantages for promoting the study of terrestrial meteorology
that no other country has—namely, her foreign possessions an!
colonies, and the command of the telegraphs with which the
ocean is in process of being crossed in every direction. "We
have known," he says, "what it is to read at our breakfast-
tables telegrams from all parts of the world of the prices of stocks
and of political incidents of the previous day ; why should we
not, then, obtain daily statistics of the climatic conditions of
these and other remote regions, and inaugurate in England a
system of meteorological registration which, if its elements were
obtained from but a lew well-selected spots, would instruct and
interest every intelligent person in the climate of the globe,
and in the end lead to scientific results of great value."
Dr. Hooker cannot but think that the Committee of the
Treasury will have the opportunity of recommending to Her
Majesty's Government the adoption of measures that would
greatly increase the scientific efficiency and public interest of the
Meteorological Office.
Dr. Hooker referred in terms of disappointment to the un-
expected interpretation which has been put by the Law Lords
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
on the terms of the Gilchrist bequest, whereby no part of it
can be allotted to " the advancement of learning " i.e. of research,
but all to the propagation of knowledge. Dr. Hooker hopes
that a future and more enlightened generation " will introduce
into the theory and practice of the law an interpretation of the
'advancement of learning' more in harmony with scientific
ideas and the requirements of the age."
The president concluded his address by alluding to the
Government Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments, which is
being formed at South Kensington.
"In the proposed exhibition not only are modern scientific
methods and instruments, and the various methods of practical
instruction in science to be fully dealt with, but it is also pro-
posed that the history of science shall be illustrated by the actual
instruments which have been employed from the time of Galileo
downwards, in those critical experiments and discoveries which
mark the principal stages along the road of progress."

We would draw the special attention of our readers to a paper
in the current number of the Journal of Mental Science, by Dr.

Prof. C. Holten has sent us "Tables Meteorologiques de
Copenhague pour l'annee 1874," prepared by him, and pub-
lished under the auspices of the Royal Danish Academy of
Sciences and Letters. A special feature of this publication is
-the long averages which appear with the monthly sheets of obser-
vations. As regards rain, the averages are for fifty-five years,
and as regards temperature for ninety-two years. The tempera-
ture averages are particularly valuable, seeing that they are given
for this long series of years for each day, each five-days period,
and each month of the year.

Cambridge valley. A short description of the geology and
physical features of the district was given, and an inference drawn
from the varying faunas of the "Crag" that the land was sink-
ing during that era and until after the deposition of the Cromer
"Forest-bed." Then Arctic conditions began to prevail, and
the great glacial subsidence commenced; the "lower glacial"
beds were formed, and succeeded by a large series of false-bedded
gravels and sands, with intercalated patches of unstratified clay.
These deposits run up only to a certain level, about 300 feet,
never quite reaching the top of the chalk escarpment, where
the overlying boulder-clay is invariably found resting on the
older rock, without any gravel or sand between. The author
inferred from this circumstance that after the deposition of the
"lower" beds, and as submergence went on, the waters of the
North Sea were again united to those of the Atlantic A strong
current was thus set up, which swept down from the north,
bringing with it the material of which the gravels are composed,
and which is found to consist of pebbles, all derived from the
northern and eastern coasts, mixed with flints from the chalk.
The escarpment of this formation stood at the time above the
water, but when once sufficiently submerged to admit the water

over its lower portions, the conditions were altered, the current
lost its force, and the deposition of gravel ceased. An oc-
casional iceberg had dropped its load of un (ratified clay, which
became intercalated with the gravels, but the greater number of
such bergs were quickly swept away to the south. Now the
waters had access to a larger area, the formation of gravel was
succeeded by that of boulder-clay, which in the author's opinion
is entirely composed of masses of clay enclosing boulders, brought
down and dropped by icebergs in mass, which accounts for its
want of stratification. This boulder-clay rests evenly on and
at the higher level overlaps the "middle glacial" sands ; it then
caps the chalk escarpment and plunges down into the Cambridge
valley, even to the present level of the sea; but in no instance
on or beyond the escarpment does any sand or gravel intervene
between it and the older geological formations, although just
over the scarp (on the south side) the gravels run up to an
elevation of 300 feet. The gravel-forming currents were
evidently confined to the seaward side of the chalk range, and
excluded from the Cambridge valley, which is undoubtedly pre-
glacial, and which formed at the time a large inlet, land locked
on every side but one, discharging its waters through the open-
ing now occupied by the estuary of "The Wash." In the
Cambridge valley there are sheets of river-gravel of recent date,
some patches of doubtful age, but not traceable under the
boulder-clay, and an elongated series of gravels at a level of 20

to 60 feet above the present level of the Cam. These are in some
parts distant from the present course of the river, and present a
striking resemblance to glacial gravels; but as they here and
there contain recent shells, and taking into consideration their
uniformity of level, the author concludes that they indicate an
ancient course of the River Cam. The other conclusions
arrived at, after mature consideration of all the evidence hitherto
obtained, are — that a gradual passage will be found to exist
from the base of the crag up to and through the drift-deposits
to those of recent date ; that in East Anglia we have evidence
of but one, and that a gradual period of glacial submergence
succeeded by a corresponding movement of re-elevation; and
that there are no "middle glacial " deposits whatever within the
area of the Cambridge valley.—"Denuding Agencies and Geo-

power. 2. That the staff as a sceptre was probably a later form of
the horn which was thus used in very early prehistoric times, and in
that character adorned the heads of gods. 3. That from the use of

rods or horns arose a veneration for them as possessing the inhe-
rent power of healing disease and even of restoring life. Hence
their use by magicians in all ages and countries, the chief instru-
ments employed by them being a ring or circle, and a staff and a
bifurcated stick. 4. That these symbols conjoined are found in
Egyptian, Assyrian, and Peruvian sculptures, and may be traced
in some of the stone circles of Britain, and in the shape of Irish
and African brooches and fibula;. 5. That from the belief in
the magical powers of rods perhaps arose tree-worship, or at
least such veneration for trees as is observable of the oaks of
Dordona and of the Druids, the ash of Scandinavia, and, for
some unexplained reason, more particularly of the hazel. 6.
That belomancy, or divination by marked arrows, said to
be of Scythic origin, was practised in Babylon, Judaea, and
Arabia, and that traces of it may still be found in the
folk tales of Russia and Siberia. 7. That the mode
of using these arrows had a strong resemblance to the
very ancient custom of casting lots common to all peoples
ancient and modern. 8. That tlie invention of lots and dice, as
well as that of the divining rod, is ascribed to Hermes or Mercury
identified with the Woden of Scandinavia, and by some writers
also with the India Buddha. 9. That a strong resemblance
exists between the implements of magic and the ancient alphabets,
also the reputed invention of the same god or gods. 10. That
many of the Mgns or letters forming the Archaic-Phoenician, and
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
other alphabets, are found in the rock sculptures of Peru, thus
adding one more to the many proofs of a communication existing
between the hemispheres in prehistoric times. II. That the arts
of magic and divination were not of Aryan origin, but remnants
of the Turanian or Pre-Arjan faith which once overspread the
world. 12. That this is proved by their present existence among
aboriginal non-Aryan races, and may, perhaps, even be used as
a test of race, so that tho^e who in Somerset and Cornwall are
said to possess the power of divination by the rod may possibly
hare some remote affinity with the aboriginal inhabitants of
Britain.

OUR WATER SUPPLY
THE last Report of the Commissioners appointed to
inquire into the Pollution cf Rivers has excited a
considerable amount of public attention, and the press,
in addition to giving its own views on the matters
reported on, has printed a considerable number of letters
from private persons interested in the question. We have,
of course, had the usual remarks about the conflicting
statements of scientific witnesses, and a large quantity of
ingenuity has been expended in attempts to prove that
this conflicting evidence is an indication of the witnesses
being so wedded to pet theories that they are unable or
unwilling to see facts in their true light, and hence that
the best way is to let matters take their course and trust
that everything will come right in the end. To a very
large portion of the world this conclusion is a most com-
fortable one to arrive at, as it spares the -atepayer and
offers no offence to the dreaded "vested interest." On
the other hand, there is a considerable section of the
public which cannot hear that any part of our institutions
is not absolutely perfect without being thrown into a

state of nervousness and dread, a section well exemplified
on the occasion of a former report by a paper which stated
that—" We must face the dreadful fact that no amount of
filtration can free our water from the nitrates and nitrites
which are amongst the most deadly of poisons!"
No person of ordinary common sense can fail to per-
ceive the folly of the alarmist school, but to the non-
scientific public the fallacies of those whose cry is stare
super vias antiquas are much more difficult to detect.
Unfortunately the education through which most of the
present generation have gone is not one which can enable
them to arrive at any correct judgment as to the value of
statements made by one scientific witness as compared
with those made by another; the natural result of their
education is in fact to cause them to attach a great value
to the statements of a man who has a reputation for what
is known as "popular science," and to regard the real
worker or knower as an amiable enthusiast or eccentric
theorist who is so carried away by his fancies that he is
quite incompetent to pronounce upon practical matters.
The same habit of mind induces them to value the state-
ments of those whom they are pleased to call "practical
men," who are generally men having an empiric or im-
perfect knowledge of certain processes. The result of
this is that the opinion of one who has a mere smattering of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
chemistry, and therefore considers himself qualified to
speak on all chemical questions, is pitted against that
of one who has devoted his life to chemical and phy-
sical science, and the puzzled outsider sits down ex-
claiming, "Who is to decide when doctors disagree?"
Again, this state of things is pretty well known to the
people who are put on their trial by the allegations of those
appointed to inquire into sanitary affairs, and they know
well enough where to lay their hands on those who will
make the best of a case entrusted to them; and we cannot
help thinking that if it were possible to tabulate the
names of the scientific witnesses called during the last
ten years on the side of sanitary reform or on the side

LIEUT. CAMERON IN CENTRAL AFRICA
THE first detailed news of the latter half of Lieut.
Cameron's trans-African expedition was read at the
Geographical Society on Monday night, in the form of ex-
tracts from letters of the explorer, who intends to remain at
Loando until he has a chance of finding a genial climate
here. Wc do not yet possess details sufficient to authorise
us in drawing final conclus ions as to the results so far as
the great problem of Central African drainage is con-
cerned; though we are quite justified in concluding that
Lieut. Cameron has proved himself to be possessed of the
qualifications of an explorer of the first rank, and that
means ought to be found of making still further use of his
valuable services. He has not been able to accomplish
all he intended when he set out from Ujiji in March 1874,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:51 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
but he has certainly added very largely to our accurate
knowledge of Central Africa. He was not able, owing to
the hostility of the natives, and the want of pluck in his
followers, to follow the course of the Lualaba in order to
ascertain whether or not it joins the Congo. He has,
however, obtained data which render it very improbable
that the Lualaba and Tanganyika contribute to the Nile
system ; the only known outlet of the lake, the Lukuga, he
has ascertained, flows into the Lualaba. This latter river
at Nyangwe is only 1,400 feet above the sea, or 500 feet
below the N ile at Gondokoro, and lies in the centre of an
enormously wide valley, " which receives the drainage of
all this part of Africa, and is the continuation of the
valleys of the Luapula and Lualaba." Cameron found
that the river, contrary to Livingstone's- report, really
turns to the west below Nyangwe, and the Arabs report
that further down it flows W.S.W. A river, the Lowa,
said to be as large as the Lualaba, at Nyangwe, joins it
from the northward a short way farther down, besides
other important rivers from the same direction. Cameron
failed to make his way to Sankorra, a lake into which the
Lualaba falls, and to which "trowser-wearing traders are
reported to come in large sailing-boats to buy palm-oil
and dust (probably gold) packed in quills."
Lieut. Cameron traces with considerable minuteness the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
course of the Lualaba to some distance below Nyangwe.
He shows that the true Lualaba in its upper course is the
liver to the west of Lake Bangweolo, crossed by the
I'ombeiros in their trading journeys to Cassembe's Town,
and that Livingstone's Upper Lualaba is properly called
the Luvwa. The river receives many tributaries during
its course to Nyangwe, and passes through a number of
lakes, so that by the time it reaches its final destination it
must be a river surpassed in volume by few others.
All this seems to indicate that the Lualaba reaches the
sea on the west coast, but that it does so by means of the
Congo it would at present be unsafe absolutely to assert,
though if it do not, what other Central West African
river is of sufficient size to carry off the immense drain-
age which the Lualaba evidently represents?
On account of the vexatious obstacles to his course
along the Lualaba, Cameron turned southward, and
during his journey south and then west to Benguela he
made many valuable and accurate observations which
will help greatly in filling up that portion of the map of
Africa. Some distance south of Nyangwe he came upon

"perpendicular to the middle," and so on.* It is hardly
good English to say one point becomes confounded with

confound the different steps of the reasoning, and the boy

fully on this Book V., which is especially faulty. We
shall close our remarks on the text by quoting a sentence
on p. 171, simply remarking that we could have extended
our criticism to twice or thrice the dimensions of the
present notice. The sentence is: "The further develop-
ment of the Theory of Transversals is reserved for a
special treatise on Modern Geometry, with a popular view
of the recent improvements introduced by M. Chasles."

we. Who and what is Mr. J. R. Morell, that
he should venture to act as interpreter of M.
Chasles' brilliant contributions to Geometry? Such
a work brought out by a competent writer would be
of great use. It was in 1871, that Mr. Morell pub-
lished "The Essentials of Geometry, Plane and Solid,
as taught in French and German Schools, with Shorter
Demonstrations than in Euclid," &c. After the reception
this little work met with one would have hoped that the
author would have learnt wisdom, and before he sent forth
another such work into the world would have submitted it

we can extend to the external aspect of "Euclid Simpli-

arrive at that period of the history when the improvement
in lenses effected by Chevallier enabled the time of expo-

but even then the sitter had to remain motionless for four
or five minutes in full sunshine! The torments of the

The next stage of photographic history brings us to
the time of Niepce de Saint-Victor (nephew of the Niepce
who was in partnership with Daguerre), who first dis-
covered the albumen on glass process. The application
of collodion to photography by Legray in France, and
Scott Archer in England, brings the art down to its pre-
sent state of development, and the author at this stage
brings the historical portion of the subject to a conclusion.
In the second part of the work the operations and pro-
cesses of photography are dealt with in seven chapters.
The watchful vigilance which the editor has kept over the
interests of British science has here for once failed. The
whole credit of the bichromate of potash and gelatine pro-
cess—the foundation of all the photographic permanent
printing processes—is more than once in the course of
the work assigned to Poitevin. "The various processes
or producing positive carbon prints," writes M. Tissandier

on p. 162, "are based on the principle indicated by
Alphonse Poitevin in 1855." We must remind our readers
that a patent for the use of bichromate and gelatine in
steel engraving was taken out in this country by Fox
Talbot in 1852.
Of the carbon processes that of Swan is described by
the author, and the editor adds a brief account of the
most recent improvements in this branch of the art
adopted by the Autotype company. The last chapter of
this part relates to the problems yet awaiting solution,
and is chiefly devoted to an account of the attempts which
have been made to photograph in natural colours.
The third and last part of M. Tissandier's book treats
of the applications of photography. In the first chapter
we have a description of the various heliographic and

photo-lithographic processes which have from time to
time been invented, including those of Donne", Fizeau,
Niepce de Saint-Victor, Poitevin, Baldus, Gamier and
Salmon, Albert, and Obemetter. The second chapter,
under the title of "Photoglypty," is devoted to a de-
scription of the Woodbury process, after which follow
two chapters on photo-sculpture and photo-graphic
enamels. Chapter V. treats of photo-micrography, and
is illustrated by several excellent engravings of photo-
graphs of microscopic objects. The following chapter
describes the application of photography to war. The
method of sending microscopic despatches by carrier-
pigeons adopted during the siege of Paris will be of
interest to our readers. The despatch having been
printed was reduced by photography on to a collodion
film, which was then rolled up and enclosed in a quill, which
was fastened to the tail of the pigeon. We here repro-
duce a facsimile of one of these microscopic despatches.
To read the despatches sent in this way the collodion
film was unrolled by immersion in weak ammonia water,

electric microscope (see Fig. 2).
Chapter VII. treats of astronomical photography, and
touches upon the results achieved in this branch of the
art by Warren De la Rue, Secchi, Rutherfurd, Grubb, &c.
The author is not quite accurate when he states that
for astronomical photography "it is indispensable to
make use of a reflecting telescope having a speculum
formed of glass silvered according to Foucault's process."
The experiments of Rutherfurd show that lenses may be
used with excellent results. Chapter VIII. describes pho-
tographic registering apparatus, barometric, thermome-
tric, magnetic, electric, &c. ; and Chapter IX. is devoted
to stereoscopic photography.
Chapter X. treats of the applications of photography
to art, while the last chapter discusses the future of pho-
tography. The author expresses a hope that among
other developments which the art is destined to undergo,
the time may come when it will be possible to photograph
by telegraphic means.
The foregoing sketch of the book will be sufficient to
enable our readers to form an estimate of its contents.

The Late Eclipse
An answer to Mr. Proctor (vol. xiii. p. 186) is unnecessary to
those who know all that has been written on the possibility of
photographing the spectrum of the corona, but I take the liberty
to give a few quotations out of the literature on the subject for
the benefit of those who take an interest in the discussion, yet
had no opportunity of following it in detail. Want of space
prevents me from quoting all the letters in full, but I believe that
I have not left out anything which might alter the sense of the
quotations. The passages which seem to me to be important
to the point at issue are printed in italics.
1. Letter to the Editor of the Daily News, signed Richard A.
Proctor, January 26, 1875 :—
"It is said that some enthusiastic students of science propose
to try to get photographs, not of the corona as seen in a tele-
scope, but of the exceedingly faint coronal image seen with a

spectroscope. If they succeed they will have achieved a clever
photographic feat, but the result, so far as the corona is con-
cerned, can have little scientific value. // is mathematically
demonstrable that this is the case, for the quantity of light actually
forming the coronal image can be shown to be far less in amount
than is necessary for the formation of a satisfactory photograph."
2. Letter signed "A Fellow of the Royal Astronomical
Society" {English Mechanic, May 21, p. 248):—
. . . . "But if Mr. Proctor should take upon him to answer
the first of these questions in the affirmative, the second in the
negative, then I could ask him whether any body or any set of
men possessing the slightest knowledge of the subject could or would
have issued the preposterous instructions about photographing the
spectra of bright lines in the corona, which emanated from the
Jioyal Society? The bright lines in the corona! Why, it has
been recorded again and again by skilful observers that so faint
is the light of the whole corona during thj totality of a solar
eclipse, that it casts no shadow whatever; and we know that the
outer parts of the corona failed utterly to impress a collodion
plate in five seconds, upon which a sharp and effective image of
the partially eclipsed moon impressed itself in O'l second with a
longer focussed telescope!"

anonymous writer had not Mr. Proctor's reference to them in the
following letter rendered it necessary.)

3. Letter from Mr. Richard A. Proctor (English Mechanic,
May 28, 1875, p. 272) :—
"With respect to the eclipse observations last April, I have
already said, as 'F.R.A.S.' does (let. 9,113, p. 248), that the
failure of the Government expedition was rendered certain by
the instructions of the Royal Socie'y Committee. I pointed this
out also before the expedition started. /agree with 'F.R.A.S.'
entirely in his interpretation of the matter."
Taking these letters in connection with what Mr. Proctor now
writes, the following seems to be Mr. Proctor's opinion :—
It is mathematically demonstrable that "the quantity of
light forming the coronal image is far less in amount than is
necessary for the formation of a satisfactory photograph" (Daily
News), yet "Dr. Schuster proves very readily that the spectrum
of the corona can be photographed in one minute" (Nature).
Mr. Proctor "is not aware that anyone has questioned the fact,"
but he "fully agrees with an anonymous writer that no set of
men having the slightest knowledge of the subject could have
issued the instructions which emanated from the Royal Society."
The failure of the Eclipse Expedition was rendered certain by
the instructions of the Royal Society Committee to photograph

Blowpipe Analysis
Major Ross (Nature, vol. xiii. p. 186) does not appear to
have thought of the impurities his soda might contain in his test
for the presence of a sulphide. Had he done so he would pro-
bably have remembered that all soda (unless specially prepared
from sodium) contains traces of iron. This iron, on fusing with
the sulphide, forms ferrous sulphide, which, as is well known, is
soluble in fused sodium sulphide; and on adding water to the
fused mass a black residue of ferrous sulphide remains behind.
Again, he says "there can be no room to precipitate anything
in a drop of water;" but surely this is erroneous. It is only a
question of degree. Under the same circumstances a precipitate
would be as certainly formed in a drop of water as in a gallon.
If Major Ross were to make allowances for the ordinary im-
purities of commercial reagents, a little more confidence might
be placed in his tests. ''"

While reading Mr. Wills's very suggestive article on Marine
Aquaria in your last issue, the following question suggested itself
to me :—Does not the " larger proportion of carbonic acid in the
lowest depths of the ocean" explain, at any rate partially, the
formation of the' "abyssal red clay," which Prof. Wyville
Thomson has proved to occupy so large a portion of the bed of
the Atlantic?
"Many of the insoluble carbonates, and in particular those of
lime, magnesia, &c, may be dissolved to some extent by water,
charged with carbonic acid, and are deposited in a crystalline
form, as the g^s slowly escapes from the fluid." (Miller's
"Chemistry.")
That the presence of carbonic acid in the deep water is one
cause of the decomposition of the shells of Mollusca, &c, I
think that there can hardly be a doubt. Whether it is sufiicient
by itself to account for the whole phenomenon, I cannot presume
to decide. HJ. M'G.

AN EXPLORING EXPEDITION TO THE

ONLY a short time ago the Geographical Society of
Amsterdam took the first preliminary steps towards
the realisation of a long-cherished idea,—the exploration
of those parts of Sumatra which have hitherto been indi-
cated by white patches on our maps of that island, even
though they form part of the colonial territory. These

regions are bounded to the south by the residencies of
Palembang and Bencoolen, to the east by the Straits of
Banka and the Sea of Riouw, and to the west by the
highlands of Padang and the chain of volcanic moun-
tains which traverses the island in its whole length, running
parallel to the coast. All the above-named districts are
tolerably well known, the native kingdoms of Reteh,
Indragiri, and Kwantan, situated farther north, perhaps
excepted. It is this white patch, better known under the
name of the Djambi territory, which the expedition will
choose for the special object of its researches.
For more than one reason this and no other part of
the interesting island has been chosen. In the north
the war with Atchin is for the present an impediment
to a peaceful party of explorers, although a better ac-
quaintance with those tribes of the Malayan race known
as the Battaks would be highly interesting from a lin-
guistic and ethnological point of view. This having to
be given up, the question of the navigability of the
Djambi River, which might, moreover, prove of so much
importance on commercial grounds, induced the Geo-
graphical Society definitely to fix its choice on the indi-
cated parts, rather than on Indragiri, Reteh, or any of the
above-named districts.
The only European who has ever visited the domains

of the Sultan of Djambi, and has left any official documents
about the state of things as he found them, was the
Palembang resident van Ophuyzen, who, in 1869, travelled
a good way up the Djambi River, with the Government
steamer Bom. Unfortunately, he was obliged to return
sooner than he wished, for reasons dictated neither by
the hostility of the population, nor by the barrenness of the
country; on the contrary, he has reported very favour-
ably on both these points. He had, moreover, occasion
to notice the existence of several important tributary
rivers, and as far as his survey extended he found the
Djambi itself everywhere navigable. His reports to the
Government at Batavia have formed a valuable basis
upon which the Geographical Society has drawn up its
projects for the present expedition.
The body of explorers will begin by separating into two
parties, one of which will ascend the river in a steamer
which it is expected Government will place at their dis-
posal, the other party starting from Padang and passing the
mountain chain above-mentioned somewhere between the
volcanoes of Talang and Indrapoora, will try to follow

look upon this as a warlike demonstration, and their love
of independence would then prevent the exploring party
from accomplishing its task.
Not only from a geographical and ethnological point of
view is this expedition expected to be a brilliant success,
but also in the several departments of natural history
the results are likely to be of high scientific value. A
naturalist is to be appointed, who will accompany the
explorers and enrich the zoological and geological depart-
ments of the national museum of Holland with interesting
specimens from regions hitherto so superficially known.
There is some probability of a botanist being appointed
by a committee of botanists and horticulturists, who will
pay his expenses, and thus make the expedition profitable
for this department of natural science as well.
The staff of the expedition will further consist of an
able geographer, to whom the topographical department
is to be confided, and of a linguist, who will study the
languages of the tribes met with. It is a curious fact that
in Sumatra the languages spoken by contiguous popula-
tions show very considerable differences. He will at the

same time be able to serve as an interpreter, where this
may prove necessary, and will no doubt have occasion to
gather some interesting ethnological data. An artist will
complete the party of explorers, which is to leave Holland
in the beginning of next summer.
It is expected that one or more able naval officers will
be appointed by the Indian Government to the command
of the vessel in which a great part of the surveying work
is to be done. They will of course bring a most welcome
support to the geographer, to whom assistance of this kind
may prove almost indispensable.
As to the financial side of the question, the expenses re-
quired to carry out the scheme when reduced to its most
simple dimensions, have been evaluated at 2,000 guineas.
The Geographical Society, having been founded only a
couple of years ago, has no funds at all at its disposal, and
so an appeal has been made to the public, scientific and
commercial, with a view of obtaining the required money
by private efforts only. Government will not be applied
to before the subscriptions have surpassed the above
sum, and when the possibility of realisation will thus
have been assured. A Governmental subsidy will then
not be a conditio sine qud non for the expedition, but only
a means of giving it a wider extension, of bringing within
its range a larger field than the original 2,000 guineas

would admit of. As the national interest in the expedition
is increasing every day, it is expected that this sum will
be raised within a very short time.
The Colonial Office at the Hague strongly supports the
efforts of the Society, and the Government at Batavia
has promised its earnest co-operation. Another favour-
able circumstance is to be found in the willingness of the
Sultan of Djambi, now on the best terms with the Dutch
colonial authorities, first, to permit of this scientific invasion
into his domains, and secondly, to lend his assistance
wherever this might be of any use. As a palpable proof
he has already put his son-in-law at the disposal of the
exploring party, for the purpose of accompanying them
on their tours. Policy seems to play a part in the un-
expected magnanimity of this potentate.
Let us hope the best for the realisation of all those
promising plans, and may I, ere long, have the opportu-
nity of bringing under your notice some results of an ex-
pedition by which science in general cannot but profit.

the short-styled form occupying the lower part (iA mm.

Honey is secreted by the ovary in such quantity that it fills
up the lowermost part of the corolla-tube so far as nearly

then, the entrance between the margins of the upper lip
being completely closed, they forcibly break it open with
their fore-legs, grasping with them between the margins,
and shaking the anthers in order to gain their pollen;
thus a good deal of the smooth, powdery pollen grains,
falling out of the shaken anthers, is received within the
brushes and feathery hairs of their fore-legs, and thence
carried to the pollen-collecting orifice of the posterior
tibia. This incommodious and wearisome labour, al-
though performed by the humble-bees with admirable
dexterity and perseverance, contrasts remarkably with
the swift and light manner of their gathering pollen, and
at the same time sucking honey in flowers adapted to
them ;* and many peculiarities of the flowers of Rh. alfii-
1111s would be quite unintelligible under the supposition
that pollen-collecting humble-bees were the true and ori-
ginal fertilisers of them. The honey, so copiously secreted
in the base of these flowers, would be quite useless to
the plant if pollen-collecting humble-bees were its true
fertilisers; the minute opening between the two lateral
flaps at the tip of the beaked prolongation of the upper

lip would likewise be useless, and the closeness of the
usual entrance between the margins of the upper lip
would be a mere embarrassment to the fertilisers. Sup-
posed; on the contrary, that Lepidoptera are the original
fertilisers of Rh. alpinus, all these peculiarities are easily
to be understood as very useful, nay, as indispensable to
the plant; for honey is the only food eagerly searched for
by butterflies, and the closeness of the usual entrance, as
well as the existence of the minute opening in its very
place, are required in order to induce visiting butterflies
to insert their proboscis in the only manner which can
effect cross-fertilisation. Hence, in spite of the frequent
visits of pollen-collecting humble-bees, and in spite of
their probably effecting many cross-fertilisations, the
flowers of Rh. alpinus are without any doubt to be con-
sidered as adapted exclusively to butterflies.
But considering the original function of the under lip
as a landing-place for bees, and considering that the
most nearly-allied genera, Euphrasia, Melampyrum,
1'cdicularis, as well as Rhinanthus crista-galli, are all
adapted to bees, we can hardly doubt that also the
ancestors of Rh. alpinus have been adapted to cross-ferti-
lisation by bees, and the question maybe started, by what
connecting forms these ancestors could be transformed
into the present form of Rh. alpinus. We may confi-

dently suppose that they retained the usual entrance for
humble-bees, until the beaked prolongation of the upper
lip, the minute opening at its tip, and the lateral flaps of
this opening were so developed as to secure cross-fertilisa-
tion by butterflies.
In this respect Rhinanthus alcctorolophus is of especial
interest; for it represents really what by reflection we are
induced to suppose once existed in the connecting forms
between Rh. alpinus and its ancestors (compare Figs.
76-81). Rh. alcctorolophus has indeed retained the usual
entrance by which humble-bees may insert their pro-
boscis in order to suck the honey (c, Figs. 79, 80), and
may be regularly cross-fertilised by sucking humble-bees,
whilst at the same time the minute opening (o, Figs. 76-
81) and all those peculiarities which secure cross-fertilisa-
tion by sucking butterflies, are developed.
From the structure of its flowers, as shown by Figs.
78-81, we should expect that this species would be cross-
fertilised as well by sucking humble-bees as by butterflies.
My direct observation of the fertilisers, however, in the
same localities with Rh. alpinus, shows no remarkable

investigation. Hence a correct discrimination between
them is very desirable.
The first and simplest kind of beat we will distinguish
ty the name of the Union Beat, it being produced by the
concurrence of two sounds nearly, but not quite, in unison
with each other. Let two organ-pipes, or any other sus-
tained sound";, be tuned first exactly in unison ; the com-
bined effect will be equable and smooth, undistinguishable
from a single sound. But now let one of the notes be
put out of tune, at first very slightly ; the result will be a
peculiar effect of wavy pulsation or beating. The exact
description varies according to the fancy of different
hearers, but it is usually said to resemble an alternation
of different vowel sounds, like waw, waw, wain, or ya,ya,
ya. The beating, when the notes are but slightly out of
tune, will be slow; if the error is made worse, the pulsa-
tions will increase in rapidity, till they become too quick
to be counted.
This fact is very commonly known, and its experi-

mental exhibition is exceedingly simple and easy. If
organ-pipes and the means of tuning them cannot be had,
the two sounds may be produced on any wind instrument,
which can be easily put into the adjustment necessary. Or
one of two unison reeds of a harmonium may be thrown
out of tune by weighting it with a little bit of wax ; indeed,
in the drawing-room instruments one unison stop is
usually made purposely out of tune with another, the com-
position giving a tremulous effect resembling the shaking
of the voice, the stop being named "voix celeste" (in
Italian organs a stop called the " vox humana" is formed
of two pipes tuned in a similar way). These are real
unison beats with so short a period as to produce
the tremulous effect in question. Two unison tuning-
forks may also be thrown out of tune by attaching wax
to the arm of one of them, which will make it a little
flatter.
The beats may also be well produced on a violin.
Stop A with the fourth finger on the third string, and
play it along with the second string open, when the
adjustment of the former may be made with the greatest
nicety, and if it be put out of tune the resulting beat will
sometimes be so prominent as almost to shake the instru-
ment under the chin. On a pianoforte the beats may also
be observed when one wire of a note is a little sharp or

flat of another, although this case is not so favourable
for observation, from the sounds not being sustained.
Now, in seeking for the explanation of this pheno-
menon, a homely preliminary illustration will be useful.
Suppose two coffin-makers live next door to each other,
and suppose that on some particular day they both strike
the blows on their nails at exactly the same rate, and
begin exactly together; the effect on a passer-by will be
that the sounds of the two will reach his car simul-
taneously, smoothly, and regularly, and he will have diffi-
culty in distinguishing the combined sound from what
would be produced by one workman only. But now
suppose that by some change in the fancy of one of the
men, A, he begins to strike a little faster than his neigh-
bour, making, we will say, eleven strokes to ten of the
other, B. The effect on the passer-by will be changed,
the sounds will reach his ear irregularly, and, which is
the important thing, there will be regular periodical
phases appreciable; for it is obvious that at every
tenth blow of B, or every eleventh of A, the blows will
coincide, after which they will diverge and become irre-

NATURE
Similarly, with the sounds. Although the 103 vibra-
tion-sound and the 100 vibration-sound only coincide
with theoretical accuracy once in a second, yet there is,
three times per second, a coincidence so nearly accurate
(within Tusmr of a second) that the practical effect in
producing the beat is the same.
The rule, therefore, is practically right; but it should
be qualified scientifically with the following addition :—
When the two vibration-numbers are prime to each other
(i.e. when they are not both divisible by any whole num-
ber) the rule is not theoretically accurate, but if the times
0/ vibration are very small (as they always are in prac-
tice) the error has no practical effect, and the rule conse-
quently holds good.
With the aid of this rule we can now tell the exact
number of unison beats that will correspond to any
amount by which the two notes are out of tune; and,
vice versd, we can tell the exact quantity by which two
notes intended for unisons are out of tune by simply
counting the number of beats they give. For example, sup-
pose the A open string on the violin is played along with the

fourth finger note (first position) on the third string, and
that the latter is a little sharp, so as to give four beats per
second, we know that the upper note will have four vibra-
tions per second more than the other; and as at this
point of the scale about twenty vibrations go to a semi-
tone, we can tell that the upper note is about one-fifth of
a semitone sharper than the lower one. To effect this,
the fourth finger must be moved about one-twelfth of an
inch nearer the nut than the former position, and this can
be measured if any player think it worth the trouble, as
a check to the calculation.
We may next inquire what effect on the ear is produced
by changes in the rapidity of the beats. At first, when
they are slow, no very unpleasant sensation is perceived,
but as they become faster they give a sensation of rough-
ness which is disagreeable in a marked degree. With a
further increase of rapidity the effect becomes again less
unpleasant, until it arrives at the slight tremulousness
already mentioned in the voix celeste and vox humana
stops, and which, as it is purposely produced, may be sup-
posed to be rather agreeable than otherwise.
If we carry the error farther, the beats become so fast
that the ear ceases to be able to appreciate them, and the
beating effect entirely disappears.
Heliriholtz, who has paid much attention to this sub-

ject, and who has founded on this property of beats some
important musical speculations, is of opinion that the dis-
agreeable effect increases gradually until the beats arrive at
about thirty per second, where the harshness is at a
maximum ; that then the unpleasantness lessens as they
grow faster, until, at about 100, or something more, per
second, the beating effect disappears. Hence he calls
from O to this point beating distance for any two notes
near each other.
For example, if starting from the treble C, 512 vibra-
tions per second, we sharpen the note to Di», 546 vibra-
tions, and then sound this with the original C, we shall
get 546 — 512 = 34 beats per second, which gives a very
harsh effect. If we go on to D, 576 vibrations, we shall
get, for the interval C to D, 576 - 512 = 64 beats per
second, which is less harsh ; and if we go on to C with
E?, we shall have 614 - 512 = 102 beats, which is hardly
perceptible. For C to E, a major third, we have 640 -
512 = 12S beats, and no one can assert that this inter-
val, when in tune, has anything harsh or disagreeable
about it.

of the strata should be determined. The plateau region drained
by the Colorado River of the West was more particularly under
review in the essay before the Academy. Springing from the
plateaus are single mountains, short ranges, and volcanic cones
disposed in groups ; the affluents of the river have their source in
high mountains on the edge of the drainage basin. The river
and its chief tributaries differ from other great rivers in the ab-
sence of considerable valleys along their course, at least north
of 35' latitude. The streams run in deep canons, and these, with
other topographic features, separate the plateaus. This is part
of the whole region of the United States west of the 100th meri-
dian, which is distinguished by being everywhere of great altitude,
with the trifling exceptions of a strip on the Pacific coast and
some valleys of the larger streams. The rivers descend so
rapidly that they are of little service for navigation ; the valleys
are exceedingly narrow ; the table-lands and mountains are tree-
less, arid, and almost desolate, Bare rocks rarely masked by any
soil give character to the "Rocky Mountain" region. Here
there is everywhere an open book to the geologist, as the forma-
tions can be clearly traced, and the sections given by canons
display in regular succession the strata of palaeozoic, mesozotc,
and cainozoic eras, a total depth of 60,000 feet being thus re-
vealed. The characteristics of the formations of this region were
discussed at considerable length. As an instance of the irregu-
larities of slrat), the observations on lignite may be cited.

It is frequently found through a horizon of 11,500 feet, in beds

Cretaceous up through three divisions of the Tertiary; but no
particular bed of lignite is persistent over a large area. In one
instance—the Rock Springs group—eleven beds of lignite were
found, varying from 10 inches to 4 feet in thickness; but three
miles away, careful observation showed all these beds represented
by carbonaceous shales. In places separated by only a dis-
tance of a few miles, the succession of lignites is found to differ
materially; they appear in general to have been formed in small
irregular basins.

silver deposits which takes place when water containing chloride
of sodium reaches them. There is some saline material in the
ore. It is a singular fact that while there appears to be no trace
of copper in the ore, the washing from the quicksilver mills,
which runs into a pond and there evaporates, leaves a deposit
which is only 300 fine instead of 700, all the rest being copper.
To extract the silver, this deposit is put into a cap-like recep-
tacle of felt, and hot quicksilver is turned upon it, which strains
through, and carries with it the copper and gold, leaving the
silver. The next process is to separate the gold from the copper
in the drippings. To effect this the combined substance is heated
to fusion and allowed to cool, when the two metals segregate,
and the gold cracks off the copper. Before the discovery of this
process the "tailings" of the mills had no value; now they
prove of considerable worth.

that of mercury, between o° and 212°. In applying this simple
form of compensating pendulum to clocks, he states that it need
not add more than twenty or thirty cents to the cost of the pen-
dulum ordinarily in use. He has constructed one with more
perfect means of adjustment, yet very simple in character, which
he thinks can be attached to regulators and astronomical clocks.
Prof. Smith is now engaged in investigating any possible change
in the materials used that may interfere with the permanency of
this instrument; from the nature of the subject it will take some

Nov. 15, 1875.—Dr. Billwiller, of Zurich, contributes an article
on a local occurrence of the northerly " Fohn." It was formerly
believed that the Fohn came from the Sahara Desert, whence it
derived its warmth and dryness, but Hann showed a few years
ago that, according to known physical laws, descending air
becomes warmer and drier, that winds of the Fohn kind are not
confined to the Alps but occur in other mountainous regions,
and that the southern slopes of the Alps have a north wind,
which is the exact counterpart ot that called the Fohn. A mass
of observations made in Switzerland have since proved the cor-
rectness of his theory. Herr Billwiller, from the data he has as
jet examined, finds that isolated Fohn winds prevail only when
a broad current flows over the whole Alps in the same direction,
ascending on one side and descending on the other. But there
are cases in which no perceptible upward movement can be
traced on one side, and yet on the other the Fohn descends into
the valleys from above. A difference of density, olten great, is
the cause of this. The lower strata being obstructed the outflow
of air necessary to restore equilibrium comes from above. The
merely local Fohn blows strongly down a valley,but on reaching
the colder air of the plain mixes with it and quickly conies to
rest. Tables are [jiven showing meteorological conditions in
particular cases.—The next article, written by Dr. Wild, and
quoted here from the Annual Report of the Imperial Observatory

at St. Petersburg, is a review of the work of the Meteorological
Congresses of 1873 and 1874. Perhaps the most important
result of these congresses will be the general use of more trust-
worthy instruments by official and private observers. The fol-
lowing advantages have already been gained : an international
system ot ciphers for telegraphic despatches throughout nearly
the whole of Europe; an international form of publication in
the following countries: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Russia,
Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and part of Germany ; and lastly,
the establishment in many States of central institutions. We
shall thus obtain better, more uniform, and more accessible data
as a consequence of the late congresses.

Royal Society, Jan. 6—On the refraction of sound by the
atmosphere, by Prof. Osborne Reynolds, Owens College, Man-

is supported by a vertical wall towards Villejuif and surrounded
by a low rampart. Hence it is suggested that in all probability
the advantage of the gun at Montlhery was due to its being fired
over this parapet, while that at Villejuif was fired from the level
ground.
The fact that the wind blowing from Villejuif did not reverse
this advantage, suggested the possibility that at night, when the
diminution of temperature is downward, a light wind may not
produce the same effect upon sound as when the diminution of
temperature is upward, as it generally is during the day.
To ascertain if this is the case, some observations were made
on some calm nights in May and June of the present year, from
which it was found :—
(1) That the sky was cloudy and there was no dew. The
found of an electric bell I foot above the grass could always be
heard further with the wind than against it; but
(2) That when the sky was clear and there was a heavy dew,
the sound could invariably be heard as far against a light wind
as with it, and in some cases much further. On one occasion,
when the temperature at 1 foot above the grass was 38" and at
8 feet 47°, and the speed of the wind was 1 foot per second at

5 feet above the grass, the bell was heard 440 yards against the
wind and only 270 with it.
Since, therefore, on the nights of the experiments at Villejuif
and Montlhery it is stated that the sky was clear, that there was
dew, and the temperature recorded at the two stations shows the
diminution to have been downwards, it is argued that the effect
of the wind to render the sound less audible at Villejuif was
completely balanced by the downward refraction of temperature.
Another phenomenon recorded by Arago is, that while the
reports of the guns at Montlhery as heard at that station were
attended with prolonged echoes, this was not the case with those
at Villejuif. It is thought that this difference is sufficiently
accounted for by the fact that while Montlhery is surrounded by
high hills with precipitous or wooded sides, which must produce
echoes, the country in front of Villejuif is very flat and has not a
tree upon it for miles.
In concluding the paper reference is made to the Appendix to
the last Report of the American Lighthouse Board, in which
Dr. Henry, the Chairman, gives an account of his experiments,
extending over thirty years, and the conclusions to which they
have led him; both of which are in favour of the apparent
stoppage of the sound being due to refraction.

mining officers; but still, notwithstanding these improvements,
the explosions of fire-damp are sadly too frequent. The lament-
able events which have taken place within the last few weeks
clearly show that they sometimes occur without any great change
in the barometric pressure of the atmosphere, although undoubt-
edly sudden depressions in a barometer ought to caution miners
against emission of gas from the seam of coal and coal-wastes,
and put the men more on their guard at such times. It has been
stated in this Society that certain conditions of the atmosphere
quite irrespective of barometric pressure may have something to
do with causing the "drag" in the currents of air circulating
through a mine, as explosions have frequently occurred during
an east wind and a muggy state of the atmosphere, and a vesicu-
lar condition of water in the air has been suggested as the pro-
bable cause of this lessening of the speed of the air passing
through the galleries of mines. Now, careful observations with
a good anemometer in the return air-course of a mine ought to
determine whether or not such an effect is produced, and thus
settle this point by direct experiment. Another source of acci-
dents at this time of the year has to be taken into consideration.

demand for coal, and both managers and men are in a hurry to
increase the output, and under such circumstances probably there
may be sometimes not so much care and caution exercised as are
necessary for them to use in the dangerous work in which they
are engaged. In the management of a fiery mine, in my opi-
nion—1. There ought not to be any unveniilated wastes. 2.
The mixed use of Davy lamps and naked lights should not be
permitted where the former are commonly employed. 3. Wast-
ing of coal by gunpowder should not be sanctioned where Davy
lamps are in common use. 4. An anemometer under the care
of a competent man should be in constant use, in order to see
that a sufficient current ol air is passing through the workings to
insure perfect ventilation of the mine. 5. When there are
marked indications of firedamp in a mine, shown by a cap on
the flame of a lamp, the men engaged in hewing and drawing
coal should be removed from the pit until by ventilation the
place is cleared of gas and rendered safe for a working collier.
The above precautions may probably cause an increased cost in
the getting of coal, but they are necessary for the preservation
of human life if such catastrophes as now frequently "occur are
to be prevented. It is now pretty generally admitted that all
explosions of fire-damp are caused by there being too little pure
air and too much of that gas in a mine.—Chemical notes, by M.

First Notice.
THERE are several important scientific articles in this
third volume which we shall briefly notice, the
articles generally being quite up to the standard of the
preceding volumes. In this first notice we shall refer
especially to the articles "Birds" and "Biology." The
former article is the joint production of two authors,
Professors W. K. Parker and Alfred Newton.
Prof. Parker has undertaken the anatomical portion of
the subject. Allowing himself to be led away in the
direction of his favourite line of research, the author has
persuaded himself that in the space allotted to him for
his article " there is merely room for justice to be done to
one category of organs; and as the skeleton and espe-
cially the skull is of most direct importance to the zoolo-
gist and palaeontologist, and as its form determines, as it
were, all other organs ... it seems to be that on which
election should fall for the fuller treatment.* From this

opinion we disagree in toto. If the space allotted for the
subject is insufficient, it must be a fault of the general
management of the "Encyclopaedia." If the skull " deter-
mines, as it were," all other organs, then the study of ana-
tomy is on a very different footing from that on which it
seems to stand. By a glance at the earlier volumes of the
work, in which, as in the case of the article " Anatomy,"
by Prof. Turner, apparently unlimited space is allowed to
the author, we come to the conclusion that there is no
fault in the editorial department, in this direction at least.
As to the "determining" influence of the skull the true
relationship of three groups of birds—the woodpeckers,
toucans, and barbets — which will be found explained
below, is quite sufficient to demonstrate how unwarranted
is the assumption.
In 1867 Prof. Huxley propounded a classification of
birds, not entirely, but mainly based on the nature of a
portion of the palatal region of the skull. This valuable
addition to ornithological and zoological literature has
given a great stimulus to more minute investigation of
avian structure. It brought to light many new facts, and
placed prominently forward others previously too much
neglected. The classification was, however, only an arti-
ficial one, for, according to that author's own words in the
article " Biology " before us, "in an artificial classifica-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tion some prominent and easily observed feature is taken
as the mark of resemblance or dissemblance." The fea-
tures employed in this case were two—the fusion or non-
fusion of the maxillo-palatine plates of the maxillary
bones, and the shape of the vomer. In a hobby-run-wild
manner, Prof. Parker, in his article " Birds," has further
elaborated this artificial arrangement to a degree which,
more than anything else, demonstrates its untenability.
He begins by dividing the " Carinatae " into two sections,
firstly, the Dromaeognathae (Tinamous), and secondly
all the others ; because in the Tinamous the vomer is broad
behind and interposes between the pterygoids, the pala-
tines, and the basi-sphenoidal rostrum (which, however, is

also the arrangement in some of the penguins at least.)
Among the other carinate birds, Prof. Huxley's divisions
are retained, except that the woodpeckers are removed
from the .(Egithognathae to form an independent group of
equal importance with them, the Saurognathae! The
Desmognathae (Huxley), we are told, do not form a well-
collected group, and Prof. Parker does good service by

relative importance of the facts which are introduced is
weighed, adds a charm to the subject equal to that which
it already possesses. "Fossil Birds," " Sub-fossil Birds,"
'' Birds recently extirpated," "Birds partially extermi-
nated," " The Geographical Distribution of Birds," "Mi-
gration," " Song," "Nidification," " Eggs," and "Moult,"
are the headings of the various sections of his subject;
the whole occupying about fifty pages of the "Encyclo-
paedia;" that on Distribution being of considerably the
greatest length, as it is fairly exhaustive in its account of
the avifauna of the different regions. Speaking of the
general principles of zoogeography, first laid down by
Mr. Sclater in 1857, Prof. Newton remarks that "without
infringing upon what must be deemed the generalities of
biological distribution, it is proper to observe that Mr.
Scoter's success is to be attributed to the method in
which his investigations were carried on—a method in
which he had but few predecessors. Instead of looking
at the earth's surface from the point of view which the
geographer would take of it (a point of view which had
hitherto been adopted by most writers), mapping out the

world according to degrees of latitude and longitude,
determining its respective portions of land and water
entirely regardless of the products of either element, or
adhering to its political divisions—time-honoured as they
were—he endeavoured to solve the question simply as a
zoologist should, by taking up the branch of the subject
with which he was best acquainted, and by pointing out
and defining the several regions of the globe in con-
formity with the various aspects of ornithic life which
they present. But herein there was at once a grave diffi-
culty to be encountered. Birds being of all mammals
most particularly adapted for extended and rapid loco-
motion, it became necessary for him to eliminate from
his consideration those groups, be they large or small,
which are of more or less universal occurrence, and
to ground his results on what was at that time com-
monly known as the order Incessores, or Passeres, com-
prehending the orders now generally differentiated as
Passeres (vera-), Picaria, and Psittaci. On this basis, then,
Dr. Sclater was enabled to set forth "that the surface
of the globe exhibited six great regions," an account of
each of which is given in detail, with the light thrown
upon them by more modern research.
As might be imagined, the section on "Birds recently
extirpated" is a more complete and accurate rtsumt of

Reunion (Fregilupus varius), the Solitaire of Rodriguez
(Pezophaps solitarius), and the Crested Parrot of Mau-
ritius (Lophopsittacus tnauritiatms), being figured as well
as described.
The article "Biology" is by Prof. Huxley and Mr W.
T. T. Dyer. The subject is treated generally by the
former author in his well-known style, whilst Mr. Dyer
gives the principles of classification of the vegetable king-
dom as they are now understood by the most advanced
botanists.
Prof. Huxley classifies the phenomena of life under
four headings :—1. Morphology ; 2. Distribution; 3. Phy-
siology; and 4. Etiology. The last of these, from its
theoretical nature, presents features of more especial in-
terest. With reference to the doctrine of spontaneous
generation we read: "It has been pointed out at the
commencement of this article that the range of high tem-
peratures between the lowest, at which some living things
are certainly killed, and the highest, at which others cer-
tainly live, is rather more than ioo° Fahr. It makes no

and is apparently attached throughout, although its base
is covered a little by the crushed body; the right leg lies
below both the wings, and is apparently partially detached,
though but slightly, from the coxa?; the tibio-tarsal arti-
culation can be distinguished, but not the tarsal joints.
The wings are bent over downward in a position the
reverse of that of repose. The fore-wing covers the hind-
wiDg, as in nature, but to such an extent as to conceal
the greater part of it; the guttered portion of the inner
margin of the hind-wings is almost fully expanded, but
apparently has a fold next the submedian nervure. The
fringe of the fore-wing seems to be gone, but that of the
hind-wing is preserved nearly throughout. Head, fore
and middle legs, wings of the right side, and abdomen are
wholly wanting.
"The upper surface of the wing is, therefore, the part
which attracts most attention."
The above description throws an entirely new light
upon this fossil, and is exceedingly interesting.

nitis in Westwood and Hewitson's "Genera of Diurnal
Lepidoptera," a fact which Mr. Scudder considers of
some interest; the two groups, however, are widely sepa-
rated in some recent classifications, in which the struc-
tural relations of the genera of Satyrinee have received
special attention.
The Tertiaries of Radoboj afford another remarkable
fossil {Mylothriles plulo) which Mr. Scudder, differing
widely from all previous writers, refers, on we think insuf-
ficient grounds, to the sub-family Picrince, inasmuch as
the spots on the wings are not of the same simple cha-
racter as those of Hebomoia and allies, but are true ocelli,
the zones of which are clearly visible even in the drawing
on Plate II. (compare Figs. 14 and 17). The portion cf
a hind wing (Fig. 15) has been also somewhat rashly
referred to Mylot/irites, its venation being markedly dif-
ferent, and agreeing more nearly with the Eastern genus
Terinos than with any other group known to us.
Mr. Scudder seems to have indicated the correct posi-
tion of Collates proserplna and Potilia Freyerl. In the
case of the former, his task, owing to the obscure cha-
racter of the original, must, as he says, have been a
difficult one.
Spots on the wings, such as are represented on Plate 11.,
Fig. 5, are rarely to be met with among the Plcrina, but
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
do occur in some males of the genus Appias.
It is probable that Mr. Scudder is again correct with
regard to the position of Thelites rumlnlana, although the
general pattern, form of the wings, and large abdomen
are all far more like Dynastor or Castnla.
Thanaltes vetula and Patnphllites abdlta have mani-
festly the proper places assigned to them, and great credit
is due to the author for the labour which he has expended
in their determination.
Mr. Scudder*s conjectures respecting the "food-plants
of Tertiary Caterpillars" are exceedingly interesting, as
also his remarks on "the present distribution of Butter,
flies most nearly allied to fossil species." Asiatic forms
having the facies of Pamphilites abdlta are not, however,
as he supposes, unknown; the Urbtcoloj of East India
are perhaps not as yet largely represented in American
collections.
In his " Notice of Insects which have been erroneously
referred in recent times,\Xa Butterflies," Mr. Scudder

the left-hand page, and so above the plates, which are
immediately under the pupil's eyes. The printing and
the plates (the only figure that does not please us is the
oval on Plate II.) leave nothing to be desired.
We proceed to point out a few matters which we think
admit of improvement. Plate II. in the definition of a
circle invarying is used ; why not "constant?" The
construction of Fig. 6 (Plate IV.) is hardly satisfactory to
our view, though it is one very frequently given; the
tangent to the two" arcs is not obtained ,by a legitimate
method. We cannot make out the definition of an
harmonic mean given on Plate VII., but",the means are
correctly constructed. In Fig. 31 (text), for gh:ha,
read vice versa. We may remark that it is a curious fact
that the approximative consti uction given in Fig. 87 is true
in the cases of regular figures of three, four, and six sides.
In Fig. 99 (text) read "through f and E." In Fig. 113

object, on pure geometric grounds, to the constructions
in Figs. 278, &c, where a line is found equal to the semi-
circumference of a circle, &c.; also the inscribed circle
of a square and the inscribed triangle are stated as being
in the ratio, triangle : circle : square, as 2 : 3 : 4. In Fig.

to Fig. 297 (to draw a line to bisect any triangle from a

examination of it we have not satisfied ourselves of its
correctness. In Fig. 314, for x v, read z Y. In Fig. 316,

In Fig. 323 the limitations have not been laid down. In

creased in the ratio of unity to cos 8."
2. In order to disprove the correctness of the stated demon-
stration, I have measured the relative thermal energy of rays
projected in different directions from an incandescent metallic
disc, by the following method :—Fig. 2 represents section of a
conical vessel covered by a movable semi-spherical top, the vessel
being surrounded by a jacket through which water may be cir-
culated. A revolving circular disc, a a, composed of cast iron,
the back being semi-spherical and protected by fire-clay, is sus-
pended across the top of the conical vessel supported by
horizontal journals attached at opposite sides. The angular
position of the disc is regulated by a radial handle, />, connected
to one of the journals; the exact inclination to the vertical line
being ascertained by means of a graduated quadrant, d. An
instrument, e, capable of indicating the intensity of the radiant
heat transmitted by the incandescent disc, is applied at the
bottom of the conical vessel. The mode of conducting the
experiment is extremely simple. The movable cover and its
lining of fire-clay having been removed, the cast-iron disc is

heated in an air-furnace to a temperature of 1,800' F. It is then
removed by appropriate longs, and suspended over the conical
vtssel, the lining and cover being quickly replaced. The tem-
perature, shown by the instrument at the bottom of the conical
vessel, resulting from the action of the radiant heat of the disc,
is then recorded for every tenth degree of inclination. The inves-
tigation, it may be briefly stated, shows that the temperatures
imparted by radiation to the recording instrument is exactly as
the sines of the angles of inclination of the disc. 1 Ience, at an in-
clination of lo° to the vertical line, the temperature imparted to the
thermometer is scarcely one-sixth of tint imparted when the disc
faces the thermometer at right angles ; yet in both cases an tqual
amount of surface of an equal degree of incandescence is radiating
towarrsthe inslrument! Liplace and his followers have evi-
dently overlooked this important and somewhat anomalous fact,
proving that radiation emanating from heated bodies is incapable
of exerting full enegy in more than one direction. Our practical
experiments with the revolving incandescent disc have thus fully
demonstrated the truth of the proposition intended to be esta-
blished, namely, that the rays emanating from incandescent
planes do not transmit heat of equal energy in all directions, the
energy transmitted being as slated, proportionate to the sines of
their angle of inclination to the radiating surface.
3. The next step in the investigation of solar heat, belore
adverted to, was that of measuring the radiant energy trans-

mitted in a given direction by an incandescent solid metallic
sphere. For this purpose I employed a double conical vessel
similar to the one represented in Fig. 2, the incandescent sphere
being suspended over the conical vessel in the same manner as
the revolving disc The nature of the arrangement will be
readily understood by inspecting the annexed diagram, which
represents four spheres, Figs. 3, 4, 5. "nd 6, each sphere being
divided into four zones, A, B, c, and D, occupying unequal arcs,
but containing equal convex areas. Semi-spherical screens com-
posed of non-conducting substances were applied below each
sphere, provided with annular openings, arranged as shown in
the diagram. Through these annular openings the radiant heat
from the incandescent zones, i>, c, B, and A, was transmitted
to the thermometers, f, g, A, and k, respectively. Pere Secchi,
and other followers of Laplace, will be surprised to learn that
when the suspended sphere was maintained at a temperature of
t,Socf F., the radiation from the zone c, Fig. 4, imparted a
temperature of 27* '49 F. to the thermometer g, while the radia-
tion from the zone A, Fig. 6, imparted only 6°'io. F. to the ther-
mometer /•. Let us bear in mind that the radiating surface / m

tion, I devised the method described in Nature (vol. xii. p. 517),
showing that the polar and equatorial regions of the solar disc
transmit radiant heat of equal intensity to the earth, and that the
sun emits heat of equal energy in all directions. Adopting
Secchi's doctrine relating to the retardation suffered by calorific
rays in passing through atmospheres, viz., that the diminution
of energy is as the depth penetrated by the rays, it may also be
shown by an easy calculation based on the result of our investi-
gations, that the absorption by the solar atmosphere cannot
exceed one-seventh of the radiant energy emanating from the
photosphere.
5. Concerning the plan resorted to by the Director of the
Roman Observatory, and others, of investigating the sun's image
instead of adopting the method of direct observations, I will
merely observe that the information contained in the several
works of the Roman astronomer furnishes the best possible
guide in judging of the efficacy of image investigation. Let us
select his account of the investigations conducted between the
19th and 2j>d of March, 1S51. Having pointed out that in
these experiments it was impossible to approach within a minute
of the edge of the sun, and that during a later observation —

date not mentioned—he had approached within a minute, the
investigator observes: "But at this extreme limit, even making
use of the most accurate means of observation, we find difficulties
which it is impossible to overcome completely." In addition to
this emphatic expression regarding the difficulties encountered,
the author adds: "Moreover, it is impossible to study the edge
alone, for the unavoidable motions of the image do not admit of
its being retained at exactly the same point of the pile; we have
therefore been unable to push the exactness as far as we hoped;
and we have discontinued the pursuit of these researches, although
the results obtained are quite interesting." (Seerevised edition of
"Le So'.eil," vol. i. p. 205^ Tt is needless to institute a com-
parison betnem a system of w hich its founder speaks so despond-
ingly, and one which enables us to push our investigations to the
extreme limit of the solar disc, admitting of entire zones being

It will be recollected that the Society was originated in
1807, at a time when mineralogy was a fashionable study,
or at least when collections of minerals formed part of
the "furniture" of the apartments of the Queen and many
of the nobility. Collections of shells and of fossils were
also fashionable, but they were valued only for their
beauty or their rarity, and not for any knowledge of nature
they afforded. For some time the young society seems to
have followed fashion. Indeed, the value cf fossil organic
remains as giving a clue to the consecutive sequence and
relative order of strata was then but just beginning to be
understood. It was not till the end of 1799 that the first
MS. table of the sequence from the Carboniferous beds
upwards was constructed, and no map of the strata of
England was published till 1815. The earliest MS. cata-
logue of specimens belonging to the Society, begun in i3o8
or 1809, is labelled "General Catalogue of Minerals," and
some of the early entries of organic fossils refer rather to the
rock in which the fossil is imbedded ; the presence of the

fossil being but casually noticed, such as " limestone con-
taining shells." These early collections of fossils illus-
trating the labours of the first geologists in using organic
remains to trace the chronological sequence of beds, and
to compile some chapters of the earth's history, have a
profound interest, laying as they did the foundations of a
science which has placed at rest many wild theories of
the origin of the earth, and has, too, proved to be of such
practical value. The first donation recorded is Feb. 5th,
1808, of specimens from St. Anthon's Colliery, Newcastle-
upon-Tyne, by the Right Hon. Sir J. Banks. It would
occupy too much space to mention all the collections that
the Society has preserved, but among the donors are the
well-known names of Sir Henry de la Beche, Sir Charles
Lyell, Greenough, Warburton, and Sir Woodbine Parish.
McEnery's collection that first brought Kent's Cavem
into notice is there, and so is a splendid series of Daniel
Sharpe's " Brachiopoda." The old red sandstone fishes
presented by Lady Gordon Cumming are remarkable for
their beauty as well as for the extent of the collection.
Many distinguished living geologists have private col-
lections of their own; for example, the Earl of Ennis-
killen. Sir Philip Egerton, Prof. Prestwich, Mr. Searles

expected from the valuable work they have done. Prof.
Phillips, though so energetic a worker, is not largely
represented in the museum, for firstly York, and after-
wards Oxford, had stronger claims on him. The same
remark applies somewhat to the claims of the Wood-
wardian Museum on Prof. Sedgwick. As illustrating the
geology of England generally, the Jermyn Street Mu-
seum and the British Museum are more useful, but as a
record of early geological work the museum of the Society
is unique.

Majesty's services. Central Africa is not represented,

during its detention, and before it reaches the cylinder,
unless, in fact, the heat abstracted in condensation be
restored to it, the loss of power is very great. This has
hitherto been the stumbling-block of compressed air
engines, and M. Mckarski seems to have completely met
the difficulty. He adopts as a re-heater a cylinder hold-
ing about 100 litres of water, taken from the boiler of an
engine, at five atmospheres, and to obtain the maximum
of effect possible, the condensed air is delivered from the
reservoirs to the cylinder only after traversing the entire
mass of water.
By a clever contrivance M. Mckarski regulates at plea-
sure the action of the compressed air upon the piston.
Two hermetically-closed boxes are placed vertically upon
the re-heater; their common face is formed by a caoutchouc
diaphragm, in direct connection with an obturator, which
opens or shuts more or less the opening which communi-
cates between the lower box and the chamber containing
a mixture of compressed air and vapour in the upper part
of the hot-water cylinder. It will be seen that this orifice
will be more or less uncovered according as the pressure

in the lower box will be above, or not, the pressure in the
lower box. This second box is itself tilled with air, and
constitutes a small pump-barrel, in which a large plunger
piston works. The rod of the piston is a screw, and is
fitted outside with a small regulator, on which the driver
works. This may rapidly be made to vary the presence
of the air in the upper box, and consequently the pressure
be increased or diminished of the air which is delivered
from the lower box to the motory cylinder.
THE GREAT TELESCOPE OF THE PARIS
OBSERVATORY
VXTE have from time to time noted the progress of the
* * great telescope which for years has been in course
of construction for the Paris Observatory, and now that it
is completed and in its place we are glad to be able to
present a view of the instrument, for which, and for the
details which follow, we are indebted to La Nature.
In 1855 M. Le Verrier purchased in England two large
discs, the one of flint and the other of crown glass, intended
to form the material for an object-glass. The late Leon
Foucault, the eminent physicist of the Observatory, was
charged with the investigation of the processes which
should be employed to cut these large glasses, whose
dimensions were much greater than those to which opti-
cians had been accustomed. It is known how Foucault
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
was led, by his series of investigations, to make mirrors
of silvered glass. Successive attempts enabled him to
present French observatories with reflectors of 40, of 50,
and finally of 80 centimetres in diameter, having a tube
in length only six times the diameter of the mirror. The
largest of the telescopes constructed by Foucault himself,
of 80 centimetres aperture, is at Marseilles, under the
care of M. Stephan ; by means of it this astronomer has
seen all that Herschel saw with his enormous metallic
reflector of 1*45 m. diameter, all that Lord Rosse has been
able to see with his leviathan of 170 m., and he has added
hundreds of new nebula: to the list given by his illustrious
predecessors.
To crown his labours, L. Foucault wished to construct
the largest mirror which it would be possible to make
by his admirable method. This superior limit is via m.
diameter. M. Le Verrier caused to be cast at St. Gobain
a block of glass weighing 700 kilogrammes, which was
rough-ground and shaped in the workshops of MM. Sauter
and Lemonnier. But to construct this telescope, with
its tube of 16 metres in length, required special funds,

the telescope, suspended by its centre, must not bend
more than a millimetre in the most unfavourable positions,
according to the calculations by which M. Wolf determines
its dimensions. Experience has verified his calculations;
the two mirrors remain exactly centred upon each other
in all positions of the telescope.
It is necessary, however, to be able to direct the tube
toward any point of the sky, and it is necessary, more-
over, that when the star is once in the field of the
instrument, that should be able to follow it, by a simple
movement, in its apparent course through the heavens.
This is accomplished by what is called the equatorial
mounting of the telescope. This revolves on an axis,
cast of iron and steel, whose direction is parallel to the
axis of the celestial sphere. Then it may be inclined
more or less on this axis, by turning round in a second
axis of steel, which crosses the former at a right angle,
and partakes in its movement of rotation. The whole of
the arrangement of double axes, a veritable wonder of
mechanism, from the precision and ease of the movement,
weighs with the telescope 10,000 kilogrammes. Such is

the mass which, like the hand of a gigantic chronometer,
must follow with precision the march of the stars in the
vault of heaven, obedient to the action of clockwork, con-
trolled by a Foucault regulator.
To realise this wonder, M. Eichens had to put together
the most delicate apparatus of the mechanics of preci-
sion, and, preserving their delicacy intact, give them the
strength necessary to support great weights. We cannot
explain in detail the series of these wonders, tell how
friction is almost annihilated throughout, how all the
parts are in equilibrium, whatever be the position of the
telescope: how, in fine, at the same time that the instru-
ment follows the movement of the sky, the observer may
at his pleasure move it with perfect ease in all directions
by means of contrivances placed at his hand.
The perfection of mechanism would be nothing if it
did not serve the purpose of observing the stars with an
optical apparatus of equal perfection. Let us at once say
that the first attempts which have been made with the
instrument have completely satisfied the astronomers.
Not only has the mirror acquired, under the hand of M.
Martin, the rigorously parabolic form which gives it the
property of collecting in a single point the rays of a star,
but the very complex eye-piece, by means of which the
luminous point is observed, is itself without a single

defect. It now only remains to silver the surface of the
mirror, an operation at present easy, by the processes of
M. Ad. Martin, and which will be accomplished in a
large dish 1*30 metres in diameter. Meantime, the sur-
face of the polished glass reflects sufficient light to make
it possible to observe the most feeble stars; directed
towards the moon, the telescope concentrates in the eye
a light almost intolerable. It may be judged from this
what will be the brilliancy of celestial images when the
silvered mirror will throw upon the eye, not merely
scarcely one-half, but more than nine-tenths of the light
which it receives.
The comparison which we made above between the
Marseilles telescope of o'8o metre aperture and the
most powerful instruments elsewhere, allows us to predict
the results which science has a right to expect from a
telescope whose mirror is greater by half, and whose
mechanism has reached the latest limits of perfection.
M. Wolf, to whom the use of the telescope has been en-
trusted, proposes to employ it in observing the planets
and their satellites. At the same time the new telescope

arises from the imperfection, not of unisons, but of
wide-apart consonances, such as the third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, and octave.
This beat is well known practically to organ tuners,
and may be soon rendered appreciable to any musical
ear. Taking the fifth as an example, let the two notes

it, will increase in rapidity as the note is made more and
more out of tune. That this is not the same beat as
Tartini's is obvious from the failure of the rule for the
latter when applied to the former; for example, when the
concord is in tune the upper note vibrates 768, and the
lower one 512 vibrations per second, therefore there
ought to be 256 beats per second ; but in reality there are
no beats at all, they only begin when the notes are put
out of tune; hence the Tartini-beat rule is useless and
inapplicable in this case.
This beat may be called the consonance beat, and it
has also been termed " Smith's beat," from its having been
first investigated by him.
The theory of Smith's beat, as given by Smith himself,

is complicated and difficult to describe ; but we will en-
deavour to give some idea of its nature and cause.
We must return to the illustration of the coffin-makers.
Suppose one of them to have sold his business to another
man in the trade, who was so much more active and
energetic that he could drive his nails half as fast again
as ordinary workmen. Call him A, and suppose that
when he began to work it was found that he struck exactly
three blows to two of his neighbour B. As B struck 100
per minute, A will now strike 150. And assume that on
a certain day they both begin exactly together. The
passer-by will hear that every third blow of A exactly
coincides with every second of B; so that he will no-
tice fifty coincidences in a minute; or to describe them
more correctly, he will notice per minute fifty phases of
compound effects, in each of which there is a coincidence.
This phase constitutes Tartini's beat, but now very much
augmented in rapidity from what it was before: then
there were only one or two coincidences per minute, now
there are fifty.
Now suppose that A, from some slight exhilarating

which gives rise to the phenomenon in question. Smith
contrived, with profound ability, to account for and calcu-
late the beat independently of the Tartini beat, or what-
ever it may be called, but the introduction of this by De
Morgan has wonderfully simplified the comprehension of
the thing.
The accurate rule for finding how many beats per
second will result from the concord being any given
quantity out of tune; or for finding how much out of
tune any concord is when it makes a certain number of
beats per second, is remarkably simple.
Let n represent the denominator of the fraction, ex-
pressing, in the lowest terms, the true ratio of the concord
{e.g. for the fifth §, ;/ = 2; for the minor sixth $, n = $,
and so on) ; then let q = the number of vibrations per
second either in excess or deficiency of the number which
would make the interval perfectly in tune ; also let 0 =
the number of Smith's beats per second:
then 0 .

A few examples will show the easy application of these
formulas. Take the concord of the fifth,
When this is true the upper note should make 768 vibra-
tions per second to 512 of the lower one; but if it is
tuned by equal temperament the upper note will be
slightly flat, making 7&7'iS. Hence q = 0*85 ; and as
n = 2, we shall get /3 = 17, i.e. there will be 102 Smith's
beats per minute.
Again, suppose we find the concord of the major third

how much is it out of tune? As in this case n — 4, we

either more or less than it ought to do.

always the number of vibrations by which the upper note
is untrue:—

In the case of the unison, the Tartini beat and the Smith

why so many writers on beats have gone wrong; they
have so often taken unison sounds as the easiest and
simplest for popular illustration, and have either assumed,
without further investigation, that the same principles
would apply for other consonances also, or have omitted
notice of the other consonances altogether.

instead of i6o,j>. five vibrations too sharp, the two upper
E's in the treble stave will clash, and a beat will result.
In all these three cases Smith's beats also will natu-
rally be present, and it is curious that in each case when
we come to determine the rapidity of the beats, we find it
come out the same, whether we calculate it by Smith's
formula or by the unison beats of Helmholtz's overtones.
We have added the vibration-numbers to the notes, to
facilitate the calculation, and we find the number of beats
per second to be—
For the imperfect octave =5
For the imperfect fifth =10
For the imperfect major third =20
each arising from a sharpness of five vibrations in the
upper note of the concord.
Hence we may lay it down as a principle that in conso-
nances slightly out of tune, the beat given by the two
fundamentals on Smith's plan, and those given by the
first corresponding overtones on Helmholtz's principle,
are synchronous, and may be considered identical.
The two kinds of beats, however, must not be con-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
founded, as their cause is so distinct. The Helmholtz
beats arise from the overtones only, whereas Smith's ex-
planation applies to the fundamental notes, independently
of the overtones altogether.
Helmholtz notices (Ellis's translation, pages 302-3)
that beats of consonances will occur when sounded by
simple tones, but accounts for them in another and very
ingenious way, namely, by calling in the aid of the grave
harmonics, or, as he calls them, the combination tones.
Taking our first example of the octave consonance
given above, when the two notes of 128 and 261 vibra-
tions are sounded together, they will give rise to a com-
bination tone of 123 vibra'ions, and this, clashing with
the 128 note, will give beats at the rate of five per second.
For the next example, the consonance of the fifth, this
explanation will not suffice, and Helmholtz has to resort
to a cause of the second order, namely, the beat of a
grave harmonic, not with an imperfect unison, but with
an imperfect octave. Taking our former example, an
out-of-tune fifth C and G, of 128 and 197 vibrations re-
spectively; these two notes will give a combination or
difference tone of 69 vibrations, or an octave below the
C, but out of tune. Then Helmholtz says this lower C
will beat with its imperfect octave, on account of a new
or second order of difference-tones formed from them, as
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
in the former case.
In a similar but still more remote way, Helmholtz
accounts for the beats of other consonances, the fourth,
third, &c.
Without questioning the sufficiency of these explana-
tions, I must say they seem to me somewhat far-fetched,
and less satisfactory than Smith's, which account for the
beats by a more positive and direct method, without calling
in the aid of any sounds but the simple fundamental ones.
There is at any rate the satisfaction that whichever ex-
planation be adopted, the numerical value of the number
of beats per second comes out the same and agrees with
the fact; so that in a practical point of view it is imma-
terial which explanation be adopted.
I have alluded above to one important practical use of
beats, namely, in tuning; but there is another use of
them, also very interesting, i.e., that they furnish a means
of ascertaining the positive number of vibrations per
second corresponding to any musical note. This may be
done either by the unison or by Smith's beat, and I will
give both methods.

On the Action of Light on Tellurium and Selenium. By Prof.
W. G. Adams, F.R.S.
A small bar of tellurium, an inch long, whose resistance was
half an ohm, forming part of one of the resistances In a Wheat-
stone's Bridge, was exposed to the light of a paraffin lamp at a
distance of half a metre from it. At first, on exposure, the heat
from the lamp increased the resistance of the tellurium.
When a rectangular vessel of water was placed between the
lamp and the tellurium there was found, on exposing as before,
to be no perceptible change in the resistance. On removing the
rectangular vessel and putting a cylindrical beaker of water in its
place, so as to focus the light on the tellurium, the resistance of
the tellurium was found to be diminished.
When it had been kept in the dark for several days the tel-
lurium was much more sensitive to light. When exposed to the
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
paraffin lamp the resistance of the tellurium was now found to be
as much diminished without using the beaker of water as it had
previously been when the beaker was used. On introducing the
beaker of water between the tellurium and the lamp, the resist-
ance of the tellurium was still further diminished, the change
produced in the resistance by the exposure being aJjth part of
the whole.
When the selenium bar was exposed to the same lamp at the
distance of 1 metre, the change in the resistance was ^th of the
whole.
On exposing the selenium to a constant source of light at
different distances, the change in the resistance of the selenium
is inversely as the distance, ie., directly as the square root of the
illuminating power.

deposited over the Northern Hemisphere, by Mr. Henry Hicks.
In this paper the author, after pointing out the lines of depres-
sion explained in his former paper to the Society, now further
elaborated the views then propounded by him by carrying his
examination into the higher Palaeozoic series and into more exten-
sive areas. Beginning at the top of the Lower Silurian, where
he first recognises any evidence of a break in the Palaeozoic rocks,
he proceeded to show that this break was restricted to very
limited areas, and almost entirely confined to the parts which had
been first submerged, and where the greatest thickness of sedi-
ment had accumulated on both sides of the Atlantic, and hence
where the pre-Cambrian crust had become thinnest. On the
European side this break occurred where volcanic action had
taken place, and has doubtless to be attributed to the combined
action of upheaval of portions of the crust and the heaping up of
volcanic material, the latter in some cases forming volcanic islets
of considerable extent. He strongly objected to look upon these
breaks, even in the British area, where they are most marked, as
evidence of a want of continuity over other and far greater areas;
or to admit that even where there was conformity in the rocks at
this point, "great intervals of time are indicated, unrepresented

by stratified formations." The conformity found in extensive and
widely separated areas is proof also that a gradual contraction
took place of an enormous portion of the crust in the northern
hemisphere in Palaeozoic times; and the breaks at the close of
the Lower Silurian and in the Devonian are not indications of an
arrest in the general subsidence. After indicating the changes
which must have taken place in the climate from this gradual
spreading of the water and the evidence to be derived from the
consideration of the deposits and the faunas, the author drew the
following general conclusions :—1. That the condition of the
northern hemisphere at the beginning of Palaeozoic time was that
of immense continents in the higher latitudes, traversed by moun-
tainous ranges of great height, but with a general inclination of
the surface, on the one side (European) to the south-west and
south, and on the other side (American) to the south-east and
south. 2. That these continents were probably covered, at least
in their higher parts, with ice and snow; and that much loose
material had consequently accumulated over the plains and
deeper parts, ready to be denuded off as each part became sub-
merged. This would account for the enormous thickness of con-
glomerates, with boulders, grits, and sandstones, found in the
early Cambrian rocks, and also to a certain extent for their bar-
renness in organic remains. 3. That the depression over the
European and American areas was general from at least the lati-
tude of 30" northwards; that the parts bordering the Atlantic

were the first to become submerged ; the lower latitudes, also,
before the higher. 4. That the depression could not have been
less altogether, for the whole of the Palaeozoic, than 50,000 feet;
and that conformable sediments to that extent are found over
those parts of the areas first submerged, and which remained
undisturbed. That volcanic action was chiefly confined to parts
of the regions which became first submerged; that the imme-
diate cause of these outbursts was the weakness of the pre-
Cambrian crust at those parts, from the great depression that had
taken place, it being too thin there to resist the pressure from
within, and to bear the weight of the superincumbent mass of
soft sediment. 5. That the seat of volcanic action at this time
was at a depth of probably not less than twenty-five miles, as
sediments which were depressed to a depth of from nine to
ten miles do not indicate that they had been subjected to the
effect of any great amount of heat, and are free from metamor-
phosis. 6. That the climate at the early part of Palaeozoic time
was one of very considerable, if not extreme cold, and that it
became gradually milder after each period of depression. That

accurately arranged side by side. It is advisable always to
observe the image of the electric arc when comparing the spec-
tra of metals with that of the sun, rather than direct light. It is
also found very advantageous to place the poles of the lamp
at right angles to the slit, as by this means the long and short
lines in the spectra are more sharply defined than when ob-
served in the ordinary manner. In the photograph com-
paring the spectra of aluminium and calcium it is noticeable that
certain lines are common to the two, but those which are thick in
the aluminium spectrum are thin in that of calcium, and vice
versd. This depends on the quantities of impurity present. It
has thus been shown that there are no proper coincident lines in
the spectra of any two simple substances, and that there is no
substance spectroscopically pure. The relation between the
lengths of the lines and the amounts of metals employed to pro-
duce the spectrum convinced Mr. Lockyer that it would be pos-
sible to employ the spectroscope for quantitative analysis. The
earlier experiments in this direction were then referred to, as well
as those on which Mr. Lockyer has recently been engaged in con-
junction with Mr. W. Chandler Roberts, of the Royal Mint, with
a view to ascertain how far it is possible to detect small differ-

ences of composition in gold-copper alloys such as that used for
the coinage. The method employed was then described. It con-
sists in measuring, by means of a micrometer in the eye-piece of
a four-prism spectroscope, the relative lengths of certain gold and
copper lines when the image of an induction coil spark passing
from the alloy under examination is focussed on the slit. Al-
though the results obtained have not been uniformly comparable,
and therefore reliable, it is nevertheless certain that a difference of
composition as minute as the TTrtarstf1 Part is recognisable by this
means. Another method of spectroscopic research which Mr.
Lockyer next described was the study of the absorption spectra of
metals when they are not subjected to so violent an action as that
of the electric arc. Observations of this nature have been made
at low temperatures by Roscoe and Schuster, and by Mr. Lockyer,
and at the highest temperatures produced by the oxyhydrogen
blow-Dipe by the latter in conjunction with Mr. Roberts. These
experiments, which have been fully described in the Proceedings
of the Royal Society, show that the absorption spectra of metals
may be divided into five classes, which, for any particular metals,
depend on the amount of heat applied. They suggest that
in passing from the liquid to the most perfect gaseous state,
vapours are composed of molecules of different orders of com-
plexity; and that this complexity is diminished by the dis-
sociating action of heat, each molecular simplification being
marked by a distinctive spectrum.—The President inquired

whether the iridium line to which Mr. Lockyer had referred, and
by means of which the metal was originally discovered, -|was
absolutely identical with a hydrogen line. — Prof. McLeod
asked if Mr. Lockyer had found that the incandescence of the
air made any difference in the character of the spectra, and drew
attention to the advantage of a small lens placed in front of the
slit.—Mr. Woodward inquired whether any mechanical means
were adopted for ensuring that the lamp gave a constant
light while in the horizontal position.—Dr. Guthrie referred
to the spectrum observed when light traverses the vapours
resulting from the action of copper on nitric acid. He wished
to know whether the number of bands observed stands in
any relation to the number of possible oxides of nitrogen
at a given temperature ; or must one oxide of nitrogen be con-
sidered as being capable at that temperature of giving bright
and dark bands according to the way in which the light acts on
it ?—Mr. Lockyer, in reply to the president's question, said that,
so far, no difference has been observed between the refrangibility
of the hydrogen line and that of iridium. He is anxious to ascer-
tain whether any occluded hydrogen exists in the metal. Little

GEORGE POULETT SCROPE, F.R.S.
YET another of the old lights of Geology gone from
us !—one that shone out brightly more than half a
century ago, and has kept its place and done its work
even up to the last. At the ripe age of almost fourscore
years, and with his faculties and sympathies still fresh and
active, Mr. Scrope has passed away. Living his last
years in the quiet retirement of his pretty country-house,
he may be said to have taken some time ago his farewell
of the scenes of his early scientific friendships. But that
he kept up his interest in all his early pursuits was shown
by his occasional letters on geological matters, which
continued to appear until only a few weeks ago. The
friends with whom he corresponded and who saw him
from time to time in his retreat will not soon forget the
eagerness with which he listened to every new fact in his
favourite studies, and the friendly and large-hearted libe-
rality with which he stimulated and assisted younger
labourers in his own domain.
As far back as the winter of 1817-18 Mr. Scrope's
attention was drawn to geological pursuits by the acci-

dent of his residence at that time in Italy when Vesuvius
was in a state of constant eruption. Having leisure to
indulge his taste, he gave himself up to the task of watch-
ing the progress of the Neapolitan volcano. He was led
to extend his observations to the relics of older volcanic
vents in the same neighbourhood, and in the following
year spent some time among the Lipari Islands and in
Sicily. Having now learnt a great deal both of existing
and extinct volcanoes, he explored the old volcanic tracts
lying to the north of Naples and west of the Apennines,
and returned to England with a far larger experience of
volcanic phenomena than any of his contemporaries.
In this way he came to recognise how important a part
has been taken by volcanic action in the past, as well as
in the present, history of the earth. He was therefore
naturally surprised to find views of a totally opposite kind
not only in vogue, but advocated with a force and per-
sistence which refused to consider volcanoes as anything
more than modern and abnormal interferences with the
settled order of nature, and as of no more real significance
than subterranean coal-seams somehow set on fire. These
dogmas of the Wernerian school had gained such an
ascendency that many staunch adherents of that school—
men like G. B. Greenough, the founder of the Geological
Society—seemed to regard volcanoes with a kind of

personal dislike, and violently opposed any attempt to
elevate them into important geological agents. Mr.
Scrope, on his return to England, spent some time at
Cambridge; and finding his views supported and encou-
raged there, among others by Sedgwick, he determined to
give himself up to the study of a^district of extinct vol-
canoes, where the phenomena to be observed bore close
relation to those of the basalts and similar rocks of
Britain and Germany, and where nevertheless manifest
relics of true volcanic cones and craters existed. He
selected for this purpose the marvellously interesting tract
of Auvergne in Central France, and established himself
there in the summer of 1821. - A campaign of six months

made him thoroughly familiar with the volcanic geology
of that region, and enabled him to bring home such a
series of pictorial sketches and diagrams as could not, he
felt, but carry conviction home to even the sturdiest
Wernerian, that the basalt plateaux of Auvergne, instead
of being portions of the universal precipitate of a primeval
ocean, were in truth only fragments of lava-flows erupted

tone to the " Principles" of his friend and fellow-labourer
Lyell.
Two years after the "Considerations" appeared, Mr.
Scrope published his great monograph on the volcanic
districts of Central France—a work which placed him in
a high rank as an accurate and philosophical observer,
and one which did more, perhaps, than any other of its
day, to destroy the Wernerian prejudice against volcanoes,
and to establish the true volcanic origin of basalt rocks
of every age. In another respect it marked an epoch in
geological literature, inasmuch as it brought forward clear
and detailed proofs of the gradual excavation of valleys
by the action of the rivers still flowing in them—a doc-
trine taught indeed by Hutton, but for which there were
still needed those very proofs which Mr. Scrope's memoir
so admirably supplied.
After this early promise of an active and brilliant scien-
tific career, Mr. Scrope's energies passed over into another
and wholly different mode of life. He entered Parlia-
ment, and continued an active member for some thirty-
four years. So thoroughly did he give himself up to

political questions, that for fully a quarter of a century he
seems to have retired from science altogether. About
twenty years ago (1856), finding that the old notion of
Humboldt and Von Buch about volcanic craters being
merely big tumours or blisters pushed out by the expan-
sion of the subterranean vapours, was still sufficiently in
vogue to call forth an active opposition from Lyell, Mr.
Scrope, who had long before exposed the untenability of
this dogma, returned to his first love, and produced a
paper upon "Craters and the Nature and Liquidity of
Lavas." Other papers of a similar kind followed. In
1858 he brought out a second and revised edition of his
memoir on the Auvergne volcanic region, and in 1862 he
published a second—much altered and improved—edition
of his general work on volcanoes. Since then he has
communicated from time to time numerous brief letters
and notices on his favourite subjects, showing how fully
he retained his firm grasp of all that related to volcanic
geology, and how young and fresh he could keep his
powers.
This brief notice of his labours may fitly end with a
tribute to that courtesy and kindliness which ever marked
his relations with other men. A more leal-hearted friend
could not be. How gladly would he say a kind word
when a kind word would be of service! How ready, too,

The founders of English geology have been truly a
noble band—generous, helpful, and enthusiastic; but few of
them will be more sincerely mourned than George Poulett
Scrope. A. G.
SOMERSET HOUSE AND THE PUBLIC

EVER since the proposal was first made that disputed
cases under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act should
be referred to the analysts of the Board of Inland Revenue
as adjudicators, there has been a strong feeling in the
minds of most persons competent to form an opinion on
the subject, that should such a course be ultimately
adopted, the probable results would be great dissatisfac-
tion on all sides. It was foreseen that the gentlemen
most meritoriously engaged at Somerset House in testing
the strength of alcoholic liquors, in examining the genuine-
ness or otherwise of tobacco, tea, and excisable articles
generally, and such like pursuits, would have great cause
for complaint if work out of their ordinary department

name of " Butterine." He also stated that his method of
analysis was one unknown outside the Inland Revenue
laboratory, and that the only test on which he placed
much reliance was the specific gravity of the fatty matter,
whilst he had been unable from the few experiments he
had made to corroborate the statement of Messrs. Hehner
and Angell, that genuine butter fat never yields more
than about 86 per cent, of fatty acids on saponification.
Although the case could not be reopened, the evidence
of several Public Analysts who had examined the sample
was taken, and in most respects distinctly showed that the
secret method of examination adopted by Mr. Bell was
utterly unreliable. Dr. Dupre", F.R.S., Mr. Wigner, and
Mr. de Konigh each found that the butter-fat contained
close upon 94 per cent, of fatty acids, genuine butter not
yielding more than 86, and ordinary fats giving about 95
per cent. On microscopic examination a crystalline
structure (evidence of fusion) was noticeable; the melting
point was 4° C. lower than genuine butter; the matter
mistaken by Mr. Bell for cascine was no such substance,
but only fragments of woody tissue and similar vegetable

organised matter; the physical structure of the substance
was different from that of genuine butter, as it possessed
on the tongue the peculiar granular feeling of " butterine,"
and also tasted like the latter. The same results were
also arrived at by other analysts, six having examined
the sample, and all agreeing with Dr. Muter that the sub-
stance contained either no butter at all or very little.
On the other hand, Mr. Harkness and Mr. Lewes
(assistant to Mr. Bell) stated that they could see no
crystals under the microscope, but admitted that woody
fibre and other vegetable matter was present.
Finally, the case was dismissed, the Vestry being
ordered to pay the costs of the Somerset House analysis;
the magistrates, however, consented to grant a case for
appeal if the Vestry desired to adopt that course.
Comment on the above would seem almost superfluous;
but the question naturally arises, of what use is it in
Government taking up valuable time in passing Acts, and
in counties, districts, and parishes going to the expense of
appointing analysts in accordance with these Acts, if the
operations of these gentlemen are to be rendered nugatory
by being liable to be overthrown by appeal to an authority
which, however competent in reference to its own parti-
cular department, is nevertheless by its own showing
scarcely possessed of sufficient experience, and is cer-

tainly not of sufficient standing and position to be ad-
missible as a final adjudicator on such matters? The
position of Public Analysts was surely bad enough
without this indignity and injustice ; most of the offices
are grossly underpaid; the appointments are often in the
hands of persons utterly incompetent to judge of the re-
spective merits of candidates, and who not infrequently
elect, not the applicant of highest scientific and profes-
sional standing, but the one who sinks his self-respect
lowest by canvassing and flattering the electors. As a
consequence many of the best known chemists refuse to
have anything to do with such appointments, and the
public loses the chance of valuable services. Further,
when mistakes and blunders are made by persons who
never ought to have been elected at all, there is a gene-
ral cry against "the incompetence of Public Analysts,"
and discredit is brought on the whole class, worthy and
unworthy alike. The inevitable results of insisting upon
the analysts of Somerset House or any other set of

writer attempts to prove "that primeval man commenced
his career six or eight thousand years ago in a civilised
condition in the temperate regions of the East." In it the
irresponsible dicta of anonymous journalists, and the
records of local societies in America, Britain, and France,
unchecked by criticism, are taken to be of equal value
with those facts which have run the gauntlet of the criti-
cism of the civilised world, and not been found wanting.
A work written in this manner must necessarily be a
huge pile of wheat and chaff, in which the former can
only be got at by a process of careful winnowing. In
this particular case we fail to discover any wheat which
has not been taken out of somebody else's barn.
Mr. Southall tells us, in his preface, that he is the
champion of the Bible against the speculations of
"Science," and that as such he is very much hurt "that
many literary and scientific men should avoid mention of
the Hebrew Scriptures.* "I do not recollect^" he writes,
"that'The Antiquity of Man' even recognises that the
Book of Genesis is in existence; and yet every one is
perfectly conscious that the author has it in mind and is
writing at at it all the time." This quotation illustrates
the spirit of the book and the one-sidedness of the
writer. Why should Sir Charles Lyell include Gene-
sis among his geological evidences as to the anti-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
quity of man, and enter into the barren discussion which
has been before the world for the last half century?
Mr. Southall does not recognise the fact that even if he
proves scientific men to be wrong he does not add to the
authenticity of the Scriptures, or that even if man be but
six or eight thousand years old, that fact again is a point of
small importance, except as relates to Archbishop Usher's
chronology. We for our part protest against the assump-
tion in this work that there is any real antagonism between
religion and science, and we believe that its writer has
contributed perhaps the most elaborately untrustworthy
contribution to a dead controversy which has yet been
made; for in it are involved, as in a great whirlpool, facts
relevant and irrelevant-—every waif and stray, in fact, that
has come within'its reach. And these are carried round
so swiftly that it is almost impossible for the reader to see
clearly whither the argument is tending. Of course Mr.
Darwin and the doctrine of evolution are drawn in, which
the author takes to imply " that Napoleon Buonaparte was
evolved from a Corsican crab," and which we respectfully
decline to discuss in this connection.

which have been accepted and then given up by scientific
men. Having thus discredited their judgment, he pro-
ceeds to contradict himself as to the conclusions of Evans,
Lubbock, and Lyell with regard to the division of time
past, before the dawn of history, into the stages of rude
stone, polished stone, bronze, and iron. A large portion
of the book, the entire argument, so far as we can make
it out, is devoted to proving that these stages were simul-
taneous, and not older than the six' or eight thousand
years of history and tradition. In p. 400 he allows that
they are consecutive almost as distinctly as Mr. Evans.
In proving that "the ages" are simultaneous he adopts
the same kind of reasoning as that by which Mr. Fergus-
son arrives at the post-Roman age of the Megalithic monu-
ments, and Mr. Wright concludes that the Britons during
the time of the Roman invasion used bronze swords. It
is a very simple process. You find a certain set of things
in a cave, in a cairn, or a tumulus, or in diggings
near a Roman station, and you at once conclude that
they were used at the same time by the same people-

In every one of the cases cited there is no proof that
the deposit in which the articles occur has not been
disturbed. Before any association of the kind quoted
is of the least value we must be certain that there has
been no subsequent disturbance ; such proof, for example,
as we get in some of the pile-dwellings of Switzerland;
such proof as we do not get at Solutre', where a Mero-
vingian cemetery happened to be planted on an old
"station"of the Palaeolithic age, as the writer of this
review was informed by Dr. Broci at the French Asso-
ciation at Lyons in 1873. In this case, which is made
the basis of the attack on the high antiquity of PaUeo-
lithic man, the human skulls are comparatively modern,
and the refuse heap of an untold age.
We have followed Mr. Southall into a labyrinth, and we
have been unable to find a single shred of proof of the
recent origin of man. We lay down his book with regret
that he should have expended so much labour, with the
practical result of leading the unwary reader into errors
as to facts—for example, that Busk stated the Cave-bear
to be identical with the Grizzly, or that Brandt believes
that the Irish Elk lived in Central Europe down to the
fourteenth century, two cases which occur to us. We

The Article "Birds" in "Encyclopaedia Britannica"
Mr. Garrod's article on the new edition of the "Encyclo-
pcedia Britannica" in last week's Nature contains the following
passage:—
"As another example of the different teaching of the artificial
and the natural classifications, the Swifts (Cypselidu-) and the
Humming Birds (Troch'Uidte) may be referred to. These two groups,
from the details of their internal structure when examined one
by one, are most certainly related as intimately as are the Wood-
peckers with the Toucans. There is, in fact, not a family
difference between them, and yet, from their palates, Professors
Huxley and Parker place them in quite different divisions, be-
cause the vomer is truncated in the one and pointed in the
other."
In a previous part of the article Mr. Garrod refers to my
paper on the Classification of Birds, published in the Pro-
ceedings of the Zoological Society in 1867, which he criticises
as if he had studied it with a care proportioned to the labour it
cost. Nevertheless, I can but think that his acquaintance with
its contents must be somewhat superficial, inasmuch as any care-

ful reader will find at p. 459, the following passage under the
head of Cypselomorplut, or Swift-like birds :—
"This group contains three very distinct families—the Tro-
chilide, the Cypselidie, and the Caprimiilgidte. The first two
families have a length of the manus and a brevity of the humerus
which is peculiar to themselves."
Thus, so far from placing the Swifts and the Humming Birds
in "quite different divisions," I placed them in the same divi-
sion, and took pains to point out their close affinity; and in
asserting the intimate relations of the Cypselidie and Trochilida,
Mr. Garrod is reiterating a view which, unless I mistake,
was first definitely put forward by myself, and not, as the
readers of his article would be led to imagine, controverting my
opinions.
Mr. Garrod takes pains to show that "the structure of the
skull does not alone suffice to determine the mutual affinities of
birds." The implication appears to be that Mr. Parker and I
assert the contrary. I have no right to speak for Mr. Parker,
but 1 may remark that my knowledge of his works would not
have led me to Mr. Garrod's conclusion, while it would have
compelled me to treat any opinion of his, however much I

"History of Creation." But, according to a recent reviewer* ef
the said work, this is what he says of the "true nature of
Lichens":—" Every Lichen is really composed of two distinct
plants: of a low form of Fungus (Ascomycetes), which lives as a
parasite upon the former (?), and upon the nutritive substance
prepared by it. The green cells, containing chlorophyll (Gonidia),
which are found in every Lichen (?), belong to the alga. But the
colourless threads (Hyphse), which, densely interwoven, form the
principal mass of the body of the Lichens, belong to the parasitic
fungus." (Vol. ii. p. 95.) Now, says the reviewer in question,
'' This doctrine, so dogmatically put forth .... is adopted
but by a few outside of the extremely Hypothetical school
of German botanists; and by the best Cryptogamists of this
country and of the Continent is considered a pure Delusion : " a
verdict much nearer the truth, it must be confessed, than the
assertion that Prof. Schwendener has "cleared up" the "true
nature of Lichens." Among "the best cryptogamists of this
country " who have expressed themselves as unconvinced by, or
opposed to, the dogmata of Schwendener and his admirers,
regarding the " true nature of Lichens," are Berkeley, Thwaites,
and Cooke—than whom we have certainly no botanists better

qualified or entitled to form or to offer opinions on such a subject.
The views of Berkeley and Thwaites are referred to in Nature
(vol. x. p. 541) as having been expounded before the Royal
Horticultural Society; while those of Cooke are set forth vigo-
rously in his recent "International Scientific Seiies " volume on
"Fungi." See also what the sagacious President of the Lin-
naean Society (Bentham) says on this subject—ex cathcdri, and
therefore summing up judicially—in his anniversary address for
1873 (Proceedings of the Society for May 1873, p. 28) :—"There
is one part of Sachs' book t (says he) which is an illustration
of a very common readiness to take at once as proved anyparadox
or theory opposed to general belief, when a new discovery ap-
pears to afford some plausible argument in its favour. In the article
Lichens ... he adopts, as an established fact, Schwendener's
view that Lichens are Fungi parasitical upon Alga; ... a series
of conclusions founded on a very small number ol facts . . . They
require much observation and study before the conclusions
derived from them can be taught as an established Theory. And
whatever be the result, the Group of Lichens is so distinct in its
vegetative characters, and at the same time so extensive and
varied a one, that it seems more methodical to treat it, as hereto-
fore, as a distinct class,* than to absorb it in that of Fungi, notwith-
standing the close affinity shown by its reproductive organs."
But other German botanists themselves, not inferior in status
or experience to Prof. Schwendener, regard, as Bentham does,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the Hypothesis that Lichens are the product of a union of Parasitic
Ascomycetes with Algie as far from being proved. For instance,
Prof. De Bary, of Halle, and Dr. Stizenberger, of Constance,
point this out in the Botanische Zeitung for 1870 (pp. 42 and 53).
If, by artificial cultivation, such a Union could be made to produce
a Lichen, the Theory might be held as proven. But this has not
yet been effected, and I venture to think and say it never will be.
There are several difficulties in the natural history of Lichens
with which the Schwendenerians have to deal, and which they
have not yet, so far as I know, explained away. For instance,
the case of Athalhne Lichens that have neither Hypha; nor
Gonidia—neither fungoid nor algoid elements—assuming Hyphse
to be necessarily fungoid and Gonidia to be algoid ; Lichens that
are represented only by Apothecia, which are avowedly lichenoid:
though they too may be claimed for the Alga', inasmuch as
Archer has a recent paper "On Apothecia occurring in some
Scytonematous and Sorisophonaceous.Algoe in addition to those
previously known." §
In short, the mantle of Bayrhoffer appears to have fallen on
Schwendener ; and his Parasitic Theory is merely the most recent
instance of German transcendentalism applied to the Lichens!

THE FLOWERING OF SPR/NC PLANTS
D'
URING the past twenty years the Scottish Meteor-
ological Society has been collectin; data relative to
the budding, leafing, flowering, and deoliation of trees
and plants, and to the migrations of bins in connection
with the periodical return of the seasons and it was pro-
posed some time ago to discuss the maerial which has
been accumulated. As preliminary, however, to this very
difficult line of inquiry, it was resolved b discuss in the
first place the observations which have ben made by Mr.
McNab on the flowering of spring plant in the open air
in the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Gardei during the past
twenty-six years, and which have been Dublished in the
Transactions of the Botanical Society of Idinburgh. These
observations have been made by the sane observer on the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
same plants, growing in the same sitintions, during the
whole of the twenty-six years.
The average day of flowering of thirty-two spring
flowers has been determined, of which the following are
examples :—Galanthus nivalis, Jan. 25; Eranthis hye-
r/ia/is, Jan. 30; Htpatica triloba, Jan. ji; Cory lies Avel-
lava, Feb. 2 ; Rhododendron atrovirms, Feb. 3; Crocus
susianus, Feb. 4 ; Lcucojum vermin, Feb. 10 ; Daphne
Mezereum, Feb. 22; Narcissus pumilts, March 10; Oro-
bus vernus, March 11 ; Muscati hotryoides, March 18;
Rides sanguineiim, March 22; Narissus pseudo-Nar-
cissus, March 31 ; and Fritillaria imyrtalis, April 1.
The lateness or earlincss of the dfferent springs, as
determined from the times of flowering of the thirty-two
plants in each year, is considerable. The latest spring
was 1855, which was thirty days later than the average,
and the earliest 1S74, which was twenty-three days earlier,
thus giving a difference of fifty-three days between the
latest and earliest springs during tie past twenty-six
years. As regards particular (lowers,the deviations are
much greater. The largest deviation from the average

purple, 94; blue, 87 ; green, 51 ; and miscellaneous, 38.

centages of that colour which has come into flower by each
month from April to July, we obtain the following results
for the first five classes :—

Thus of these colours, the blues are, on the average,
considerably the earliest in flowering; then follow in
order the -whites and the purples, and lastly the yellows
and rids. It follows that the plants included in the
British flora clearly tend to arrange themselves, as
regards the dates of flowering, in the order of the colours
of the spectrum, the average earliest being those which
are nearest the part of the spectrum where the actinic
rays are at the maximum. It will be observed that the
differently-coloured varieties of Scilla bifolia are in the

same order of flowering of the plants of the same colours
in the British flora. Accurate observations, continued
from year to year, of the exact dates of flowering of
different plants, and particularly of differently-coloured
varieties of the same species, could not fail to contribute
valuable data to the inquiry referring to the influence of
the solar rays, in the development of the more important
of the vital functions of plants in different seasons. Whilst
it is quite true, as has been pointed out by Mr. R. A.
Pryor in NATURE (vol. xiii. p. 150), that flowers of all
colours bloom in any of the spring or summer months, it
is plain that it is only the method of inquiry by averages
that can guide us in the search for the law or laws which
regulate the seasonal distribution of colour among flowers.
It is scarcely necessary to refer to the importance of this
question in its possible applications in the rearing of
early and late varieties of flowers and fruits.

pulley, g, over which is passed a cord with a scale at its
pendant extremity, while the other end is attached to the

A second series of experiments was made, with the arm
of the beam in any position with reference to the cord.
A simple arrangement—wooden triangle with arc-division
—served for measuring the angle which the axis of the
beam-arm formed with its normal position (in which it
forms a right angle with the cord). From the observed
values of this angle, and from the quantities already
referred to, the number obtained for the mechanical equi-
valent of heat was 4267, with a mean error ± 5-9.
The apparatus is especially to be recommended for
lecture-experiments, because the method of experimenting
is extremely simple, and the carrying out of the experi-
ment takes very little time. A single experiment occupies
30-60'. S. W.
THE PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY ON THE
PIC DU MIDI
AT a recent sitting of the Paris Academy of Sciences
M.Ch. Sainte-Claire Deville made a communication!
with reference to the proposed Physical Observatory on the
Pic du Midi, in the Pyrenees. He referred to the
increasing importance of meteorology, and to its manifold
extensions and development in recent years, and to the
growing necessity of establishing numerous fixed stations
at as high an altitude as is practicable. This has already
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
been done to a considerable extent in India, in America,
and in some parts of Europe; in France, as we have
already intimated, the Puy de Ddme Observatory is
nearly completed. M. Deville then referred to the im-
portance of having a station on the Pyrenees, and to the
difficulty of choosing a suitable site. The Pic du Midi de
Bigorre, however, unites in itself all the most favourable
circumstances. Situated towards the middle of the chain
of the Pyrenees which receive directly the shock of the
Atlantic storms, the Pic du Midi stands out from the
general crest, and rises to a height of 2,877 metres,
only 527 metres below the highest summit of the chain.
It commands a magnificent and extensive panoramic
view, and is easily accessible from various points. From
the sixteenth century downwards it has attracted tee
attention of men of science, and during the last and th-
present century a considerable nunyber of notable ob
servers have resorted to the Pic for the purpose of carrying
on observations. Darcet, in 1786, obtained from Philippe
d'Orleans the promise of 80,000 francs to found an obser-
vatory on the mountain, but the political events which

peak, for the purpose of making barometric observations.
In 1854 a society at Bagneres founded on the Col de
Sencours, 511 feet below the Pic, on a hill immediately
above the Lake Oncet, a hotel for tourists. It is this
hotel which the Ramond Society has used as a temporary
observatory, until the Government provide the means of
erecting a proper building on the summit of the Pic. On
August 1, 1873, the Commission appointed by the Society
provided a tolerably complete set of meteorological appa-
ratus on the Col de Sencours. Regular observations
were carried on till October 10, when want of funds cut
them short. On June 1 of the following year an observer,
along with the President of the Commission, General de
Nansouty, installed themselves and remained till Decem-
ber 25, when, as we recorded at the time, the severity of
the winter, for which they were insufficiently provided,
compelled them to beat a precipitate retreat. On June 1

damage to the meteorological hut, and injured several of
the instruments; fortunately, however, the observers
managed to repair most of the damage done. The in-
struments which have been provided are of the best kind,
and already observations of great value have been made,
some of which have been published by the Ramond Society.
This Society determined to accomplish the erection of
a proper observatory on the Pic du Midi itself, and has
appealed to every quarter from which funds are likely to
be obtained. The work of construction has already been
begun. The building will be composed of three parts.
The dwelling-house, situated seven metres below the sum-
mit, is in part subterranean, and will open only on the
south side. It communicates by a tunnel with a circular
vaulted erection, which will contain the barometer, the
magnetic apparatus, &c. At a little distance will be
solidly built the Montsouris hut, intended to cover the
instruments which must be subjected to the direct influ-
ence of the atmosphere.
The work is thus in progress, and there is every reason
to believe that it will soon be successfully completed, and
the station become one of the most important physical
observatories, not only in France, but on the globe.

THE author refers in an introduction to an inquiry on
the decomposition of vapours and the formation of
actinic clouds by light, whereby he was led to experiment
on the floating matter of the air. He refers to the ex-
periments of Schwann, Schroder and Dusch, Schroder
himself, to those of the illustrious French chemist Pas-
teur, to the reasoning of Lister and its experimental
verification, regarding the filtering power of the lungs;
from all of which he concluded, six years ago, that the
power of developing life by the air, and its power of scat-
tering light, would be found to go hand in hand. He
thought the simple expedient of examining by means of a
beam of light, while the eye was kept sensitive by dark-
ness, the character of the medium in which their experi-
ments were conducted, could not fail to be useful to
workers in this field. But the method has not been much
turned to account, and this year he thought it worth while
to devote some time to the more complete demonstration
of its utility.
He also wished to free his mind, and if possible the
minds of others, from the uncertainty and confusion which

We have here the oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid,
ammonia, aqueous vapour, and all the other gaseous
matters which mingle more or less with the air of a great
city. We have them, moreover, "untortured" by cal-
cination and unchanged even by filtration or manipula-
tion of any kind. The question now before us is, can air
thus retaining all its gaseous mixtures, but self-cleansed
from mechanically suspended matter, produce putrefac-
tion? To this question both the animal and vegetable
worlds return a decided negative.
Among vegetables experiments have been made with
hay, turnips, tea, coffee, hops, repeated in various ways
with both acid and alkaline infusions. Among animal
substances are to be mentioned many experiments with
urine; while beef, mutton, hare, rabbit, kidney, liver, fowl,
pheasant, grouse, haddock, sole, salmon, cod, turbot,
mullet, herring, whiting, eel, oyster have been all subjected
to experiment.
The result is that infusions of these substances exposed
to the common air of the Royal Institution laboratory,
maintained at a temperature of from 60° to 700 Fahr., all
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
fell into putrefaction in the course of from two to four
days. No matter where the infusions were placed, they
were infallibly smitten. The number of the tubes con-
taining the infusions was multiplied till it reached six
hundred, but not one of them escaped infection.
In no single instance, on the other hand, did the air,
which had been proved moteless by the searching beam,
show itself to possess the least power of producing Bac-
terial life or the associated phenomena of putrefaction.
The power of developing such life in atmospheric air, and
the power of scattering light, are thus proved to be in-
dissolubly united.
The sole condition necessary to cause these long-dor-
mant infusions to swarm with active life is the access of
the floating matter of the air. After having remained for
four months as pellucid as distilled water, the opening of
the back-door of the protecting case, and the consequent
admission of the mote-laden air, suffice in three days to
render the infusions putrid and full of life.
That such life arises from mechanically suspended par-
ticles is thus reduced to ocular demonstration. Let us
inquire a little more closely into the character of the par-
ticles which produce the life. Pour Eau de Cologne into
water, a white precipitate renders the liquid milky. Or,
imitating Briicke, dissolve clean gum mastic in alcohol,

and drop it into water, the mastic is precipitated, and
milkiness produced. If the solution be very strong the
mastic separates in curds; but by gradually diluting the
alcoholic solution we finally reach a point where the
milkiness disappears, the liquid assuming, by reflected
light, a bright cerulean hue. It is, in point of fact, the
colour of the sky, and is due to a similar cause, namely,
the scattering of light by particles, small in comparison
to the size of the waves of light.
When this liquid is examined by the highest micro-
scopic power it seems as uniform as distilled water. The
mastic particles, though innumerable, entirely elude the
microscope. At right angles to a luminous beam passing
among the particles they discharge perfecily polarised
light. The optical deportment of the floating matter of
the air proves it to be composed, in part, of particles of
this excessively minute character. When the track of
a parallel beam in dusty air is looked at horizontally
through a Nicol's prism, in a direction perpendicular to
the beam, the longer diagonal of the prism being vertical,
a considerable portion of the light from the finer matter is

NATURE
The experiments with calcined air took another form.
Six years ago it was found that to render the laboratory
air free from floating matter, it was only necessary to per-
mit a platinum wire heated to whiteness to act upon it for
a sufficient time. Shades, containing pear juice, damson
juice, hay- and turnip-juice, and water of yeast, were
freed from their floating matter in this way. The in-
fusions were subsequently boiled and permitted to remain
in contact with the calcined air. They are quite un-
changed to the present hour, while the same infusions ex-
posed to common air became mouldy and rotten along ago.
It has been affirmed that turnip- and hay-infusions
rendered slightly alkaline are particularly prone to
exhibit the phenomena of spontaneous generation.
This was not found to be the case in the present in-
vestigation. Many such infusions have been prepared,
and they have continued for months without sensible
alteration.
Finally, with regard to infusions wholly withdrawn from
air, a group of test-tubes, containing different infusions,
was boiled under a bell-jar filled with filtered air, and
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
from which the air was subsequently removed as far as
possible by a good air-pump. They are now as pellucid
as they were at the time of their preparation, more than
two months ago, while a group of corresponding tubes
exposed to the laboratory air have all fallen into rotten-
ness.
There is still another form of experiment on which
great weight has been laid—that of hermetically sealed
tubes. On April 6 last, a discussion on the "Germ
Theory of Disease" was opened before the Pathological
Society of London. The meeting was attended by many
distinguished medical men, some of whom were profoundly
influenced by the arguments, and none of whom disputed
the facts brought forward against the theory on that
occasion. The following important summary of these
was then given :—" With the view of settling these ques-
tions, therefore, we may carefully prepare an infusion from
some animal tissue, be it muscle, kidney, or liver; we
may place it in a flask whose neck is drawn out and
narrowed in the blowpipe-flame, we may boil the fluid,
seal the vessel during ebullition, and keeping it in a warm
place, may await the result, as I have often done. After
a variable time the previously heated fluid within the her-
metically sealed flask swarms more or less plentifully with
Bacteria and allied organisms."

Previous to reading this statement the author had
operated upon tubes of hay- and turnip-infusions,
and upon 21 tubes of beef, mackerel, eel, oyster, oat-
meal, malt, and potato, hermetically sealed while
boiling, not by the blowpipe, but by the far more
handy spirit-lamp flame. In no case was any ap-
pearance whatever of Bacteria or allied organisms ob-
served. The perusal of the discussion just referred to
caused the author to turn again to muscle, liver, and
kidney, with a view of varying and multiplying the evi-
dence. Fowl, pheasant, snipe, partridge, plover, wild duck,
beef, mutton, heart, tongue, lungs,brains, sweetbread, tripe,
the cr) stalline lens, and vitreous humour of an ox, herring,
haddock, mullet, codfish, sole, were all embraced in the
experiments. There was neither mistake nor ambiguity
about the result. One hundred and thirty-nine of the
flasks operated on were exhibited, and not one of this
cloud of witnesses offers the least countenance to the
assertion that liquids within flasks, boiled and her-
metically sealed, swarm, subsequently, more or less
plentifully with Bacieria and allied organisms.

thousand positions have already been collected—forty thousand
for right ascensions and thirty thousand for declinations. Two-
thirds of these observations are published, the rest is calculated,

permit. For fifty years a series of observations have been carried

A Commission appointed in 1874 to report on the Observatory

conclusions are as follows :—To complete the magnetic system
of the Observatory by the acquisition of self-registering instru-
ments, to Organise the International Meteorological Service, to
obtain an equatorial of large dimensions with the accessories
necessary to the spectroscopic investigation of the heavens, and to
increase the number and improve the position of the observer.
The Ministry have, unfortunately, not yet come to a decision on
these conclusions, though we hope they may do so soon, and
enable the valuable work of the Observatory to be carried on
with complete efficiency, and the results be regularly given to

is being regularly carried on on the old lines.
The new Aquarium at Westminster was opened on Saturday
last by the Duke of Edinburgh; but though the building is
sufficiently complete for concerts to be held, it will be many
weeks before the tanks are in a proper condition to receive water.
The arrangements connected with the aquarium proper have been
under the direction of Mr. W. A. Lloyd, who phnned the Crystal
Palace and o'.her aquaria. There are in this latest development
of aquarium construction two or three new points worthy of
attention. The water in flowing from one tank to another will
overflow from one and pass down a tube, so that it enters the next
at the bottom, by which means a more thorough mixture than has
hitherto been attained will be ensured of the wa'er that has been
exposed to the surface aeration. The reservoir which occupies
the space under Jhe large hall is divided into nine compartments,
so that in case of an accident to any part, it can be cleared of
Ihe water and repaired while the other sections remain in opera-
tion. The total capacity of the reservoir is 600,000 gallons, and
the total amount of water in reservoir and tanks together will be
750,000 gallons. For the circulation eight rotary vulcanite
pumps are erected, and they are capable of sending 56,000
gallons an hour through the tanks if needed, to meet any
emergency, though it is calculated that 15,000 to 20,000 gallons
will be about the average amount. The plan of forcing down-

wards small jets of water into each tank, as at the Crystal
Palace, is adopted. In the anemone tanks the water will be
periodically emptied, representing, to some extent, tidal action.
The salmon will have a fifty-feet run, and so will the wrasse. All
the pipes, culverts, &c, are of vulcanite, but the glass fronts of the
tanks are fitted in cork, with the exception of some of the lime-
stone rock-work, which may probably be too soluble; everything
that forethought could arrange in accordance with our present
knowledge seems to have been attended to. It is to be hoped
that the scientific results obtained will not be out of proportion
to the cost of the undertaking. The official guide-book pub-
lished on Saturday contains a useful article on aquarium manage-
ment by Mr. Lloyd, and the Gardeners' Magazine of last week
has also a contribution from his pen on the rise and progress
of aquaria in England; the Morning Post of Saturday last con-
tained an interesting article. The cover of the official guide-
book is ornamented with a wcodcut by Tenniel, which is quite

The mean height of the Seine during 1875 was 2s feet, the
maximum height 10J feet on Jan. 28, and the minimum \ foot

comb out the moisture from the westerly winds; hence the
extensive glaciers of the mountain region and the comparative
dryness of the Canterbury Plains. Mount Cook has an elevation
of 14,000 feet ; this is the principal snow area of the Southern
Alps, and here the island is narrowest. In shape this snow-
field is less compact than that of the Bernese Oberland and
of the Mount Blanc region; their respective areas are: snow-
field of Mount Cook, 160 square miles; Bernese Oberland, 140
square miles; Mount Blanc, 75 square miles. The crystalline
mountains of the south-west do not contain nearly so much snow.
The Tasman glacier is 18 miles long, and 2 miles wide at its
terminal face; the terminal face of the Godley glacier is 3 miles
across. The author then gave a description of the leading
features of the glacier scenery, illustrated by very effective pic-
tures; one of Milford Haven, with the half-snowed peaks of
Mount Pembroke and its neighbours rising to a height of more
than 5,000 feet, was very striking; he also demonstrated the
erosive action of glaciers in cutting back cols—an action more
energetic formerly, some of the cols having been worn down as
low as i.Soo feet. The author pointed out on a map, specially
constructed for the purpose, the immense extent of the snow

area in former times as contrasted with that now existing. This
is proved by the abundance of moraine matter. At present the
ghciers on the west side of the Southern Alps are remarkably
clean (as was well shown by a splendid series of sketches in
colour by the Hon. Mr. Fox and lent for exhibition to the meet-
ing), whilst those on the east side arc largely charged with
detritus. Following a given section in this direction away from
the central ridges we find generally a rock basin, and still lower
immense moraines extending to the Canterbury Plains, till they
fass under the deposits of these plains, which are referred to
liocene and Post-tertiary age. In further illustration of the
former extent of the snow-fields, the author indicated old centres
of glaciers in the north of the island. The reason for this con-
traction of the ice area is the great question for determination.
Was it due to difference of climate the result of a great glacial
period? The remains of the past fauna afford no evidence of
this. We may, indeed, suppose that the whole fauna migrated
to the north, but we must in that case invent the land and bring
into play oscillations more extensive than those required for
another alternative, viz., the alteration of level within the area
itself. We might suppose a general alteration of level, even to
the extent of 4,000 feet higher than at present, but the evidence
afforded by the shore line is unfavourable to this view. There
remains then the theory of unequal elevation, which, combined
with a most enormous destruction of surface, the result of ages

of glacier action, best explains the phenomenon. There can be
no doubt that at present '.he south-west portion of the island,
where the crystalline rocks prevail, is very much depressed in
comparison with its position at some former period; the extra-
ordinary depth of the sub-marine valleys proves this. The author
was inclined to believe in a period of irregular elevation, the
south-west portion having been elevated first, though possibly
the Nelson region at a still earlier date. In conclusion, the author
stated his belief that there had been no general change of climate,
but many changes of relative level, resulting in a great destruction
of surface, which had taken place in groups of peaks at different
times; the areas of the crystalline rocks have been least affected
in their relative changes of level, the oscillation having been
greater in the other masses, which have been crumpled up
against these.

THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND

EXAMINATIONS, like fire and many other useful

but very tyrannous masters. It is excellent that knowledge
should be tested; that men—and shall we say women—
shall be found out for their souls' good if they innocently
deceive themselves as to their acquirements, for the sake
of the community if they assume knowledge they really
do not possess. Unfortunately, what was once a means
bids fair to become an end ; and it is quite certain that
a great deal of knowledge is acquired nowadays which
finds its only use within the walls of the examination
room. It is perhaps a law of human nature that those
who have bitterly endured the harrow—not to suggest
metaphorically another implement—are ever afterwards
eager that all mankind should endure the same process
with no feature of its asperity mitigated. In the Report
of the Sub-committee of the Annual Committee of the
Convocation of the University of London on the Exami-
nation and Inspection of Schools, this feeling makes itself

curiously apparent:—
"The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge having
for many years held local examinations, and having
recently initiated a joint scheme, in accordance with
which they have examined a progressively increasing
number of schools, your Sub-committee fear, that unless
this University is prepared to undertake a share in this
great work, many schools, which have hitherto acted as
feeders to this University, will grow into organic relation
with the older Universities, and that, consequently, the
number of candidates for the London examinations will
sensibly decrease"
The two ancient Universities having, it will be seen,
started a system which has affected, most beneficially,
the middle-class education of the country, and this
system having worked successfully for many years, are
now practically extending it to the higher grade schools.
The Annual Committee have not a word to say as to the
efficiency of the work, although, as we have frequently
said in these columns, much is to be objected as to the
position given to science in it. It might, then, be con-
ceived, that there was no need for the modern Univer-
sity to do more than to wish the older ones God-speed.
But no; there is no salvation in Oxford and little in
Cambridge, and that students should from their youth

with all its sternest features unmitigated by the prestige

people were dimly suspecting the beginning of the
end of the Liberal administration, Mr.Lowe, addressing his

ease with which the molecular transfer is effected in elec-

ing over a pulley is moved: "When the two sides are
equal each link on one side may be conceived as keeping
in equilibrium the opposite link on the other side. A slight
force pulling one side down will bring each link opposite
to a different one" (p. 137). Incidentally, one or two of
the new things strike us as open to question : for instance,

and quite characteristic of the author.

The following extracts will illustrate the remarks we
have made, and afford our readers an idea of the experi-
mental portion of this treatise. Here is an experiment of
the author's which is of considerable interest, whatever
explanation may be accepted :—
"When at a bright white heat, an iron ball refuses to
receive, or at least to retain, even for a moment, a charge
of either -f or — electricity. On cooling down, but while
still of a red heat, it acquires the power of receiving
but not a-f charge; and this distinction is mainl
through a considerable range of temperature. At a lower
temperature yet, but still at a dull red heat, the ball begins
to be able to receive -f electricity, and shortly after, as it
cools, it accepts both kinds with nearly equal readiness.
. . . Again, if we take two equally-charged gold-leaf elec-
troscopes (Fig. 1), one charged with -f and the other with
- electricity, and if we bring earth-connected white-hot
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
iron balls a few inches above the caps of each, they will
be discharged with nearly the same facility. On repeating
the experiment continually, as the balls cool, it is found
that a, or the -fly charged electroscope, ceases to be dis-
charged, though the ball is of a red heat, while B, or the
- electroscope, continues to be immediately discharged,
although the ball has lost all inc andescence."
The explanation of this phenomenon Dr. Guthrie takes
to be as follows :—" If we conceive the air-bathed and
electrically air-straining masses of iron, A and B, to be
respectively -fly and -ly electrified, and then to be gra-

dually heated, the air which we have already partly seen
to have a greater attachment to -f than to - electricity
will, supposing the attachment between the metal and
both kinds to be equally diminished, succeed first, in the
molecular turmoil at the heated surface, in carrying away
the + " (p. 81). Hence the apparently opposite effect seen
in Fig. 1 is due to the inductive action of the charged elec-
troscope upon the earth-connected ball over-head, so that

Fig. 3 shows an ingenious torsion galvanometer, de-
vised, we believe, by the author, and which is stated
to be free from many sources of error.
An ingenious contrivance, due to the author, is shown
in Fig. 4. This is a so-called voltastat, an arrangement
whereby the current interposes "by its own greater or
less action a greater or less resistance in its own circuit,"
and thus the voltastat or automatic rheostat behaves like
the governor of a steam-engine. There are of course
several obvious disadvantages in the use of such an
instrument, but we cannot recall any other continuous
self-acting "voltastat." Helmholtz, in order to keep the
disc of his siren rotating at a constant rate, employed
an electro-magnetic arrangement with attached governor,
but here the current was interrupted when it exceeded
a certain strength.
In the electro-chemical portion of this treatise students
will find much information concerning the reactions
within various forms of batteries and in the electrolysis
of salts, and some interesting facts on electric osmose.
The explanation Dr. Guthrie gives of the prevention
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of "local action" by amalgamation of the zinc is new
to us. The chief cause of local action—which the
author describes as "a coasting trade "—is attributed to
difference of hardness rather than metallic impurities on
the surface of the zinc; mercury, it is asserted, removes
this inequality of hardness due to irregular cooling, " for
as the mercury penetrates, the mass softens and mole-
cular strains are relieved, and uniformity results" (p. 141).
And here we would note one or two minor experimental
statements in the book which we think it would be an
advantage to modify, as readers might unintentionally be
misled. In speaking of the electrolysis of water the
author states that in the first portions of the gas collected
the hydrogen is less than its theoretical proportion.
"This is due to the 'occlusion ' of hydrogen by platinum
under these circumstances. The hydrogen is absorbed
by the platinum. Very soon, however, the metal becomes
saturated, and the exact combining ratio is observed '•
(p. 157). This effect, we imagine, must very promptly
be masked by a contrary action—to which Dr. Guthrie
does not allude—for, except under special circumstances,
the amount of oxygen is perceptibly deficient in electro-
lysis, and, as is well known, is due to the formation of
ozone. And is not the following electro-chemical state-
ment also open to comment?—"Hydrogen, when freshly
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
liberated, has, as is well known, an exceedingly power-
ful reducing action. Use is made of this circum-
stance to protect the copper sheathing of ships
the evolution of hydrogen . on the copper surface de-
oxidises any oxidised portion" (p. 128). A student
might from this be led to infer that the electro-negative
metal in a cell would not be protected unless hydrogen
were evolved on its surface. Again, in describing the
evolution of electricity by an ordinary electric machine,
it is merely stated that "the + electricity enters the
prime conductor, and — leaves it ; the prime conductor
thus becomes +" (p. 52). A reference to the inductive
action exerted on the prime conductor, the high tension
at the points, and therefrom the discharge of the induced
opposite electricity on to the machine, seems needed
here.
We must now devote a few words to one feature
wherein the present text-book differs from most of the
ordinary manuals on electricity. Dr. Guthrie has sought
to give the reader some acquaintance with terms and
methods of measurement which in general are better

simple matters become invested with an air of great diffi-
culty. Thus, to take one other example, we should have
thought it needless to devote so much space to the
difference between a right and left-handed spiral, as is
given on p. 24.2, et sea.
There are also several clerical errors and misprints
throughout the book, which we regret we have not space
to point out, as they ought to be corrected in a new edi-
tion; some of the woodcuts, moreover, need alteration.
In conclusion, we must remark that, although a careful
perusal of this work has led us to notice several things
which ought to have been different, yet we are not in-
sensible to the good features of this unpretending text-
book, and we hope, therefore, that Dr. Guthrie will have
a speedy opportunity of removing the blemishes which
seriously mar the usefulness of his book. In the stric-
tures we have ventured to offer we trust nothing offensive
to the author has appeared, for whom we entertain, and

THE number of works of travel published within the
last few months is probably unprecedented. Scarcely
a week has passed during that time in which we have not
had occasion to notice one or more in these columns.
One noteworthy feature about these narratives of travel
is that few of them are by what may be called professional
explorers, men who have led expeditions into unknown or
little known lands and seas for the sole purpose of ex-
tending our knowledge of them. They are mostly written
by men who, solely from a love of adventure and sport,
have left all the comforts and luxuries which wealth and
a high social position can bring to undergo many of the
hardships and privations which fall to the lot of those
who have adopted discovery as their work in life. No
doubt improvements in modes of travel, and especially in
steam navigation, have something to do with this, as has
also the tedium which occasionally comes upon every

intelligent man who has to plod the weary round of the
duties, and especially the pleasures, of civilised life. But,
as we said last week, we are inclined to attribute this
growing love of travel, of amateur exploration, in some
degree to the general advance of intelligence urging those
who can afford it to gratify their craving for knowledge
by stronger stimulants than can be obtained from books.
Possibly also some may think this growing love of travel
in wild regions, mingled as it often is with intense delight
in dangerous sport, is to some extent a breaking out of
remote ancestral habit, of a habit which still clings to us
from a time when our ancestors, like existing savages,
were explorers and hunters of the wildest animals for
dear life—a habit which only requires a favourable oppor-
tunity to be re-developed, though with a different aim.
Whatever may be the causes, there can be no doubt
about the fact of the rapidly-growing love of adventure
and discovery, involving dangers and hardships of a very
real kind. No better examples could be found than those
of the authors of the two works before us.

NATURE
A good map of the territories around the Yellowstone
region, and a large scale-map of the Upper and Lower
Geyser Basins, enable the reader to follow the author in
his wanderings and descriptions.
From a scientific point of view Mr. Lamont's book is
more valuable than the one we have been speaking about.
So long ago as 1858-59, Mr. Lamont made voyages,
mainly for sport, to the Spitzbergen Arctic region; and
in 1869-70-71 he made other three voyages. In the
volume before us he has brought together some of the
most valuable results of his observations during these
voyages, and while devoting considerable space to his
sporting adventures with the walrus, the seal, and the
bear, he gives much information of scientific value. His
sporting skill stood him in good stead, as from his large
takes of walruses, seals, and bears, not to mention rein-
deer and smaller game, he must have been, in 1869 at
least, considerably recouped for the expenses of his
voyage.
Mr. Lamont, very naturally judging from his own suc-
cess, is inclined to place more value on private Arctic

enterprises than on elaborately equipped Government
exploring expeditions. He refers to the expedition in the
Polaris, commanded by a civilian, and which got further
north than any ship had previously done. But we think
that any one who reads the narrative of that unfortunate
expedition unprejudicedly, must conclude that had the
expedition been under strict naval discipline it would
have reached a point still further north, would have ac-
complished more in the way of scientific observation than
it did, and would not have ended with the disaster
that befell it The last Payer-Weyprecht expedition,
though not a Government one, was practically under
naval discipline, and the English Government expeditions
referred to by Mr. Lamont, did not fail in their endea-
vours to push northwards because they were such. But
Mr. Lamont speaks as if the main object of Arctic explo-
ration were to get as far north as possible, whereas, in the
eyes of scientific men, this is a point of minor importance;
and they maintain rightly, we think, and their opinion is
supported by past experience, that no Arctic expedition
can be adequately equipped to collect all the scientific
data which can be so abundantly obtained in these
regions, unless it be sent out by Government and be
conducted with all the method and strictness which naval
discipline alone can enforce. Private enterprises like

those of Mr. Lamont and the whale fishers, can do much
to add to our knowledge of the Arctic regions, but if we
had had to depend entirely on such means, what would
have been the amount and value of our knowledge at the
present day?
Mr. Lamont gives a minute description of the con.
struction of his admirably built steam yacht the Diana,
which came unscathed through many dangers. In 1869
he sailed as far as the Kara Straits, which he did not
enter. Next year, however, he passed through Pet or
Jugor Straits, and penetrated a short distance into the
Kara Sea, coming out by the Kara Straits. He sailed up
the west side of Novaya Zemlya as far as Admiralty
Peninsula, and after several trials succeeded in passing
through the Matoschkin Schar. He landed on several
points of the island, and gives some valuable notes
on the fauna and flora which he observed. In 1869
he sailed along the edge of the ice-pack a little north
of the 75th degree of latitude, to Spitzbergen, the coasts
and gulfs and islands of which in his various voyages
he has examined with great minuteness, and contributes

(Paris, 1875.)
THE four names of Watt, Fulton, Stephenson, and Denis
Papin, inscribed on the roof of the railway station at Blois,
suggest a train of thought to the author in connection
with the triumphs of steam and its applications. Having
previously described the Chateau de Blois, the writer
puts forward a proposal (sometimes he calls it a dream)
to turn the now abandoned chateau into a noble valhalla
of science. A principal feature is a statue of Papin (born
at Blois about 1650); there should be also statues of
other scientific writers of all time and climes, appropriate
inscriptions, portraits on the walls, and representations of
interesting scenes in the history of science, chambers
for the exhibition of models and instruments, a sci-
entific library, and other matte s. So his dream is to

make this a Versailles of science. A classification of the
sciences and a plan close this part of the pamphlet.
We do not, however, concern ourselves here with this
proposal or dream or whatnot, but pass on to a brief
glance at the three appendices. The first is " Definit on
de la double-tendance Philosophique de la Science/'
Noting the objects the "immortal" l.acon had in view in
his New Atlantis, he applies himself to the consideration
of what is the classification that we can make of the
sciences, and combats Auguste Comte's arrangement
according to the increasing complexity which appears
inherent in them. In our author's eyes ail sciences have
the same complex character (caractere de complication)
either virtually or actually. Comte begins witli mathe-
matics, Hugo exalts them to a high place: "L'inte'ret
philosophique des sciences mathe'matiques est de marcher
a la rencontre des sciences naturelles. II n'y a rien la qui
ressemble a une subordination des certaines sciences"
The second is "Examen gdome'triquesommaire des orbites
plandtaires(ovhdlites)." The writer remarks that recent dis-
coveries in Astronomy have pointed to a new movement
of the solar system in space, hence the orbit or trajectory
of our planets is not a plane curve. This orbit is ahelicoidal
curve with an elliptical or oval projection. Hence ov-hdl- ite.
In the geometrical description of such a curve we must
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
indicate whether the trace is dcxlrorsum or sinistrorsum.
The ovhdlites of the planets and of the earth are geo-
metrically traced stnistrorsum. In this paper, which was
originally communicated to the Mathematical Society of
Paris, the author states the theoiem "Les ovhdlites plnnd-
tairessont tracers sur les cylindres a section droite eliip
tique (sauf perturbation) ou du mo;ns ovalaire. Une des
lignes focales des susdites ovhelites est commune; cette

the Count speak for himself, "Jc propose aujourd'hui

the general public will be perfectly lop,ical in concluding that
either the public analysts are generally incompetent, or that
chemical analysis is self-contradictory, and therefore worthless.
The subject is one that seriously affects the dignity and general
interests of science.
Much of the blundering that has unquestionably occurred is
doubtless due to the peculiar position of public analysts and the
impossibilities they are called upon to perform. The political
economist tells us that "demand for commodities induces a cor-
responding supply," and the Adulteration Act was evidently
framed upon the assumption that analytical skill is a "com-
modity" subject to this law, as it demanded the immediate crea-
tion of a whole army of chemists endowed with a peculiar kind
of knowledge and skill, which was not to be acquired in any
college, school, university, or other educational institution,
public or private, in Great Britain. Laboratories existed wherein
the analyses of acids, bases, and salts, organic and inorganic,
were carefully taught, and others where special attention was
devoted to pharmaceutical preparations; but where (before the
parsing of this Act) could a student find a laboratory in which
he might learn how to analyse the multitude of articles that pass

over a grocer's counter, and acquire the commercial knowledge
which is as necessary to the public analyst as analytical skill?
I use the past tense here, knowing that since the passing of the
Act many public analysts have industriously and meritoriously
availed themselves of the opportunities afforded at one laboratory
that has been specially devoted to the useful purpose of affording
them the special analytical skill they should have possessed be-
fore obtaining their appointments. Then: do.not, however, appear
to be any sufficient means provided for the commercial and tech-
nological education of public analysts.
As an example of the necessity of commercial or technical
knowledge, I need only refer to the discoveries of " iron filings"
in tea which were so common until 1 ately, the absurdity of
which I have already demonstrated by simply calculating the
number of tons of iron filings that would be annually required for
the alleged adulteration, and showing the practical impossibility
of obtaining such a supply, either lure or in China. Iron was
found in the tea unquestionably,—the chemistry was not at
fault,—but the theory which confounded accidental impurity
wi'.h wilful adulteration arose from lack of technical knowledge,
tbe possession of which would have shown that leaves carelessly
gathered and thrown upon the dusty ground of a highly ferru-
ginous soil, and then roasted, must ol necessity be mingled with
more or less of magnetic oxide of iron, besides the iron natur-
ally contained in the ashes of this particular plant

The series of butter cases, of which the one you quote is only
a recent and ordinary example, illustrate the same want of
trade knowledge on the part of nearly all concerned. I have
been surprised at the repeated and uncontradicted assumption
that butter must be adulterated because it is cheap, which has
run througli all these cases. We all know that good butter at
this season is not obtainable at less than |u. &/. per lb.,
and much is sold at 2-r., and therefore it is inferred that if butter
ts offered for sale at ia/. or is. it must be adulterated. This
is a very plausible inference, but nevertheless a great mistake,
which public analysts and siitinj; magistrates have evidently
shared with the general public. l>at lor irritating old sorej, I
might quote from early prosecutions, and show how an inspector
and public analjst have evidently been so biassed and deceived by
the simple fact that butter was offered for sale at 8</. per lb., and
that the analyst interpreted equivocal analytical results according
to such preconceptions. Had he known that parcels of genuine
butter, sometimes amounting to several tons, are occasionally
offered as low as yJ. per lb. in wholesale markets, this erro-
neous preconception would not have been formed. 1 have eaten

central line. Using the Nautical Almanac elements,

at an altitude of 5° at 6h. 16m. am. on the 18th local
time. Thence skirting Ellice Islands it passes between
the Fiji's and the Samoan or Navigator group to Savage
Island, in 170° west of Greenwich, latitude 19° south,
which is apparently the only spot where totality may be
witnessed under anything like favourable conditions, and
even here the duration of totality is less than one minute.
The after course of the central line does not encounter
any land.
In the northern of the two large islands of the Fiji
group (Vanua Levu) 1790 east, a partial eclipse will occur
commencing at 7h. 47m. a.m. local time 440 from the
sun's north point towards the west for direct image, and
ending at ioh. 16m., magnitude o-86. In the larger
island of the Navigator group, Savaii, of the Admiralty
Chart, there will also be a partial eclipse, though nearly
approaching totality ; eclipse begins 8h. 23m. a.m. at 530
from the sun's north point towards the west, and ends at
1 ih. 2m., magnitude 0*97.
Assuming the north point of Savage Island to be in

point towards west for direct image, and the end of the
eclipse at 1 ih. 29m.
In New Zealand the eclipse attains a magnitude of
about 0*5 at Auckland, greatest phase at 9h. iSm. a.m.;
towards the extremity of the southern island about Otago,
one-third of the sun's diameter will be obscured about

limits will be visible on the east coast of Australia* and in

his experiments were conducted. But he did find cases
of fertilisation after prolonged exposure to the boiling
temperature; and this caused him to come to the con-
clusion that under certain rare conditions spontaneous
generation may occur. He also found that an alkalised
hay-infusion was so difficult to sterilise that it was capable
of withstanding the boiling temperature for hours without
losing its power of generating life. The most careful ex-
periments have been made with this infusion. Dr.
Roberts is certainly correct in assigning to it superior
nutritive power. But in the present inquiry five minutes
boiling sufficed to completely sterilise the infusion.
Summing up this portion of his inquiry, the author
remarks that he will hardly be charged with any desire to
limit the power and potency of matter. But holding the
notions he does upon this point, it is all the more incum-
bent on him to affirm that as far as inquiry has hitherto
penetrated, life has never been proved to appear inde-
pendently of antecedent life.

of infusions, every one of which became charged with
organisms. To obte.in more definite insight regarding
the diffusion of atmospheric germs, a square wooden tray
was pierced with 100 holes, into each of which was dropped
a short test-tube. On Oct 23, thirty of these tubes were
filled with an infusion of hay, thirty-five with an infusion
of turnip, and thirty-five with an infusion of beef. The
tubes, with their infusions, had been previously boiled,
ten at a time, in an oil-bath. One hundred circles were
marked on paper so as to form a map of the tray, and
every day the state of each tube was registered upon the
corresponding circle. In the following description the
term "cloudy" is used to denote the first stage of tur-
bidity; distinct but not strong. The term "muddy" is
used to denote thick turbidity.
One tube of the 100 was first singled out and rendered
muddy. It belonged to the beef group, and it was a
whole day in advance of all the other tubes. The pro-

gress of putrefaction was first registered on Oct. 26 ; the
"map" then taken may be thus described :—
Hay.—Of the thirty specimens exposed one had be-
come " muddy"—the seventh in the middle row reckon-
ing from the side of the tray nearest the stove. Six tubes
remained perfectly clear between this muddy one and the
stove, proving that differences of warmth may be over-
ridden by other causes. Every one of the other tubes
containing the hay infusion showed spots of mould upon
the clear liquid.
Turnip.—Four of the thirty-five tubes were very
muddy, two of them being in the row next the stove, one
four rows distant, and the remaining one seven rows
away. Besides these six tubes had become clouded.
There was no mould on any of the tubes.
Beef.—One tube of the thirty-five was quite muddy, in
the seventh row from the stove. There were three cloudy
tubes, while seven of them bore spots of mould.
As a general rule organic infusions exposed to the air
during the autumn remained for two days or more per-
fectly clear. Doubtless from the first germs fell into

ten nearest the stove had given way to putrefaction.
Three of the rows most distant from the stove had yielded,
while here and there over the tray particular tubes were
singled out and smitten by the infection. Of the whole
tray of one hundred tubes, twenty-seven were either
muddy or cloudy on the 1 ith. Thus, doubtless, in a con-
tagious atmosphere, are individuals successively struck
down. On the 12th all the tubes had given way, but the
differences in their contents were extraordinary. All of
them contained Bacteria, some few, others in swarms.
In some tubes they were slow and sickly in their motions,
in some apparently dead, while in others they darted
about with rampant vigour. These differences are to
be referred to changes in the germinal matter, for the
same infusion was presented everywhere to the air. Here
also we have a picture of what occurs during an epidemic,
the difference in number and energy of the Bacterial
swarms resembling the varying intensity of the disease.
It becomes obvious from these experiments that of two
individuals of the same population, exposed to a con-
tagious atmosphere, the one may be severely, the other

lightly attacked, though the two individuals may be as
identical as regards susceptibility as two samples of one
and the same mutton infusion.
The author traces still further the parallelism of these
actions with the progress of infectious disease. The
Times of January 17 contained a remarkable letter on
Typhoid Fever signed "M.D.," in which occurs the fol-
lowing remarkable statement:—" In one part of it (Edin-
burgh), congregated together and inhabited by the lowest
of the population, there are, according to the Corporation
return for 1874, no less than 14,319 houses or dwellings-
many under one roof, on the 'flat' system—in which
there are no house connections whatever with the street
sewers, and, consequently, no water-closets. To this
day, therefore, all the excrementitious and other refuse of
the inhabitants is collected in pails or pans, and remains
in their midst, generally in a partitioned-off corner of the
living room, until the next day, when it is taken down to
the streets and emptied into the Corporation carts.
Drunken and vicious though the population be, herded
together like sheep, and with the filth collected and kept
for twenty-four hours in their very midst, it is a remark-
able fact that typhoid fever and diphtheria are simply
unknown in these wretched hovels."
This case has its analogue in the following experiment,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which is representative of a class. On Nov. 30 a quantity
of animal refuse, embracing beef, fish, rabbit, hare, was
placed in two large test-tubes opening into a protecting
chamber containing six tubes. On Dec. 13, when the
refuse was in a state of noisome putrefaction, infusions of
whiting, turnip, beef, and mutton were placed in the other
four tubes. They were boiled and abandoned to the
action of the foul "sewer gas" emitted by their two
putrid companions. On Christmas-day the four infusions
were limpid. The end of the pipette was then dipped
into one of the putrid tubes, and a quantity of matter
comparable in smallness to the pock-lymph held on the
point of a lancet was transferred to the turnip. Its clear-
ness was not sensibly affected at the time; but on the
26th it was turbid throughout. On the 27th a speck from
the infected turnip was transferred to the whiting; on the
28th disease had taken entire possession of the whiting.
To the present hour the beef and mutton tubes remain as
limpid as distilled water. Just as in the case of the living
men and women in Edinburgh, no amount of fetid gas

the fractured end, so as to give it a bevelled edge ; but
the specimens here figured cannot be classed with these,
inasmuch as there is nothing suggestive of the arrow-
point in their present shape, and unlike them, these four
specimens have the under side smooth and slightly con-
cave, a feature not found in the "made over" arrow-
heads.
Having seen that so much care was expended on these
small scrapers, it is quite certain that these implements
were put to some important use, but exactly what, it is diffi-
cult to determine. Certainly, in the dressing of the skins
of our larger mammals they could be of no use, and of
but little even when the skins of the smallest, such as
squirrels, were used, which was probably seldom the case,
as the ^larger quadrupeds were as easily obtained. The
Fie. 3.
skins of birds, if used as ornaments, would not need
scraping to make them pliable; and I can only suggest
that from the fact of having found traces of bone beads,

in graves, made from sections of the long bones of
wading birds, I have thought it probable that these small
scrapers were used in rounding off the ends of such bone
beads; and they might also have been used in the shap-
ing and sharpening of the beautiful bone fish-hooks our
aborigines were accustomed to make. Such uses would,
of course, make the name "skin-scraper" inappropriate,
as I am quite disposed to think it is.
Fig. 5 represents a very perfect specimen of the spoon-
shaped scrapers, such as are common in Europe, and by
no means rare in the United States. Those found here,
as a rule, are not so symmetrical as the specimen figured,
and do not have the "bowl" or concave portion of the
spoon so decidedly marked. Our New Jersey specimens
have this under-surface generally plain, or but slightly
concave; and uniform with the stem or handle of the
implement. In the specimen figured this is not the case,
and the spoon-shape is so pronounced as to suggest that
it is a veritable spoon.

Foreign fat = 55-2 „ „
Butter fat = 237 „ „
The fat was thus made up of 30 per cent, of butter fat
and 70 per cent, foreign fats. The fat had a melting point
below that of butter, and yielded 933 per cent, of fatty
acids. When examined by the microscope the butter was
found to contain fat in a crystalline state, and the so-
called curd consisted of vegetable matter, which was
described as parenchyma. Finally, the butter was stated
to be but slightly rancid.
Dr. Muter said that his standard for genuine butter
was 88 per cent, of fatty acids.
Dr. Muter, who appears to have had sufficient of his
sample to supply several of his friends, was supported in
Court by his assistant Mr. De Konigh, Dr. Dupre, Mr.
Wigner, and a microscopist.

per cent, fixed fatty acids, and the melting-point of
the fat 40 C. below that "of genuine butter. On a
microscopic examination of the butter, both found crys-
tals of fat, which indicated that it had been fused. They
also stated that the butter was practically free from
rancidity.
Dr. Dupre" was of opinion, from the results of his
analysis, that there was a doubt whether the sample con-
tained any butter at all; and Mr. Wigner considered that
if it contained any butter-fat the quantity must be small,
but indeed he thought it was foreign fat simply flavoured
with caproic acid. He further stated that his standard
for pure butter was 87*5 per cent, fatty acids.
Somerset House Results.—The portion of the sample
retained by the inspector, and referred by the magistrate
to Somerset House for analysis, weighed about 45
grammes, and it was stated that the experiments per-
formed were not only of an exhaustive character, but
were repeated in most instances.
The chemists there found as follows :—

Fat = 83-54 „
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
The fat gave a melting point of 33'3° C, a density of
¦9053 at ioo0 Fahr., and yielded 887 per cent, fatty acids,
the latter being seven-tenths above Dr. Muter's standard.
The butter was found to be very rancid, and this
rancidity would account for the slight excess of fixed fatty
acids, it having been found by actual experiment that
butter depreciates by exposure, and that there is a cor-
responding increase of the fixed fatty acids found in the fat.
On a microscopic examination the butter was found
to be free from crystals of fat, and the only foreign sub-
stances present were a few particles of impurities con-
sisting of hard wood and cotton thread.
The following are the results of the analysis of the fat
of an article corresponding to "butterine," which was
referred to in Court as having been examined in exactly
a similar way as the sample in dispute :—
Fatty acids, 9332 per cent., melting-point, 250 C, and
density of fat at ioo0 F. = "90108.

of obsidian. The spot where the remains were discovered was
at one time covered with vegetation, but this having been burned
by bush fires the ground had been covered by drifting sand, the
disturbance of which by the wind has exposed the bones. The
natives in the district had no knowledge whatever of the exist-

to be considerable. Further researches in the same locality may
possibly be productive of interesting results.

NATURE
PROF. NORDENSKJOLD ON THE JENISEI
T N a letter from Prof. Nordenskjold, of Stockholm, to Mr.
¦*• Oscar Dickson, Prof. Nordenskjold gives the following
further details of his expedition.
In my preceding letters I narrated the progress of the Novaya
Zemlya Jenisei Expedition up to the time when we, after a boat
voyage of fifty to sixty Swedish miles, at Saostrowskoj on Aug.
31, fell in with the steamer Alexander, in which we afterwards
journeyed 150 Swedish miles further up the Jenisei during a
whole month to the town of Jeniseisk.
I proceed now to finish the account of my journey, with a short
sketch of this steam voyage.
The Alexander was neither a passenger nor a cargo sleamer,
bit formed a moveable warehouse propelled by steam, which was
commanded not by seamen but by a friendly and afTable merchant,
who clearly did not much concern himself with the navigation
of the vessel, but rather with trade and goods, and was seldom
by the crew called "captain " but generally "hosain" (master).
The arrangement of the vessel itself corresponded to this state
of things. The whole of the fore-saloon was fitted up as a shop
with shelves for goods along the walls, the usual desk, &c. The
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
after-saloon was employed as a counting-house, writing and
.sleeping apartment for the master, and was besides filled to over-
flowing with wares of various kinds for sale, spirit casks, &c.
There was thus no room for passengers, and at the first when we
lay-to with the Swedish flag hoisted, our "hosain," Herr Ivan
Michailovitsch Jarmenieff's reception of us was by no means
specially friendly. He was even indisposed in the beginning to
take u« along with him. But no sooner had I, with the help of
our pilot Teodor and a Swedish-Russian lexicon, succeeded in
explaining to him what sort of people we were and what journey
we had made, than all was completely changed, and from that
moment we had in our " hosain" the most agreeable and obliging
host we could desire. In order to make room for us on board,
a cabin before the wheel-house, which had been filled with goods,
was emptied and arranged for passengers. Its size was by no
means great. During the night, for instance, we could only with
difficulty lie alongside each other on abedstead formed of boards,
whicli took up neatly the who'e cabin. Our men at first got
places wlierever thev could, in the engine-room, where they were
kindly entertained by the engineer. Alterwards we obtained
another more roomy cabin, and our men got that which we had
in the beginning.
The navigation of the vessel was managed by two mates, of a
stately and original appearance, who, clothed in long caftans,
each during his watch sr.t on a chair at the wheel, generally
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
without steering, for the most part smoking a "papiross," and
with the most unconcerned expression in the world exchang-
ing jokes with those who were walking below. A man stood
constantly in the foie part of the vessel, unceasingly trying the
depth of the water with a long pole. In order to avoid
the strong current of the deep central stream the course
was taken not in the deepest part of the river, but as near the
bank as possible, often so near that we could almost jump to land,
and that our Nordland boat, which was towed alongside the
steamer, was often drawn over land. The Alexander besides
bad in tow first one, afterwards two vessels (lodjor), nearly of
the same size as the steamer itself, intended to receive the fish
bought during the voyage, which was generally salted and pre-
pared on board. The whole way between Jeniseisk and the
sea there is not a single jetty, and on this account both the
steamer and the two lodjor towed in addition a number of larger
or smaller barges and boats intended for communication with the
land. Siberia,* and especially the river territory of Jenisei, possesses
rich coal beds, which probably extend under a great pait of the
Siberian plain, but as yet are not worked, and attract little atten-
tion. Like all the other steamers on the Siberian rivers, accord-

mats of furs. The bed consisted of a couch near the roof, so
extensive that it occupied a third or a half of the room, and so
far from the floor that a man could go under it upright. Food
was prepared in large baking ovens, which were daily fired for
this purpose, and warmed the hut at the same time. New bread
was to be had every day; and even for the poor a large brass
tea um was a necessary household article. We were always
sure of meeting with a hearty and friendly reception wherever we
stepped over the threshold, and if we stayed a short time we had
generally to drink a glass of tea with our hosts whatever time of
the day it might be. The dress everywhere somewhat resembled
the common Russian; for the better classes for instance wide
velvet trousers stuck into the boots, a shirt grandly embroidered
with silver, and a wide caftan often trimmed with fur; for the
poor, in case he was not too ragged, the same cut, but inferior,
dirty, and torn material. During the winter, however, the
Samoyede fur dress is worn out of doors both by high and low,
by Russian and native, by settled and nomad.
For the present there were in these regions only very few
persons who had been banished hither for political reasons, but
on the contrary many exiled criminals, and among them also

some few Finns, and even a Swede, or at least one who accord-
ing to his own statement in broken S wedish had formerly served
in the King's body-guard in Stockholm. Security for person
and property was in all cases complete, and it was* remarkable
that there was no true difference of caste that could be observed
between the Russian-Siberian natives and those who had been
banished to those regions for crimes. Little interest even ap-
peared to be taken in knowing the crimes which had caused the
banishment. An inquiry on this point was generally met by the
sufficiently elastic reply " for bad conduct"
I mentioned above that mammoth teeth here form an impor-
tant arlicle of commerce. They are also belived to occur in
large quantity on the tundra, though the difficulty of communi-
cations often renders their removal impossible. Although this
is the mammoth region proper, the larger parts of the skeleton
are believed to be very rare, and still more mammoth with flesh,
hide and hair still remaining. It was, for instance, on the
peninsula between Obi and Jenisei, that the great mammoth
find by Trofimoff occurred, and in the neighbourhood of the same
place was found the mammoth which gave occasion to Schmitt's
expedition. It is probable, besides, that the nomad native has the
same indisposition to acquaint an official with a large mammoth
find as the peasants at home had in former times, and in certain
regions still have to give information about a supposed vein of
ore.

On Sept. 4 the AlexanJtr weighed anchor, and steamed south-
wards during splendid weather.
The landscape now began by degrees to change its character
completely. In fact, on most maps the limit of wood is drawn
along the considerable bend which the river Jenisei makes
immediately west or north-west of Dudino, and indeed here for the
first time numerous pine trees are met with, but seldom more than
20 feet high. These cover the heights with a sparse and by no
means attractive vegetation, completely destitute of the beautiful
effect which distinguishes the willow and alder bushes farther
north. Already some few miles south of Dudino, however, the
pine forest became tall, though here we are still north of the
Arctic circle. It is here that the forest proper commences—the
largest forest of the globe—stretching with little interruption
across the whole of Siberia, in one direction, from Ural to the
Sea of Ochotsk, and in the other, south of the 58th or 59th
degree of latitude, and north of the Arctic circle, at some places,
for instance at the rivers Chatanga and Lena, beyond it on to
the neighbourhood of 720 N. lat., that is to say, to the mouths of
Chatanga and Lena, ten Swedish miles north of North Cape.

attention was turned to the cultivation of the soil. Round the
huts, accordingly, were patches of land in potatoes, turnips, and
cabbage, which at least this year yielded abundant crops, though
the colony is situated in the latitude of Avasaxa, that is to say,
under the Arctic circle.
Later in the day we came to the Monastery of Troit, in former
limes renowned and rich, now inhabited only by a single monk,
viz., the prior himself. He was a worthy old man, who gave us
a hospitable and friendly reception. The apartment for the
reception of guests was adorned with a number of portraits of
Siberian bishops. There was besides a portrait of a Russian
Czar in powdered hair and military uniform, with blue great
ctoss riband. It was a portrait of Czar Paul, but through some
exchange the Skoptists had taken it into their heads that the
portrait represented their holy prophet, Czar Peter III., whose
history they had completely altered in accordance with their
idealised conception of the world. An educated man, who
belonged to this sect, and on this account had been banished to
North Jenisei, informed me accordingly in all seriousness that
Czar Peter III. was not murdered, but was knouted and sent to
Siberia, &c, all on account of his holiness—as so it happens

the young and old leaves of good plants and of stunted and
blighted plants of different varieties, analyses of the wood of
good and stunted tea-plants of different varieties, analyses of tea-
seed, of the soils of tea-plantations, and of tea from manured
and unmanured plants. The author discusses also the analytical
results.—On certain new reactions of tungsten, by Prof. J. \V.

contrary to the statements in text-books, that the precipitate pro-
duced by hydrochloric acid in a solution of an alkaline tungstate
is soluble in an excess of the concentrated acid. By adding frag-
ments of metallic zinc to the above-named acid solution, various
colours are produced, the most noteworthy being a brilliant
magenta. Potassium sulphocyanate and metallic zinc added to
the acid solution produce a rich green colour, but when the sul-
phocyanate is added first to the alkaline tungstate solution, then a
considerable quantity of water, then hydrochloric acid, and finally

known as characteristic of one of the lower oxides of tungsten
may be best brought out by the use of hyposulpliurous acid
(H.jSO,) as the reducing agent.—The remainder of the journal
contains the usual collection of abstracts.
American Journal of Science and Arts, Dec. 1875.— This
number commences with a paper of careful observations by Prof.
Dana on five of the river valleys of Southern New England,
with a view to ascertaining the depression of that region during
the melting of the glacier. This he estimates at about 15 feet.
1 le considers that the terraces in the Housatonic, Connecticut,
and Thames, which are now so high above the river's surface,
were not wholly, or mostly formed when the land was at a much
lower level then now, but they were formed when the rivers
were at a gTeatly higher level than now, owing chiefly to the
glacial flood. Thus we may have high and numerous terraces
along valleys, and yet none be due to an elevation of the land.
The height of the streams during the flood above high tide level
is estimated in one case at as much as 237 feet (from which the
15 feet depression would be deducted). The amount of depres-
sion increased from the sound northwards at about one foot and

a second. One terminal in the above determinations consisted
of a point of 30°, and the other of a slightly convex surface 0-46
inch in diameter.
While making these measurements, we noticed in a nearly
dark room that when the point was negative a glow, in form like
a paraboloid, was seen surrounding it long beiore the spark
passed, and its appearance afforded by its increasing brilliancy
useful information to guide us as to the more cautious approach
of the terminals; gradually the sugar-loaf-like glow extended to
the positive terminal. With 1,800 cells the glow was seen when
the terminals were 0-0545 mcn apart, the spark passing at
0-0345 inch ; with 2,400 cells the glow began at a distance of
0-0865 inch, the spark passing at 00535 inch. Moreover, it was
noticed that the disc (positive) became covered all over with a
peach-like bloom, which became stronger in the centre as the
terminals were made to approach each other, giving rise to
Newton's iridescent rings.
In order to study more readily the phenomena accompanying
the glow preceding the spark, the whole series of 5>t>40 cells was
used, the terminals being a point as before of 30°, and sometimes
a fiat disc fi inch in diameter, or a slightly convex one of 08
inch in diameter for the other. In all cases a peach-like bloom
deposited on the disc, which was connected with the silver
(p >sitive) terminal; and when the flat disc was used the deposit
was notably greater at the periphery and the centre than in other

portions 01 it. With this number of cells, with the flat disc the
glow occurred at 1 -073 in., the spark at 0*139 in. With the
slightly convex disc occurred at I "124 in., the spark at 0-140 in.*
To ascertain whether a current really passed when the glow
appeared, various vacuum-tubes were interposed in circuit be-
tween the battery and one of the terminals; in all cases they
were illuminated even before a glow was perceptible on the
negative pole; their interposition, as was to be expected,
shortened the spark and diminished the distance at which the
glow was perceptible. For example, with a hydrogen tube,
having a capillary portion between two larger tubes, such as is
used for spectrum experiments, and offering a resistance of
190,000 ohms, the glow occurred at 0939 inch, the spark at
0-092 inch.
A tube of 31 inches between the terminals, and offering a
resistance of 350,000 ohms, was brilliantly illuminated when
interposed between one terminal and the battery; when the
terminals were separated the extreme range of the discharge
was 1 '2 inch, and beiore any glow was visible at the negative
electrode. How much further between the electrodes it will be
possible to obtain a current has yet to be determined with a

assisted by the force of growth and the movement of the

larity of external conditions in the Silurian and present times,
and to the wonderful persistence of form of this low member of

Ramsay, F.R.S. The author described and illustrated by sec-
tions drawn to scale the contours of the island of Anglesey and
the adjacent parts of Carnarvonshire, and noticed that the whole
island may be regarded as a gritly undulating plain, the higher
parts of which attain an average elevation of from 200 to 300 (eet
above the sea-level. Similar conditions are presented by the
countiy for some miles on the other side of the straits, and in
both the general trend of the valleys is north-east and south-
west. The rock surfaces, when bare, show glacial stria: running
generally in a direction 300 to 40° west of south. The author
indicated that the great upheavals of the crust of the e^rth form-
ing mountains took place long before the commencement of the
Glacial epoch, and that ordinary agent* of denudation had ample
time for the formation in mountain regions of deep valleys, down

which, during the Glacial epoch, glaciers would take their course.
He noticed the evidence of this local glaciation furnished by the
striation of the Welsh mountains, from which he inferred that
these mountains as a whole were not overridden by a great ice-
sheet coming from the north, and he described the course of the
glaciers flowing from the north-west slopes of Snowdonia as
being in the directions west, north-west, and north. These
glaciers, however, did not reach the region now occupied by the
Menai Straits, but spread out in broad fans on the north-western
slopes of the hills now overlooking the Straits, a fact indicated
by the directions of the glacial strias in these parts. Anglesey,
therefore, was not glaciated by ice-masses coming from Snow-
donia; and as the striations on that island point directly towards
the mountains of Cumberland, the author inferred that these
markings were produced by a great ice-flow coming from that
region, reinforced probably by ice-streams from the north of
Scotland, and which were large and powerful enough to prevent
the glaciers of Llanberis and Nantffrancon from encroaching on
the territory of Anglesey. The author described the rocks bor-
dering the Straits as consisting of nearly horizontal Carboniferous
strata, which, from appearances, must once have filled the whole
of the region now occupied by the Straits. He considered that
the softer shaly, sandy, and marly beds, remains of some of
which are still to be seen on the coast, were swept away by the
action of the great glacier coming from the north-east, forming a

valley now occupied by the sea ; and in support of this view he
cited the valley of Malldraeth Marsh, running across Anglesey,
parallel to that of the Menai Straits, about four miles to the
north-west, which a very slight change in conditions would con-
vert into a fjord, differing from the Straits only in being closed
at the north-east end.

Ernest Favre took up the discussion which has existed for ten
years among geologists and palaeontologists on the limit of the
Jurassic and Cretaceous beds in the Alps, where the beds are not
separated, as in the Anglo-Parisian basin, by freshwater deposits.
Oppcl, in 1865, gave the name of Tithonic stage to the beds con-
taining Cephalopodous and Coralline faunae, and which are
found in the upper part of the Jurassic system. Geologists,
mostly French, of whom M. Hebert is the best known repre-

formation and regarding the zone of Ammonites tenuilobatus as
Oxfordian because it is covered by Coraliferous beds, almit that
there is in the Alps a great gap between the Oxfordian and the
Cretaceous formations. German and Swiss geologists, on the
contrary, find in the Alps the complete series of the Upper
Jurassic system of the Jura. They have shown that Coraliferous
is developed in nearly all the horizons of these beds, and not only
in that to which D'Orbigny has given the name of Coralline stage,

Favre has found in the Western Alps of Switzerland the complete

Upper Jurassic formation Voirons. This series has the following
four divisions fiom below upwards :—I. The Oxford formation,

systems has been worked in a part of the Alps, without
any interruption in the four divisions; and if we cannot find all
the equivalents of the fosiliferous beds of the Jurassic basin, it
should be remembered that the deposits have been placed in the

IT is a somewhat singular coincidence that the two
works at the head of this article should have been
published just about the same time. We shall endeavour
briefly to show the value and bearing of each.
It is probably undeniable that an illustrated book on
any branch of natural history is more acceptable to
the public—certainly more attractive—than one wholly
devoid of pictorial illustrations; and not without good
reason, for it is well known what great assistance even
the advanced student obtains from a single glance at an

illustration, when traced by a hand well cognisant of the
point sought to be illustrated, even though the hand may
be entirely wanting in artistic power. The want, however,
of drawings to assist the comprehension of the dry details
of natural objects may be reduced to a minimum by the
presence of good diagnoses. Pleasant are those pages
where both these helps exist; dreary and uninviting indeed
(though sometimes inevitable) are long and dry details of
form, structure, and colour, when unenlivened either by
drawings or diagnoses. From such dreariness Dr. Tho-
rell's two hundred quarto pages of descriptions of spiders
(under the title given at the head of this notice) are
saved by the excellent diagnosis with which each descrip-
tion is preceded. It not unfrequently happens that a
diagnosis is a mere formal abstract of the longer descrip-
tion that succeeds it; this is, however, not the case in the
present instance, where each diagnosis puts before us just
such distinctive points of special form, structure, and
colour as the describer, were he at all able with his pencil,
would endeavour to delineate by means of rapid sketches
and dissectional drawings.
In respect to this point Dr. Thorell remarks (p. 4), that
he has " prefaced his descriptions with diagnoses, although
this is not done by the generality of modern arachnolo-
gi-,ts," it is, he says, "my firm conviction that tolerably
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
good diagnoses very greatly facilitate the determination
of unknown species, even though they be not real [by the
term real Dr. Thorell appears to mean full] definitions."
This places a diagnosis, in relation to the full description,
exactly on a par with the part delineation and dissectional
drawing when compared with a full artistic illustration;
neither the diagnosis nor the dissectional drawing, how-
ever characteristic, precludes the necessity for a full
description, nor for a full artistic illustration where it can
be had; in fact, were it not a serious question of space
and cost, amounting often to a positive bar, no natural
object could be said to be well and properly described
and illustrated without a diagnosis, such as that mentioned
Vol. xiii.—No. 328
above, a full description embracing an almost photo-
graphic accuracy of every part, and (where closely allied
forms exist) a differential description as well, besides full,
and dissectional drawings. Of course the full description
would be broken up into ordinal, family, generic, and
specific characters, each in their proper place; the three
first only requiring repetition where, in the individual

hinder extremity of the abdomen of some species of
Lathrodectus: and he refers to the known fact of the seg-
mentation of the abdomen in the embryo of spiders

Still plainer evidences of obsolete segments have been
previously noted in Erigoiie corrupts, Cambr. (Proc.
Zool. Soc, March 1875, p. 214, PL XXIX. Fig. 21), as
well as in some other species of the same genus.
Were it not for points thus incidentally raised, and
some of which have been above noticed, Dr. Thorell's
present work would be of little interest except to the
arachnological specialist; by such, however, it will be
hailed as an important and valuable addition to the lite-
rature upon European spiders; while a more general in-
terest is imparted to it by the topics here commented
upon.
It is one of the disadvantages attending the publica-

that such papers are more or less inaccessible to those

who either do not possess the journal, or who live at a
distance from a library containing it; and this disadvan-
tage is heightened when a series of papers, extending, per-
haps, over many years, is thus issued, on any one subject.
Araneologists are therefore greatly indebted to the editor
of Prof. Hentz's writings, for clearing away a disadvan-
tage of this kind, and one which has been much felt for a
considerable period.
Prof. Nicolas Marcellus Hentz, a Frenchman by birth,
but obliged to fly his native country at the downfall of the
first Napoleon, devoted much time and labour in the
United States, the land of his adoption, to the study and
collecting of spiders. After having published some few
short papers upon them, at length, in 1841, he brought
together the whole of his notes and drawings, publishing
them in a series of papers in the Journal of the Boston
Society of Natural History, at intervals from that year to
the year 1850. These papers, eight in number, and con-
tained in three vols.—iv.,v.,and vi.—of the Boston Journal,
together with two or three other papers previously pub-
lished, and an unpublished1 supplement, have now been
collected and given to the public in the present volume.
Considerable difficulties attended the attainment of this
result, especially in regard to the plates j the stones from
which the lithographic plates were taken having been

destroyed and several of the copper plates lost. The
science of photography, in the shape of the Albert-type
process, has, however, enabled the editor very success-
fully to overcome this difficulty, and the facsimile plates
produced by it are only second to those of the original
papers. In order to enable araneologists to refer to and
quote the exact page and plate of the original papers, care
has been taken to preserve the old pagination by numbers
(within brackets) inserted in the text, and to retain the
original numbering of the plates alongside of the numbers
referring to the present volume. The matter of the sup-
plement has been worked into the different descriptions,
wherever it happened to belong, though still kept sepa-
rate by means of brackets. With this exception, and the

tions of pure science in the domain of organic chemistry;
and secondly, as being of immense industrial importance
to the country. It does not enter into our province to
r.otice the work in its industrial aspect, but we have no
hesitation in stating that author and editors have per-
formed their task in a highly creditable manner. From
every point of view the work will be found useful, and we
can recommend it to the scientific chemist as well as to
dyers and calico printers.
The author, who died in 1873, had been occupied up
to the time of his death in preparing a treatise on colour-
ing matters other than aniline. The present work has
been edited from the author's MSS. with the addition of
five chapters, forming a considerable portion of the book,
on the coal-tar colours, by the editors.
The mode of treatment pursued is neatly the same for
each dye. The natural history and source of the material
from which the colour is obtained are first given, then the
chemical composition and mode of preparation or manu-
facture, and finally the method of application to the
various fabrics described. The whole subject is pro-
fusely illustrated by specimens of dyed and printed
fabrics pasted into the book.
The work is appropriately prefaced by an obituary
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
notice of the author. The first chapter treats of colour
in general and the action of different forces, chemical
agents, &c, on the various colouring matters. We must
object to the definition of colour given in this chapter.
It is defined as "the impression that the light reflected
from a surface makes upon the eye," thus excluding all
cases in which colour is caused by absorption.
Chapters II.and 111, are entirely devoted to madder dyes,
and contain, among much valuable chemical information,
a description of Prof. Stokes's optical tests for alizarin and
purpurin. The method of dyeing in Turkey red and the
action of different mordants in madder and garancin
painting is clearly explained, and the manufacture of
artificial alizarin described. Chapter IV. treats of the
red dyewoods—logwood, sapan, Lima, peach, and Brazil
woods; also of safflower and alkanet. Chapters V. and
VI. are devoted to indigo—this portion of the subject being
described inconsiderable detail. Chapter VII. contains
accounts of cochineal, kermes, gumlac, lac dye, lac lake,
and murexide, while Chapter VIII. treats of orchil,

This is altogether an admirable address, characterised
by real eloquence and by clearness and decision of view
as to the place which science ought to occupy in any
system of education. Most of Prof. Cooke's audience
were teachers by profession, attending Harvard Univer-
sity mainly to become acquainted with the experimental
methods of teaching physical science. We commend the
address not only to scientific students and teachers of
science, but to all who take an interest in education, and
to all students who desire a clear statement as to what,
in the not distant future, will be regarded as the only
liberal education, an education in which science will be
allotted a place of at least equal importance with that of
literature. What Mr. Cooke's views are on certain matters
which have for long been discussed in this journal, may
be learned from the following extracts. On the place
which Science ought to occupy in education, he says :—
"I must declare my conviction that no educated man
can expect to realise his best possibilities of usefulness
without a practical knowledge of the methods of experi-
mental science. If he is to be a physician, his whole
success will depend on the skill with which he can use
these great tools of modern civilisation. If he is to be a

lawyer, his advancement will in no small measure be
determined by the acuteness with which he can criticise
the manner in which the same tools have been used by
his own or his opponent's clients. If he is to be a cler-
gyman, he must take sides in the great conflict between
theology and science, which is now raging in the world,
and unless he wishes to play the part of the doughty
knight, Don Quixote, and think he is winning great vic-
tories by knocking down the imaginary adversaries which
his ignorance has set up, he must try the steel of his
adversary's blade
"I feel that any system of education is radically defec-
tive which does not comprise a sufficient training in the
methods of experimental science to make the mass of
our educated men familiar with this tool of modern civi-
lisation; so that when, hereafter, new conquests over
matter are announced, and great discoveries are pro-
claimed, they may be able not only to understand but
also to criticise the methods by which the assumed results
have been reached, and thus be in a position to distin-
guish between the true and the false. Whether we will

I have set down the names in order of time, and included my
own amongst them because those mentioned after me have all
confirmed my results with regard to the putrefaction of some
fluids in hermetically sealed vessels, from which the air has been
expelled by boiling; the very experiments, in fact, which Prof.
Tyndall now endeavours to impeach by his own one hundred and
thirty-nine failures.
Dr. Burdon Sanderson's well-known corroboration of the
accuracy of my results may be here reproduced. He says
(Nature, January 8, 1873):—"The accuracy of Dr. Bastian's
statement of fact with reference to the particular experiments
now under consideration has been publicly questioned. I myself
doubted it, and expressed my doubts, if not publicly, at least in
conversation. I am content to have established—at all events,
to my own satisfaction—that, by following Dr. Bastian's direc-
tions, infusions can be prepared which are not deprived by an
ebullition of from five to ten minutes of the faculty of undergoing
those chemical changes which are characterised by the presence
of swarms of Bacteria, and that the development of these organ-
isms can proceed with the greatest activity in hermetically sealed
glass vessels, from which almoslthe whole of the air had been
expelled by boiling."
And, if Prof. Tyndall and others wish to know how far these
results have since been generally recognised as correct, reference
may be made to a review of my work, "Evolution and the
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Origin of Life," by Dr. Burdon Sanderson, in the Academy of
July 10, 1875. There, in reference to the confirmation which
these experiments had received, and in relation to other work in
connection with the question generally by Samuelson and
Gscheidlen, Dr. Sanderson writes:—"As regards the trust-
worthy character of the experiments themselves, it will probably
be a sufficient guarantee to most readers that they have been
conducted under the immediate supervision of men like Pfliiger
and Hoppe-Seyler, who occupy the foremost rank as vital physi-
cists. Those who are more especially interested in the subject
will best satisfy themselves of the exactitude and completeness
with which all the investigations have been carried out by read-
ing for themselves the original papers."
Although Dr. Sanderson thus thoroughly recognises the fact
(and knows that others do the same) that many boiled fluids will
putrefy in closed vessels from which air has been expelled by
boiling, it is well known that he is not willing to regard such
facts as the proof of the occurrence of " spontaneous generation."
He admits, indeed (British Medical Journal, February 13, 1875,
p. 201), that I and others have shown that Bacteria in their
"ordinary state " are killed by a temperature of about 1400 F.;

this possible, and I for one cannot believe it until I know
whether the conflict between the two professors may not be
explained by differences in the conditions under which they
worked.
We all know how fully Professor Tyndall's time is occu-
pied, but I hope it is not too much to ask him, in the in-
terests of sciencejand for our instruction, to add to the scientific
value of his experiments on hermetically sealed flasks by pub-
lishing the details, so as to enable us to compare them
with the careful account which Prof. Sanderson gives of his,
and to judge whether we ought to trust the one or the other or—
what would be the more agreeable, and I cannot help thinking
the more likely, consequence—to trust them both in this as we
have done in so many previous investigations.

The University of London and School Examinations
Having given some assistance to the preparation of the Report
referred to in your leader of the 3rd inst., I shall be glad if you
will allow me to correct the somewhat erroneous impression
which 1 fear your article is likely to produce.
It was with some surprise that I found the Report of the Sub-

committee of the Convocation of the University of Londonforming
the subject of an editorial notice, seeing that, as yet, it is private
matter printed only for circulation among the members of the
University. At the recent meeting of Convocation I endeavoured
to explain the position which the Annual Committee occupied
with respect to this Report; and from the absence of all reference
to the subject in the notices of the meeting which appeared in
the daily papers, I had reason to think that I had succeeded in show-
ing why the matter was not yet ripe for publication. In answer
therefore to your query: "But is it easy to speak with reason-
able seriousness of an attitude like that which the Annual Com-
mittee has adopted?" I need now only state, with respect to
the Report, that it is not yet adopted by Convocation nor by the
Annual Committee.
But I am inclined to think that you have licked the opportu-
nity of carefully studying the proposals of the Sub-Committee,
or you would not have found it necessary to speak of them in
terms of "irony" or "levity."
Your article suggests that the University of London has been
asked to adopt a scheme for the examination of schools with no
higher motive than that of " entangling schoolboys in its meshes,"
and of withdrawing them from the influence of the other Uni-
versities ; and to establish this position you quote a passage from
one of the paragraphs of the Report, in which, inter alia, it is
stated that unless the University of London is prepared to take

some part in the examination of schools "the number of candidates
for the London examinations will sensibly decrease" which last
words you have printed in italics, although in the Report itself
no such prominence is given to them. It is quite true that the
graduates of Burlington Gardens consider that the influence which
their examinations exert on education is, on the whole, beneficial.
They are consequently desirous that that influence should if pos-
sible be extended, and would view with regret, as the Report
suggests, any cause that might tend to dissociate from the Uni-
versity of London those schools which hitherto had acted as
feeders to it. But is it quite fair to characterise this honest en-
deavour to improve school-teaching as an attempt to entangle
schoolboys within the meshes of the University?
Your article further states that the Annual Committee have not
a word to say as to the efficiency of the work in which the
ancient Universities have for many years been successfully
engaged. Indeed they have : but it is not likely to be found in
the Report of the Sub-committeei The several weighty reasons
which have induced Convocation to request the Senate to under-
take the examination and inspection of schools have been

document which was communicated to every member of that
body, and the consideration of which formed part of its proceed-
ings, can only by a legal fiction be described as confidential. But
the pica that the document was confidential practically abandons
the defence of it. A really statesmanlike paper on a matter
which affects all the higher grade schools of the country would
gain rather than lose by publicity.
The course which Convocation has under consideration has no
doubt, as our correspondents point out, much to be said in i's
favour. But the reason actually put forward in the preamble of
the Report as a ground for taking action, is from the point of view
of public policy simply indefensible. It would be appropriate
enough if the Report had been addressed by a Boird of Directors
to the shareholders of a Limited Liability Company, because in
the fashion characteristic of such documents it treated the matter
in hand from the strictly business point of view of the "con-
cern." It is this attitude which we described as cynical. And
we must repeat that it is not in our opinion decorous that a
matter gravely affecting the higher education of the country
should be treated simply as a question of the falling off of
examiners at one particular centre of examination. If it is not

Public Analysts
In your last week's issue your correspondent, Mr. M. Williams,
writes in such terms as would lead your readers to suppose that
much less has been done in the matter of butter analysis than is
really the case.
I have not the letter before me at this moment, and therefore
speak from memory, but I believe that your readers are led to
understand that no analyses of pure butter and of pure butter
mixed with known quantities of foreign fats have been published.
In this he is mistaken, for in a little work published in 1874, the
details of eleven experiments upon butters known to be pure are
given. The samples were purchased from outlying country
farms in the Isle of Wight, and the results of the analyses fairly
prove the constancy of the fixed fatty acids in butter.
It is also shown that all foreign fats likely to be used as
adulterants are constant in their composition, and that they yield
a much larger percentage of fixed acids than does butter; the
range of difference being wide enojgh to offer a practical basis
upon which to found accurate estimations of foreign fats in fac-
titious butters. Many admixtures were made, and the published
result* of the analyses prove the practicability of the method

employed. Your correspondent hints that no one dares to un-
dertake the analysis of mixtures of known constitution. I ven-
ture to state that if the necessary provisions could be made
against concoctions chemically prepared, and so as to admit of
commercial admixtures only, such as would be likely to be made
use of by fraudulent butter factors, there would be no difficulty
in getting half-a-dozen or more analysts ready to take up the
gauntlet. Arthur Angei.l

It rolled slowly across the sou'hern sky, and its path was slightly
descending from left t-> right The observed part of its course
was from y Orionis to a few degrees below a Ceti. There was
no train, but the moon was shining brightly at the time, and
may have overpowered any faint appendage of this sort. It was
many limes brighter than Venus (then near setting), and esti-
mated to equal one-fifth the moon's apparent diameter. The
globular form of the nucleus was very evident.

THE DRAINAGE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE.
THE Dutch are a people who in many respects com-
mand the respect of the world. Their little country
possesses comparatively few natural resources, and yet
they have made so much of it, and they have been com-
pelled to cultivate the virtues of frugality and industry to

such an extent, that the people as a whole are probably
better off than those of any other country in the world.
Small as the country is, it is only by the exercise of great
skill and constant watchfulness that they are able to pre-
vent its being overwhelmed by the German Ocean. In this
unfortunately they have not always been successful. Over
and over again has the sea burst in upon them, laying waste
their dearly-loved country, and sweeping away thousands
of the inhabitants. It has only been after many severe
lessons that they have learned how to keep the invader
back. And within recent years they themselves have
taken the offensive, and determined to drive out old Nep-
tune from lands which he has possessed for centuries.
Even in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they
succeeded in draining many small areas of land, and
during the present century many marshes and lakes have
been brought under cultivation, including Lake Haarlem,
upwards of 40,000 acres in extent. In this way about 350
square miles of land, mostly devoted to pasture, have been
reclaimed, and that entirely by means of windmills.

lines, and works preparatory to bringing the new lands
under culture.
The interest on the above sum will raise it to
13,400,000/., but one-fourth of this will be granted as a
subsidy by government, which will be amply compensated
by the comparatively enormous addition to its small
territory.
Of the 473,000 acres to be drained, four-fifths, as we have
said, are of great value, composed as they are of a bed of
more than a metre thick of the most fertile mud deposited
for centuries by the Yssel and other rivers of which the
Zuyder Zee is the receptacle. Only one-fifth consists of
land of less value and of sands which will be useful in
constructing the base of the dike, or to establish large
reservoirs, indispensable in all drainage work, for the
reception of the waters until they can be conveyed to the
sea. Deduction being made for the land absorbed by
these works, by canals, dikes, roads, &c. &c, there will
remain upwards of 400,000 acres suitable for culture, and
the selling value of which ought considerably to exceed
the expenses of the enterprise. Every one must wish

THE BIRDS OF NORTH-EASTERN AFRICA^
BARON THEODORVON HEUGLIN is well known
as one of the most active and successful of the
travellers and naturalists of Germany—one who may
fairly rank with the Wallaces and Bates of our own
country—as regards the extent of his researches. No
man living has devoted more time and toil to the inves-
tigation of the Fauna of North-eastern Africa, and as
regards the classes of birds and mammals, no man living
has a better acquaintance with them. Twelve years
passed on the coasts and islands of the Red Sea, in the
marshes and jungles of the White Nile, and in the High-
lands of Abyssinia, during which time constant attention
was devoted to the observation and collection of animals
have given Herr von Heuglin unrivalled opportunities for
amassing this knowledge, to which his skill as an artist
has contributed additional facilities. Soon after returning
from his last journey in 1865, Herr von Heuglin planned a
general work on the Ornithology of North-eastern Africa
to embrace all the notes and observations collected
during his different excursions, together with the infor-
mation acquired by the study of specimens from these
countries already existing in the continental museums.

In 1869, the first part of the present work was issued, but
its large extent hindered its progress, and the author was
called away to join the German Expeditions to Nova
Zembla and the extreme north, to which he was attached
as naturalist. It was not, therefore, until the close of last
year, or, we believe we may say until the beginning of the
present year, that the concluding part of the Ornithology
of North-eastern Africa was issued from the press.
Completed, it now forms four volumes, illustrated by
fifty-one coloured plates and a map of the region of
which it treats, and is by far the most perfect work on
the subject hitherto published. Prior to the completion
of the present work Riippell's Atlas, and other publi-
cations were, so far as regards Nubia and Abyssinia,
the only works of reference, whilst of the district of
the White Nile so fully explored by Von Heuglin,
very little was known except from fragmentary no-
tices. In the piesent extended work the ornithology
of the whole of these countries, together with that of
Egypt, the Red Sea, and Northern Somali-land, are
treated of together. The sum of species of birds is thus

It may be worth mentioning that in the lower Alpine
localities (for instance, near Valcava, 1,500 m., and near

is intermediate between the large flowered form of V. tri-
color (Nature, vol. ix. p. 46, Fig. 15) and V. calcarata
(Fig. 82). The flowers of this variety, which is called
alpcstris, are 25-30 mm. long, and 18-22 mm. broad ; the
three lower petals are yellow near their base, as in
our tricolor and calcarata, marked with black streaks
converging towards the entrance of the flower; the two
upper petals are very variable in colour, white, or bluish,
or yellow, with a large bluish margin. The spur is also

common form of this species may have been gradually
modified into V. calcarata.
Another Alpine flower, remarkable from its conspicuous-
ness and adapted to Lepidoptera, is Liliitm bulbiferum
(Fig. 86-88), which I found on stony slopes of the Schan-
fick valley, near Chur, in the Spoel Valley, near Zernetz.
and, somewhat more frequently, in shelving meadows of
the valley of Sulden, beneath the Order (1,700-1,Soo m.
above the sea-level). Although in most points of its
structure agreeing with Lilium Afartagon, described in my
article X. (Nature, vol. xii. p. 50), this flower may be of
some interest, because it shows by what slight modifica-
tions a sphingophilous species may be adapted to diurnal
Lepidoptera, or vice verstt. The number and arrange-
ment of the parts of the flower and the structure of the
nectary (Figs. 87, 88) are, indeed, the same in L. bulbi-
fp um as in L. Marlagon. That, nevertheless, the latter
is cross-fertilised by Sphingidas, the former by diurnal
Lepidoptera, is proved by the following differences:—

Although, by the contrivances now described Lilium
bulbiferum, from its very conspicuous flowers, is very likely
to be cross-fertilised by butterflies in sunny weather, still
in rainy periods many flowers may wither without having
received any visit from a butterfly. Hence the possibility
of self-fertilisation appears to be indispensable both to L.
bulbiferum and to /.. Afartagon. In both the anthers
and stigma are simultaneously developed to maturity, and

fertilisation may thus be effected in case cross-fertilisation
by visiting Lepidopteri is wanting.

Mar/agon is really fertilised by Sphingidae, for instance
by Macroglossa stellatarum, as observed by myself (see
Naturf., vol. xii. p. 50), and by Sphinx euphorbia, as
observed by Federico Delpino ;' and that L. bulbiferum

THE following is a list of the Scholarships and Exhibitions for
proficiency in Natural Science to be offered at the several
Colleges and for Non-Collegiate Students in Cambridge during
the present year :— .
Trinity College.—One or more Foundation Scholarships ot loot.
and one Exhibition of 50/. The examination for these will com-
mence on April 18. The Scholarships are open to undergraduates
of Trinity College, and persons under twenty who are not yet
resident members of the University. The Exhibition is open to
persons under twenty, who have not yet commenced residence at
the University. , , „,,
St. Johns College.—-One of the value of 50/. per annum, -the

22 and will be open to all persons who have not commenced re-
sidence at the University, as well as to all who have entered and
have not completed one term of residence. No candidate will
be examined in more than three of the above subjects. There b
a separate examination in Natural Science at the time of the
annual College examination at the end of the academical year, in
May; and Exhibitions and Foundation Scholarships will be
awarded to students who show an amount of knowledge equiva-

NATURE
THE INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF
OXYGEN1
T AVOISIER, who was the first to recognise in its widest
range the importance of oxygen, was also the first who
succeeded in making a practical use of it. "It is evident," he
writes, * '' that atmospheric air is not the best calculated means to
increase the effect of fire; for, when a volume of air is conveyed
through the bellows to red-hot coals, three (?) parts of noxious
or at least useless gas are conveyed with every one part of the
useful kind of air; consequently, if the latter could be employed
for combustion in its pure state, the action of the fire would be
greatly increased. Doubtless this idea has occurred to many others
before me ; indeed, I hear that M. Achard3 has already tried the
experiment, but as yet a cheap and convenient apparatus is want-
ing." Lavoisier first used the bladders of animals, which were
provided with cocks and tubes. "Then," continued he, "Imadea
hole with a knife from three to four lines deep in a large piece
of charcoal and placed in it six grs. of platinum. I then ignited
the charcoal through the blowpipe communicating with the enamel
lamp, uncocked my apparatus, and blew the pure vital air into
the cavity. The coal burnt very rapidly with detonation (such
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
as is produced by fusing saltpetre) and with dazzling brightness;
in a few moments the platinum was fused to grains, which soon
united into a drop. The fusion was effected equally well when
using commercial platinum as when using that, which had been
deprived of its magnetic parts by the magnet Hitherto, it is
well known, platinum had been considered infusible." In the
course of the same year Lavoisier * improved his apparatus with
the assistance of Meusnier, and soon became possessed of a
gasometer consisting of two boxes greatly resembling, on a small
scale, the well-known reservoirs used in gasworks for holding
coal-gas. About the same time Saron had constructed two
blow-pipes (chalunuaux), one to furnish oxygen, and the other
hydrogen gas.
^By their help Lavoisier did not succeed in melting platinum.5
However, at that time he and Saron had conceived the idea of
constructing an improved blow-pipe, in which the oxygen should
surround the hydrogen, and this led to the contrivance of the
oxyhydrogen blow-pipe, which has ever since been of such sub-
stantial service in the working of platinum and the soldering of
lead.
No further attempts were made to fuse platinum by means of
oxygen until Deville and Debray 6 in 1857-1859 and the years fol-
lowing, published their excellent researches "On the platinum
metals," and brought the fusion of platinum into practice. The
soldering of platinum with platinum, and the manufacturing of
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
cast bars, were carried on on a large scale, first by Messrs. John-
son, Matthey, and Co., in London, and afterwards, though on a
smaller scale, by Heraeus in Hanau. The experiments of
Debray and Deville were attended with one especial result,
the discovery of a fire-proof material for making furnaces and
crucibles. This is quicklime, which had the further advantage
of retaining the heat as completely as possible. Besides, the
temperature was increased by conducting the flame from above,
directly, to the surface of the metal, and regulating the quantity
of oxygen and hydrogen as theory and practice suggested it. To
melt 2 kilogs. of platinum, theory demands 55 litres oxygen and
110 litres hydrogen, while in reality more than one kilog. is fused
by these quantities, so that not 50 per cent, of the generated heat is
lost (a very satisfactory result). Their experiments were of still
greater importance for the history of oxygen industry, inasmuch
as they gave occasion for comparing the prices of different modes
of preparing it, and stimulated inquiry after cheaper processes.
These we may divide into chemical and mechanical, subdividing
the former again into continuous and intermittent processes. Up
to this time the following modes of preparation were in use, or
had been proposed. To begin with the oldest method of Priestley,

NA TURE
this process the cost of melting 1 kilog. of platinum was reduced
to 20 or 30 centimes. According to a notice of Moigno,1 the
firm of Jose de Susini and Co., in Paris, in the year 1867
prepared oxygen in this way at the low price of C85 fr. per
cb.m., retransforming sulphurous into sulphuric acid. Instead
of the acid itself, Deville and Debray also proposed employing
sulphate of zinc: 100 kg. of anhydrous salt yielded them 6'8
cb.m. of oxygen (far more therefore than the best peroxide of
manganese), 22 kilogs. of sulphurous acid gas, and 51 kilogs. of
oxide of zinc.
Wagner's statement8 is worthy of remark, that in the year
1867 neither of these methods was in use in Deville's own
laboratory; perhaps because the sulphurous acid evolved com-
plicated the working.
We must not pass over Archereau's attempt3 to employ
sulphuric acid in its cheapest combination as gypsum. He
asserted that heating pulverised gypsum with sand would pro-
duce silicate of calci-jm, setting sulphurous acid free, which he
partly condensed (as did also Susini) under a pressure of three
atmospheres, and partly removed by means of a thin paste of
lime. A manufactory established on these principles in Paris

did not work long.1 Obviously the very high temperature
required is an obstacle. The production of this gas from one of
the oldest of all oxidising agents, saltpetre, was not employed on
acccmt of two drawbacks. In the first place, a quantity of
nitrogen is mixed with it; and secondly, the temperature
necessary for its decomposition greatly increases the cost. This
last inconvenience was remedied by Webster's6 adding oxide of
zinc to saltpetre: 20 lbs. of nitrate of soda and 4 lbs. of crude
oxide of zinc furnished 94676 cubic feet of a mixture of 59 p. c.
of oxygen and 41 p. c. of nitrogen, while chiefly oxide of zinc
and caustic soda remained. The price of the oxygen contained
in this mixture, so useful for many purposes, without taking
into consideration the value of the solid residue, amounts6 to
2-32; and allowing for the value of the remains, the price is
reduced to 078 fr.
In no one of these methods appears one of the leading ideas
of modern industry, viz., the regeneration of the residues.
The following plans were happier in this respect, and thereby,
in part, more successful.
To combine chemically the oxygen of the air with a carrier of
oxygen that would easily give off the gas, and would be always
ready to take up and again to give off fresh quantities of oxygen,
just as mercury does when we transform it into its oxide and
retransform the oxide into the metallic state—that is the
problem of which the last few years have given an economical

solution. As early as 1829 Dingier jun." discovered that oxide
of copper as well as peroxide of cobalt and nickel, treated
with an excess of chloride of lime, generate oxygen gas, thereby
transforming it into chloride of calcium. In :he year 1845
Mitschcrlich8 observed that many other metallic oxides, viz.
peroxide of manganese, hydrate of ferric oxide, cupric oxide,
&c, when added to a solution of chloride of lime, caused a
development of pure oxygen. In 1865, Th. Fleitman9 renewed
these observations with reference to freshly prepared sesquioxide
of cobalt, the smallest trace of which was sufficient completely
to reduce a concentrated solution of chloride of lime into
chloride of calcium and oxygen. For practical purposes he recom-
mended to heat to 700 or 80° a highly concentrated solution of
chloride of lime (which to avoid frothing over should be previously
cleared by filtration) with o'l to 0'5 per cent, of sesquioxide of
cobalt. By applying chloride of lime containing 35 per cent, of
pure hypochlorite, he obtained from twenty to thirty volumes
of oxygen in a regular stream ; and other observers, notably
F. Varrentrapp,10 confirmed these results, and commended their
industrial application. The sesquioxide of cobalt need not be
added ready formed; any cobalt salt answers the same purpose,

method was employed at Cologne in 1871.' A company formed
in Paris for its employment had but a very briel existence,5 pro-
bably owing to a similar discovery which soon supplanted the
one described above.
This method, originated and perfected since 1867,' by
the inventive powers of M. Tessie du Motay, employs per-
oxide of manganese as the carrier of oxygen, and takes its
stand upon the following reactions. Sodic hydrate exposed to
dark red heat with manganese and air, yields, as Mitscherlich
discovered, manganate of sodium and water, 4NaOH + 2Mn02
+ 2O = 2 Na2Mn04 + 2HaO; and manganate of sodium,
under the influence of a dry current of overheated steam, disen-
gages at the same temperature sodic hydrate, manganic sesqui-
oxide, and free oxygen, 2Na2Mn04 + 2H.O = 4NaOH + Mn,
03 + 3O. ISy previously depriving the overheated air of its
carbonic acid, one may preserve the mixture in a perpetually
active state. This method has been thoroughly tested and ap-
proved, and has since been employed on a large scale in Comines,
near Lille ; in Pantin, near Paris; in New York, in Brussels,
and in Vienna. Bothe * informs us.that a mixture of sixty parts
of dry carbonate of sodium with forty parts of 95 per cent, per-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
oxide of manganese, when fused, contains 74 62 parts of man-
ganate of sodium, and that 40 kilogs. of this mixture, which,
according to calculation, should give 2,036 cb.m. of oxygen gas,
produced in reality 1,800 cb.m., or 90per cent, of the theoretical
yield. He recommends the proceeding as a very practical one.
M. Pourcel 5 has given us* the most detailed description. Ac-
cording to him, M. Tessie du Motay employs cast-iron ellip-
soidal .retorts, which lie horizontally one beside the other, and
are divided by a grating parallel to their axes, into two unequal
parts. Over the grating 350 kilogs. of manganate of sodium, or of
the reduced mixture ot manganese and soda, are so spread out
that its height amounts to 0'6o m., and the empty space above
and below the mass is as inconsiderable as possible. In
Comines, where five of these retorts are uced, the amount
of oxygen produced daily is 140 cb.m. at the cost of 450 kilogs.
of coals for heating the retorts, and of 150 kilogs. used for
the steam-engine. The air is passed through a thin iron
vessel with quick-lime by means of the bellows, under a pressure
of frjm 3 to 4 cm. of mercury, and enters the retort from above.
The temperature of the latter can be observed through a hole
provided with an iron stopper. In this way the air gives off
only about half of its oxygen, so that to produce I vol. of oxygen
10 vol. of air must be passed through, the remainder escaping
into the atmosphere. Five minutes suffice for oxidising the
reduced mass. The current of air is then interrupted by means
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of a three-way stopcock and superheated steam passed through
the retorts for five minutes, while the gas, passing out below the
grating, enters condensers. Here a fine rain of cold water frees
the oxygen from the steam, and the gas enters the gasometer
under the pressure of a column of water of from 8 to 10 cm. in
height. Thus reduction and oxidation alternate at intervals of five
minutes. After a lapse of six hours only, it is necessary, for a
perlect regeneration ot the fused mass, to admit atmospheric air
for about an hour, because the quantity of oxygen obtained
becomes lowered after five or six hours, down to half or even a
third part of the original quantity. In Vienna the cocks are
worked by an automatic apparatus. The longer the steam is
forced in and the retorts freed from air before the communication
with the gasometer is opened, the purer will be the oxygen;
half a minute is enough to leave only 15 per cent, of nitrogen
mixed with it, provided the injurious space in the retort be kept
as small as possible. If the nitrogen be lowered to 4 per cent.,
which is easily effected, the sacrifice of oxygen will be so much
the greater. To make certain that the quantity of nitrogen
r en 1.1 ins within the limits of 15 and 10 percent., which are proved
to be the most practicable, gas is taken from the gasometer or

one more rarity to the already remarkable sponge fauna of the
Philippines. The siliceous skeleton of Dendrospongw steereii
bears resemblance to a branching coral or shrub, and is nearly
three feet high. A peculiar rosette-like series of tufts form a
continuous whorl, winding spirally up the branches. Micro-
scopical examination shows the spicules to belong to the sex-
radiate type: the character of these, with the presence of a veil
and other structural points, indicate its being an intermediate
type between such forms as Dactylocalyx, Aphrocallistes, Hol-
tenia, and Meyerina. The homology of the so-called root, body,
and beard spicules of several of the siliceous sponges being noted,
those of Dendrospongia are compared ; the spiral tufts of the
latter agreeing in many respects with the spicular fringes of

of the electrolyte? To test the fint point experiments were made
with a voltameter containing dilate sulphuric acid which had
been previously boiled, the voltameter being connected with a
Sprengel pump. The platinum plates were acted on by a very
small external electromotive force for one minute, and the effect of
the polarisation current due to this action noticed on an extremely
delicate galvanometer, the effect of the direct current employed
being also noted. After a series of observations had been made,
using different amounts of electromotive force, the dilute acid was
removed, and, after being thoroughly aerated, replaced in the vol-
tameter. On repeating the experiments with this one change in
the conditions, the results obtained were almost identical, from
which fact the author concludes that the first question may be
answered in the affirmative. With regard to the second, Mr.
Fleming believes that the assertion that polarisation is decompo-
sition of the electrolyte has never been called in question, and in
proof of it, describes an experiment showing that when acidu-
lated water flows rapidly past slightly polarised plates, the cur-
rent which they give is very much diminished, while by causing

the water to flow slowly but slight change is produced. This
seems to indicate that there is something on the plates which can
be wiped off mechanically, and it can only he a product of elec-
trolysis.—Prof. Foster, while admitting the accuracy of Mr.
Fleming's experiments, doubted whether he was justified in
definitely ascribing polarisation to chemical action. He thinks
that, even though the effect be proved not to be due to dissolved
air, we must look for some cause other than chemical action.
For it has long been acknowledged that the decomposition of
water requires an electromotive force considerably in excess of
that employed in these experiments.—Prof. Gladstone then
made a brief communication on the photography of fluorescent
substances. He exhibited several photographs taken of white
paper on which devices had been previously drawn, with solu-
tions of sulphate of quinine, cesculine, \c, and one was taken
in the room. He remarked that the leaves of trees come out
dark in a negative, as they contain the fluorescent substance
chlorophyll, and suggested that the irregularities of colour
observed in photographs of oil paintings are probably due to the
intermixture of fluorescent substances in the paints used.—Mr.
Meldola referred to Prof. Vogel's experiments on the effect pro-
duced on the resulting photograph by the addition of a fluor-
escent substance to the collodion, thereby increasing the sensi-
tiveness of the plate to particular rays.—Mr. S. P. Thompson,

Houston, and others upon the new phase of electric manifesta-

faint spark, the only evidence, in fact, yet known of its exist-
ence. It may be obtained from the iron core of any electro-

that the butterflies have as a whole been developed from the
Bombycida^though that development has probably been accom-

are the Tineids, the lowest family of Lepidoptera ; these may be
regarded as constituting a persistent type like that of Terebra-

acts as a preservative ; the alcoholic extract of hemlock, however,
acts poisonously on plants. 2. When locally applied, conia pro-
duces a progressive loss of functional power in every highly
organised tissue with which it comes into contact. 3. In inducing
complete repose of the muscular system, conia powerfully pre-
disposes to sleep, but it is not a hypnotic in the sense that opium
is. 4. The convulsions produced by a poisonous dose of hemlock
.ire cerebral, and not spinal, as has heretofore been imagined.

THE LISBON MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS
Annaes do Observatorio do Infanlo D. Luis. Magnetismo
Terrestre. Lisbon Imprensa National. (1870,1874)
THAT in 1858 Portugal entered into "the Magnetic
Union of Nations, founded by Gauss and by Hum-
boldt in \ 832," was due to the enlightened solicitude of
the King Luiz I. for the progress of science. The
observatory founded by him at Lisbon, and placed under
the care of the late Mr. de Silviera, has during the last
few years been directed by Mr. de Brito Capello, who had
previously the oversight of the magnetic department, and
to whom we believe the results in the two parts of
Annals before us are chiefly due.
The value of the Lisbon observations and of these
results is so much the greater that the neighbouring
country, Spain, has done nothing for terrestrial magnetism,
and even France, which stands so high in science, has
given us no such series of observations since Arago
originated them by the devotion of years to the move-
ment of the magnetic needle.
The first part of the Annals before us (1870) treats of

the results for the magnetic declination derived from direct
observations made at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. (1858-1868), and for
the diurnal variations (1864-1868) from a photographic
registering apparatus similar to that at Kew. The secular
variation is first investigated. This mysterious movement,
which we can attribute to no known cause, as it has no
known period, is shown at Lisbon by a mean approach of
the north end of the needle to the north at the rate of 5"9
a year during ten years, but varying from a minimum of
4'-8 in 1858-9, to 8''2 in 1866-7. An annual law has also
been found consisting of an oscillation of i'vj, the needle
being nearest the north in June, and farthest from it in
December and January.
The diurnal variation at Lisbon resembles to a con-
siderable extent that obtained at more northern stations
in Europe. The periodic variation of the mean range of
this oscillation, first discovered by Dr. Lamont, which
occupies from ten to twelve years, has also been found at
Lisbon. This investigation has its importance increased
by the fact that the greatest and least mean oscillations
happen at the same times as the maximum and minimum
frequency of solar spots. The coincidence first indicated
by Sir E. Sabine, with reference to magnetic disturbances,
was remarked independently by Dr. Rudolph Wolf, of
Zurich, who has made it the subject of an extensive and

valuable series of investigations. Dr. Lamont, com-
mencing with Cassini's observations, has found the mean
duration of the magnetic period to be 10-43 years, while
Dr. Wolf obtains irn years from a longer, though per-
haps less certain, series of solar spot observations. Since
there can be no doubt that the yearly variation of sun-
spots and of the amplitude of the diurnal oscillation of
the magnetic needle follow the same law and depend on
the same cause, every new determination of the epochs of
maxima and minima is of value, fixing points which will
determine the mean duration and variable length of the
period, and thus probably lead us to a knowledge of the

common cause. The Lisbon observations give 1859*9
and 1867*0 as epochs of maximum and minimum, agree-
ing very nearly with those derived from the Munich and
Trevandrum observations. In the determination of the
mean duration, everything depends on where we com-
mence. If we begin with Arago's magnetic observations,
the mean duration is about 10*7 years; if we take the
most accurate results for the sunspot area from Messrs.

earth's magnetism is a maximum near the solstices, and
a minimum near the equinoxes.
The diurnal variations of horizontal force, deduced
from the photographic registration of the bifilar magneto-
meter, follow laws similar to those at Munich, and not
differing greatly from those at Makerstoun, 170 further
north ; the minimum, however, shifting from near 9 A.M.
in summer to about 2 P.M. in winter.
The balance magnetometer seems to be the least certain
of the variation instruments at Lisbon. The temperature
coefficient (obtained by heating the air with gas jets) has
been found with an opposite sign to that due to varia-
tions of the needle's magnetism, a result which is always
unsatisfactory even when the variations of temperature
are small as they are at Lisbon. The diurnal variation
of the vertical magnetic force differs considerably from
that obtained at more northern observatories, the mini-
mum occurring in each month of the year near noon, and
the maximum near 5 p.m.
Mr. Capello has evidently bestowed much pains on the
determination of his instrumental constants, and this pub-

lication of results contains a valuable contribution to our
knowledge of the magnetic laws for an important station,
near the most southerly and westerly point in Europe.
Lisbon, like nearly every other magnetic observatory, has
been obliged to be satisfied with single instruments of
each kind. When so many observatories were founded
between thirty and forty years ago, there was perhaps an
over confidence in the excellence of the instruments em-
ployed, and in the certitude of being able to correct
the observations to be obtained from them for every
possible error. There was also the economical considera-
tion connected with the expense of a double series of
instruments, as well as the additional labour incurred in
observing two instruments for the same purpose. The
consequence has been, to take a single illustration, that
no two observatories have given exactly the same law for
the annual variation of the mean position of the magnetic
needle. One observatory has contradicted another, the
results from a good instrument have been balanced by
those from a bad one, and in other cases it has not been
possible to determine whether the differences found at two
stations were really due to difference of locality only, or to
instrumental causes.
When we remember the vast labour (to omit every
other consideration) expended in obtaining the laws of

magnetic variations, it cannot be too much regretted that
every observatory was not furnished with a double series
of instruments, which would have shown by their agree-
ment or disagreement the accuracy or error of the results
obtained from them. In the case of disagreement the
director of the observatory would have been warned that
some error existed whose cause should be sought out.
No preliminary trials can ensure that an instrument will
remain with exactly the same errors. If we could sup-
pose that the captain of a ship would set sail on a lengthy
and costly voyage with a single chronometer, without any
means of verifying the accuracy of its going except the
meeting with another ship in a like predicament, and
should then find that, according to their chronometers,
they were on opposite sides of the globe, we should have
a parallel to a not uncommon case in the work of many
magnetic observatories.
It is to be hoped for the future that such differences
will not be allowed to exist, that each observatory will
have the means of proving that, for its locality at least,
the laws obtained are true, and that in publishing the

The few silver coins of the series weigh about 44 grains,
or 2-9 grammes each. The copper coins vary in weight
from 43 to 163 grains, or 2'8 to 170 grammes.
The Arab systems of money and of weight are treated
at great length in Queipo's "Systemes Mdtriques et
Monctaires des Anciens Peuples." The earlier gold unit
was the dinar, and the later gold unit the michtal. The
dinar was the monetary unit, from the Roman denarius.
The michtal, which signifies weight, was the unit of
monetary weight. Oueipo gives a list of 263 gold dinars
of the ancient Eastern caliphs which are now in various
numismatic cabinets, with their weights. No coins were
struck by Mahomet and his successors, who used the
existing coinage of the countries, until the 78th year of
the Hegira, when both gold and silver coins were struck
by Abdelmelik, Caliph of Bagdad. The mean or normal
weight of the gold dinar was 66 grains, or 4"25 grammes.
This was the weight of the Attic drachma, from which it
was evidently derived. There were also gold coins of
\, i, Jf, and f.r dinar.

the gold dinar was as 7 to 10, or nearly as 2 to 3. Queipo
gives a list of 592 Arab silver dirhem coins of Arabian
caliphs from a.d. 699 to 1195, with the weight of each
coin. This varied from about 2'5 grammes in the earlier
part of this period up to a maximum weight of 3'!
grammes in later times, the mean weight of the dirhem
being 2-84 grammes, or 44 grains. He mentions also
silver coins of \, ^, and \ dirhem. The half dirhem was
thus nearly equivalent to our Saxon penny, the j}0th of
a pound of silver, and weighing 22^ troy grains.
Queipo makes but little mention of the Arab ancient
copper moneys, except to throw a doubt on the existence
cf the fels as a copper coin, and to assume that it was
only money of account, and also that the number of
fels in a dirhem expressed merely the number of units
corresponding with the value of copper in relation to
silver. He shows that in the first centuries of the Hegira,
the value of silver to gold was as 1 to 13, and of copper
to silver as 1 to 120. If, therefore, a gold dinar weighed
4'2j grammes, its equivalent in copper would weigh 6,630
grammes; and as the number of/els in a dinar could not
have exceeded 98, that this would give the improbable
weight of 6765 grammes to each copper fels. This was
the weight of the Attic drachma, from which it was evi-
dently derived. There were also gold coins of \, J, J,

chief forms of its utility. In this attempt he has suc-

are devoted to the symbols, signs, and elementary rules;

already stated that the ants farm scale-insects in the cells of the
Imbauba stem, and he believes that their presence must be bene-
ficial. This is no doubt the case ; for they protect the young leaves
against the leaf-cutting ants (Oecodoma). Now there is a wonder-
ful contrivance by which, as in the case of the "bull's-hom acacia,"
the attendance of the ants at the right time and place is secured.

ripe, emerge at the surface of the cushion, like asparagus on a
bed, and are then greedily gathered by the ants and carried
away to the nest. The object of the dense hair-cushion appears
to be (1) to secure to the young club-shaped bodies the moisture
necesary for their development; and (2) to prevent the ants from
gathering the unripe bodies. In most cases it is by honey-
aecreting glands that the protecting ants are attracted; now

on the calyx and young leaves of a Passion- flower were less
attractive to the ants than were the scale-insects living on the
stems; this would most likely be the case with the Imbauba, and
it is probable that the use of the little pear-shaped bodies ii to
form an attraction stronger than that of the scale-insects, and
thus to secure the attendance of the protective ants on the
young leaves. As far as I could make out, the club-shaped
bodies consist mainly of an albuminous substance. The
¦at colonies are founded by fertilised females, which may be
found frequently in the cells of young Imbauba plants. Each
internode has on the outside, near its upper end, a small pit
where the wall of the cell is much thinner than anywhere else,
and where the female makes a hole by which she enters. Soon
after this the hole is completely shut again by a luxuriant excres-
cence from its margins, and so it remains until about a dozen
workers have developed from the eggs of the female, when
the hole is opened anew from within by these workers. It
would appear that the female ants, living in cells closed all
aruund, must be protected against any enemy ; but notwithstand-

In the short notice in Nature (vol. xiii. p. 257) of my paper
on the Evolution of Hemoglobin, in the Quarterly Microscopical
Journal, it is said that my conclusions are mainly based on a
small diffeience in the wave-length of the absorption-bands of
the spectrum of the red blood of Planorbis. This is, however,
a very small part of the question. The principal results are that
hiematin is first met with in the bile of many pulmoniferous
molluscs in an abnormal state, cjuite unfit to serve the purposes
of respiration, but easily changed into the normal, which could,
and probably does in some cases, perform that function. Then
in tlie blood of Planorbis we have a solution of a haemoglobin,
in which the haematin is combined with an albuminous consti-
tuent coagulating at the low temperature of 45" C, and fina'ly
we come to the normal haemoglobin existing as red eorpscu/es, con-
taining an entirely different albuminous constituent, coagulated at
about 650 C. In all these changes in the condition of the ss me
fundamental radical, the oxygen carrier becomes of more and
more unstable character, and more fated for the purposes of
respiration, as we advance from lower to higher types, as though
advantage had been taken of every improvement due to modi-
fied chemical or physical constiuiion. H. C. Sorby

Saturn's Rings.—In the last (January) number of
the "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical So-
ciety" are reproduced some old drawings of Saturn,
given in the edition of Gassendi's works published at
Lyons, in six volumes, in 1658 (Lalande, Bibliographic
Astronomique, p. 245).
In the volume entitled De Annulo Saturni, by E. M.
Beima (Augsburg, 1842), a work less known in this
country than it deserves to be, will be found other repro-
ductions of the earlier drawings illustrating the appear-
ances which the planet was thought to present in the
imperfect telescopes of the time. As a pretty complete
monograph up to the date of publication, involving an
exposition of the formulae required in calculating the
various phases of the rings, &c, Beima's treatise will be
found a very desirable addition to an astronomical
library.

105° i''6;hence, the least distance of the planet from
the orbit of Jupiter is reduced to 0-564 of the earth's
mean distance from the sun. So near an approach might
afford an excellent opportunity of determining the value
of Jupiter's mass, but if the period of revolution assigned
by Kuhnert upon eight-weeks' observations is at all ap-
proximate, such opportunity will not occur for many
years to come. There may be a difficulty in recovering
this planet at the next opposition, which is likely to take
place near the aphelion, and when its faintness, owing to
great distance from the earth, will be considerable; it is
the more desirable, therefore, that observations should be
obtained in the next period of absence of moonlight, that
the mean motion may be fairly determined this season;
the Ephemeris published in No. 2,075 °f 'he Astrono-
mische Nachricnten should render the identification of
the planet a matter of no great difficulty in instruments
of adequate aperture.
From the rlsumi of observations in No. 42 of the Cir-
culars of the Berliner Astronomische Jahrbuch, it appears
that No. 149 may get adrift, unless an observation on
Nov. 2 can be proved to belong to it, and No. 155, as
already remarked, is in even worse position.

this condition are seen in the Marsupials, and in a still
higher degree in the small order of Monotremes. These
present a marked approach to the Sauropsida, or reptile
and bird group. Such semi-transitional forms, as they
may be called, furnish valuable indications of the route
by which the higher types might have been brought
about, and appear, upon the evolutionary hypothesis, to
be unmodified survivors of a condition which was only
transitory in the large bulk of the class. Their value as
evidence for gradual development would be greatly
strengthened if corroborated by palaeontology. Beyond
them nothing is known in the present condition of life of
any truly intermediate forms between the Mammalia and
the other class of vertebrates, and the same must be said,
as far as we know at present, of all former ages. The
line which we now draw round the class to separate it from
all others will include within its limits all hitherto disco-
vered mammalian remains. No forms more transitional, or
approaching nearer to any other class, or even, as we shall
see, so near as do the Monotremes, occur in the records
of palaeontology. Of course our evidence on the subject

is only negative, and as such has little real value. The
first appearance, of which we are at present informed, of
mammals upon the earth, was early in the Mesozoic
period,-in the epoch called Triassic. At that time the
other classes of Vertebrata, except, perhaps, birds (but
our evidence here is defective), had long been well
established and distinctly defined. Indications of mam-
malian life occur in various formations, at different ages,
and at scattered points upon the earth's surface, through-
out the Mesozoic ages, but during its later stages are
entirely lost. These indications, though very frag-
mentary, all show animals of minute proportions, and for
the class to which they belong, rather low organisation.
With the commencement of the Tertiary period, however,
a total change takes place. Wherever the great Cretaceous
ocean bottoms have been elevated so as to become the fit
habitation of terrestrial animals, there mammals of varied
size, form, and function have been found to dwell, and
have left their remains, and from henceforth to the pre-
sent lime there is abundance of evidence of their con-
tinuous occupation of the earth's surface. The total
absence of all marine mammals in the Cretaceous epoch,
the fauna of which is, on the whole, so well preserved,
and the absence of land mammals in the Wealden, are
facts, which though difficult to account for, must not be

overlooked.
Before proceeding to the consideration of the history of
the special groups of Mammalia, attention may be called
to a few points of general interest relating to the whole
class, in which palacontological researches appear to have
shown some evidence of gradual modification or progres-
sion as time advanced. The first is a small point, as it
relates only to one family of animals, but it affords a good
illustration of the parallelism which has been observed
between the development of the race and that of the indi-
vidual. The earliest known forms of deer, those of the
Lower Miocene, as remarked by Gaudry, have no antlers,
as the young of the existing species. The deer of the
Middle Miocene have simple antlers, with not more than
two branches, as in existing deer in the second year. In
the Upper Miocene, species occur with three branches to
the antlers, but it is not until the Upper Pliocene and
Pleistocene times, that deer occur with antlers deve-
loped with that luxuriance of growth and beauty of form,
characteristic of some of the existing species in the
perfectly adult state. Next, the teeth in the greater

transverse rows. The liver of Avahis is represented
without any gall-bladder (it may be embedded), this
viscus being large, and having, as in the typical lemurs,
its fundus reversed from its ordinary position, and buried
in the hepatic issue in the two other genera. The cau-
date lobe of the liver is absent, and the spigelian is of fair
size. These points, it may be mentioned, have been pre-
viously recorded by Prof. Flower in his Hunterian Lec-
tures before the College of Surgeons in 1872, on the
visceral anatomy of the Mammalia. In Propithccus the left
subclavian artery is shown to be given off from the
innominate trunk, whence spring the three other main
anterior vessels, whilst in Avahis and Indris it springs
independently from the aorta. As in the other Lemurs
and the Swine, the mesenteric arteries run straight to the
walls of the viscera they supply, and do not form loops
just before they reach them; they anastomose freely at
their origins.

Whether or not this method of expressing the dentition
is correct is a matter of uncertainty, it depending on the
nature of the outer lower cutting teeth of the typical
Lemurs. We cannot, with many zoologists, help retain-
ing the opinion that the outer lower incisor-like teeth of
Lemur and its nearest allies are canines, and they most
certainly represent the outer pair in Indris, in which they
are larger than the inner. The presence of a third lower
milk molar confirms the opinion expressed by Prof.
Huxley1 in his memoir on the Angwrmtibo {Arctoccbus
calabarensis), that in the adult Indrisina; it is a premolar
which is missing in each semi-jaw.
M. Milne-Edwards gives elaborate measurements

SCIENCE AND ART IN IRELAND
AN important announcement as to the proposed action
of the Government with regard to the various scien-
tific institutions in Dublin is contained in the following
article, which we reprint from the Times of Tuesday last:—
The subject of the administration of Science and Art
in Ireland in connection with increased State aid has now
been under discussion at different times for many years.
It must not be imagined, however, that Ireland is not
already provided with numerous institutions for the pro-
motion of Science and Art, or that it lacks grants for that
purpose. In Dublin alone there are under the manage-
ment of the Royal Dublin Society, which is a chartered
body, a Museum of Natural History, Botanic Gardens
(with Botanical Museum), and a library. Next comes a
purely national institution, the Royal College of Science,
with its small industrial collections and the geological

Acting upon this and other considerations, to which we
need not further allude, the Commission unanimously
came to the conclusion that the remedy they were seeking
lay, not in the formation of a separate Department for
Ireland—which, indeed, they went on to say would be
detrimental to the interests of Science and Art in that
country—but in the consolidation and better administra-
tion of the existing institutions, and in the filling up of
some obvious gaps. The essence of their recommenda-
tions was the amalgamation of several of the collections
into an institution strongly resembling the South Ken-
sington Museum, but covering a wider field, which should
be administered by a director, who should be in imme-
diate relation not only with the Minister of Education,
but also with the Irish Government. This scheme, how-
ever, had a great drawback in the eyes of many of the
leading noblemen and gentlemen in Ireland who were
interested in the existing institutions, because it entailed
the deprivation in the case of the two principal societies
—the Royal Dublin Society and the Royal Irish Academy
—of the privileges they had hitherto enjoyed of adminis-

tering large public funds voted for the Natural History
Museum and the Botanic Gardens, as well as other insti-
tutions. This objection and, possibly, the economical
views of the late Government, have sufficed to keep this
question in abeyance since 1S68; but it now appears that
the present Government have determined to take some
decided step, for they have, "we understand, during the
last few days communicated with the bodies principally
interested in the scheme.
From the information which has reached us we gather
that the plan now proposed is as complete as that indi-
cated by the Commission of 1868, although it is not
identical with it. Thus it has been decided to build a
Science and Art Museum for Ireland similar to that now
existing in Edinburgh. This will occupy a site adjacent
to the principal buildings which now exist, and will con-
sist of collections analogous to those of the South Ken-
sington Museum, to which will be added the antiquarian
collection of the Royal Irish Academy, and the industrial
collection of the old Museum of Irish Industry. The
building will also provide space for the Natural History
Museum and Geological Collection, and will thus set free
the present Natural History Museum, to which the library
of the Royal Dublin Society will be transferred and formed
into a public National Library.

As may be imagined, this comprehensive scheme will
entail the expenditure of a large amount of public money,
and the Government make the offer contingent on the
surrender of the privileges to which we have before
referred, and the vesting of all the property in the Govern-
ment. With the view, however, of still enabling those
who at present take so great an interest in the existing
institutions to continue this useful co-operation and repre-
sent the special wants of the country, it is proposed that
the new National Library shall be managed by a Council
of twelve trustees—eight to be nominated by the Royal
Dublin Society and four by the Government; while the
administration of the Science and Art Museum, which is
to be under a director appointed by the Crown, as in Scot-
land, will be controlled by a Board of twelve visitors—
four nominated by the Lord Lieutenant; five by the
Royal Dublin Society; and three by the Royal Irish
Academy.
It is not proposed to interfere with the functions of the
societies we have named, and we are glad to see that the

yards. Watersheds bounding contiguous basins, gently
sloping plains, deeper valleys, steeply cut ravines may
be recognised according as the rock varies here and there
in more or less of cohesiveness.
The slight inequalities in this respect give rise to many
other details worth noticing. On the vertical surface of
the cliffs the rock is etched in a manner scarcely per-
ceptible unless the sun shines obliquely on its surface. In
this way a rock apparently homogeneous is seen to have
been originally built up of layers deposited at the most
various angles in the manner characteristic of what is
called false bedding.
Here and there an undisturbed talus at the foot of a cliff
has been permeated by water carrying some cementing ma-
terial which feebly binds together again the incoherent sand.
The base gets washed or blown away, and the surface of
the talus is seamed with miniature landslips leaving steep
and precipitous cliffs of the frightful height of at least
two to three inches. These precipices are scored and
columned with the sharpest fluting as they have been

Here and there again the rock is traversed horizontally
by layers, in which the cementing material is ferruginous.
When the rock is denuded down to this it first gets
washed pretty bare and then broken up into angular
fragments by the frost. Each of these fragments pro-
tects the rock beneath, and so gradually gets mounted
upon a little pedestal like the perched blocks of a Swiss
glacier or the mud columns in the valley of Visp (Fig. 2,

PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS
'X'HE struggle which Physical Science has had to
¦*• obtain a footing amongst the regular subjects of the
school curriculum has not been altogether in vain, and
the study of science now occupies a conspicuous place in
the prospectus, at any rate, of many of our schools. But
to those who, being behind the scenes, are acquainted
with the real facts, the position which science occupies
amongst other subjects, with a few honourable exceptions,
is insignificant in the extreme. It is admitted as an axiom
by all science teachers, that if the study of science is to be
of any value, the student must, in some part at least of his
work, be brought face to face with the facts of nature, and
that unless this be the case the introduction of the sub-
ject into the school course is worse than useless ; but how
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
commonly does the so-called science-work of a school
consist simply in the acquisition of so much "useful
knowledge?" And even when in other respects the teach-
ing is fairly satisfactory, the practical work is too often
optional—an "extra," or taken on half-holidays, and so
ruined by the competition of cricket and football.
We believe that a fair standard by which to judge of the
present position of the study of science in schools is to
be found in the "Regulations of the Oxford and Cam-
bridge Schools Examination Board," and in the papers
set at the examination for certificates (the first held) of
July 1874. Certificates are awarded to those who succeed
in passing in a certain number of subjects ; and the pos-
session of such a certificate should indicate that a boy
has obtained a thorough education up to the point fairly
to be expected on leaving school
Regulation 7 provides that "the examination for cer-
tificates shall include the following subjects :—
"Group I.—(1) Latin; (2) Greek; (3) French and
German.
"Group II.—(1) Mathematics (Elementary) ; (2) Ma-

Compare with this the extent of knowledge expected
in other subjects. French and German, for example,
together form one subject: to succeed, the candidate
must be proficient in dictation in each language; trans-
lation from unseen authors; the grammar, history, and
etymology of the languages; translation from English
into French and German, besides translation from books
appointed. For the last examination, books which might
be chosen were—in French, Pascal's " Provincial Letters;"
in German, Goethe's "Faust" and " Italianische Reise."
The relative value attached to different branches of
science is also worthy of remark. Chemistry, for ex-
ample, is supposed to be so far inferior to Botany as an
educational study, that the slight subject of Heat is added
as a make-weight.
It is really hard to- determine whether the compilers of
these Regulations (the head-masters of one or two of our
most important schools being amongst them, if report
errs not) have acted simply in ignorance of what physical
science in a school ought to be, or whether this is an inge-
nious device to strangle science as a school study, and to

IT was decided at a Convocation held at Oxford on
Tuesday that an inducement should be offered to Prof.
Max Miiller to continue to honour Oxford by remaining

been a disgrace had no effort been made to retain the

who should receive one-half of the salary of the present

makeshift; time was of importance, and the proper course,
by statute, because lengthy, was not available. Vienna had

some young man to make out his claim to the Professor-

more liberal, but, in fact, the University had come to the
end of its tether. The Dean then dwelt on the high
value of the Professor's services. He told how Mr. Max
Miiller had " audaciously " projected, when but a youth
and a pupil of Burnouf, an edition of the Rigveda. For
this he was forced to come to England, for which purpose

true dog-tracks are farmed, and the boat, which requires only a
moderate depth of water, is kept afloat at a sufficient distance
from the bank by the rudder, which is managed by a person
sitting in the stern of the boat. The boats are often hollowed
out of a single tree stem, and may be notwithstanding, thanks to
the dimensions the trees attain in these regions, of very beautiful
form and very large. The dogs have a strong resemblance to
the Eskimo dogs in Greenland, which are also employed as
draught animals, which may perhaps be considered a proof that
the same climatic circumstances and a similar method of employ-
ing a species of animals create like races. Most of the natives
who come into intimate contact with the Russians at the present
time, we are informed, profess Christianity. That many heathen
customs still, however, cleave to them is shown by the following
incident. At a "simovie " where we landed for some hours on
Sept. 16, we as usual came upon a burying-place in the wood
near the dwelling-houses. The corpses were laid in large coffins
above ground, with a cross in nearly every case raised over them.
Ac one of the graves there was a consecrated picture fixed to the
cross, which must be considered an additional proof that a
Christian reposed in the coffin. Notwithstanding this, several

garments, which had belonged to the deceased, were found hang-
ing on a bush near the grave, together with a bundle containing
food, principally dried fish. At the graves of the richer natives
we are informed that the survivors place, together with food,
some rouble notes, in order that the departed may not be alto-
gether destitute of ready money on his entrance into the other
world. But that fine clothes are not considered any special
recommendation with St. Peter was evidenced by the exceedingly
shabby, tattered, and patched condition of the garments hung up
at the grave in question.
Hitherto we had during our journey from Dudino up the
Jenisei for the most patt very fine, often warm, autumn weather.
The first frost occurred south of Saostrovskoi on the night before
Sept. 20, and from that date the temperature of the nights was
generally under the freezing point. The days, however, con-
tinued to be warm and fine. The fall of rain was slight.
On the 20th we anchored at the mouth of one of the largest
tributaries which fall into Jenisei from the east, viz., Podkam-
mennaja Tunguska. Immediately below a welcome opportunity
offered of taking soundings right across the river, which is here
over a kilometre broad. A little distance from the western bank
the lead showed four fathoms, afterwards the depth again dimi-
nished to 24 fathoms, but afterwards increased anew to seven
fathoms. At a number of olher places also soundings were
taken, which are believed to confirm the statement of the pilots
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
that the depth of the river as far up as Jeniseisk is sufficient even
for large vessels. However, in order to establish this with
complete certainty, and to discover the most convenient channel
for navigation, much more complete hydrographical surveys are
required than those which we had an opportunity of making in
passing.
As I have already mentioned, productive potato land and
cabbage plots are to be found at the Skoptists' Colony, north of
the Arctic circle, and the farther south we came, the more such
patches of cultivation increased in size. No proper cultivation
of grain is met with until we reach Sykobafka, situated in lat.
60°, but in the future it is quite certain that when the woois and
morasses are diminished, a profitable agriculture may be car-
ried on much farther north. Already from this point to the
southern boundary of Siberia, or more correctly to the steppe
lands of Central Asia, we have at most places more than 100
Swedish miles (1,000 kilometres), and if we consider that a belt
of land of this breadth, for the most part covered with excellent,
easily cultivated soil, extends right across the whole of Asia from
Ural to the Pacific Ocean, we may form an idea of the immeasur-

in our country, and as the most of them cannot without too great
a sacrifice undertake year-long labours more or less foreign to
their proper employment, I have made an application to the
Government for a grant of 10,000 crowns (about 550/.) to defray
the expense of working up the collections. If this application
be granted, and the collections of the expedition of 1875 tnus be-

merly almost unknown, will soon be reckoned among those of

practical questions, and I shall therefore, as they are concluded,

ON THE SPECTRUM OF NITROGEN AND
THAT OF ALKALINE METALS IN GEISS-
LER TUBES, BY M. SALET
T N 1872 Mr. Schuster published the important statement that
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:52 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
"nitrogen, heated in a Geissler tube with metallic sodium,
ceased to give the characteristic channelled spectrum." He de-
scribed the bright lines he got in this case, and attributed them
to pure nitrogen, considering the band spectrum to be that of an
oxide of nitrogen, a compound destroyed by the alkaline metal.
These conclusions were afterwards disputed, for, in repetition of
the experiments, the channelled spectra were seen to disappear
after action of the sodium, but they were replaced by various
spectra, none of which belonged to nitrogen; so that, after its
purification, this gas could not be detected by prismatic analysis.
The chemical compound really formed by the action of oxygen
on nitrogen is (as M. Salet pointed out) peroxide of nitrogen, a
very stable substance, whose spectrum does not coincide with
that, the appearance of which is to be explained.
In a recent note to the French Academy, M. Salet affirms
(1) that the channelled spectrum may be produced with nitro-
gen heated in contact with sodium; (2) that the disappearance
of the nitrogen spectrum is due to that of the nitrogen itself,
which is entirely absorbed by the sodium under the influence of
the electric discharge; (3) that the spectrum described by Mr.
Schuster may probably be attributed to vapours of the alkaline
metal.
I Ie describes some of his more decisive experiments. A closed
tube of hard glass was procured, 12 cm. long and 2 cm. in diameter;
at one end were introduced two aluminium electrodes, about
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
1 cm. apart; to the other end was soldered a tubulure with an
enlarged part, into which was put a small piece of sodium, then
the tubulure soldered to the mercury pump. A vacuum having
been made, the sodium was heated; it swelled and boiled,
parting with hydrogen; the swelling at length ceased, and at a
higher temperature the sodium was slowly volatilised. Then the
apparatus was separated from the pump, with the blowpipe;
and the bright liquid and globule of sodium was brought
into the tube. After cooling, the enlarged part was sepa-
rated, and the tube directly fused on to the pump. Then
exhaustion was recommenced, and the sodium volatilised, care
being taken that the condensation of the metallic vapour occurred
only in the half of the tube not holding the electrodes; and nitro-
gen, pure and dry, was then admitted. A vacuum was produced
anew three times with the nitrogen, the alkaline metal being
volatilised each time. Lastly, the apparatus was closed, having
a pressure of about 5 mm. It was now possible to fuse the
globules, unite them, and volatilise them afresh a dozen times in
contact with the same mass of gas, without the appearance of
the spark between the electrodes being in the least degree modi-
fied. The Holtz machine was used, or an induction coil with a

the Government "Universities" Bill would constitute an Exe-
cutive Commission with powers to receive schemes from Col-
leges, and base upon them the new University and Collegiate
organisation. We shall deal at length with this important sub-
ject at the proper time.
We hear a rumour—which we think not unlikely to strengthen

tions may be most worthy of being exhibited. It especially calls
their attention to instruments of an historic character, and to
those which have been constructed and principally applied in
Italy. In the case of important instrument--, of which the use
cannot be dispensed with for the length of time the Exhibition
may remain open, or which are of too fragile or too delicate a
description to incur the risk of transport, but which, from their
novelty or perfection, merit being brought before the notice of
scientific men through this Exhibition, the Committee request
that models and photographs of not too small a size may be sent.
These models and photographs are to be made at the expense of
the institution or persons exhibiting, but in cises where they may
not be able to support the expense, the Committee, in propor-
tion to the importance of the instruments, will supply the means
from a fund set apart for the purpose by the Minister of Public
Instruction. The Committee suggest that especial regard should
be had to the quality and interest of the objects sent, rather than
to the quantity.
A SUPPOSED error in the determination of the date when
Easter Sunday should fall in the present year has been made
the subject of communications to various metropolitan and pro-
vincial journals. We shall enter more fully into this question
next week; meanwhile it may be stated that the presumed error
is an imaginary one, according to the strict methods for ascer-
taining the date of Easter Sunday, which is correctly fixed by

A Ci MMITTEE has been formed at the Hague for the purpose
of organising a movement to erect a statue in that city to
Spinoza, the 200th anniversary of whose death occurs this
month next year. Foreign committees have also been formed,
and among the members of the English committee are Professors
Bain, Huxley, Jowett, Max Midler, Tyndall, Principal Tulloch,
Messrs. G. II. Lewes and Herbett Spencer. Committees have
also been formed in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the United
States, Finland, France, Italy, and Switzerland. We do not
require to say anything in favour of this movement; now that
the matter has been mooted it seems surprising that nothing
of this kind has hitherto been done to honour the memory of one
of the greatest, purest, and most cosmopolitan of philosophers.
The movement only requires to be widely known to meet with
adequate practical support; many who may differ seriously from
Spinoza's philosophy will be glad of an opportunity to show
their appreciation of a great, courageous, and disinterested
thinker. The treasurer is Mr. A. W. Jacobson, the Hague, the
president being Dr. M. F. A. G. Campbell, of the same place.

examination of the United States weather maps and from other
sources. Among the points observed are: that periods of un-
usual cold are generally accompanied by descent of air from the
upper regions of the atmosphere, and they are almost quite inde-
pendent of direction of the wind ; that both in summer and
winter the force of vapour in Philadelphia is greatest with the
wind which brings the highest temperature, and conversely;
that the rainfall there shows a diurnal maximum about 6 p.m.
and a minimum about 3 A.M. ; that in the northern hemisphere

latitude 6o", and perhaps somewhat further; and that storms
travel with less velocity over the Atlantic (i9'6 miles an
hour) than over the continents of America and Europe (26
miles an hour). The author compares storm-paths in America
and Europe.—Mr. Rowland continues his "Studies on Magnetic
Distribution," and one result he arrives at is, that hardening is
most useful for short magnets; in very long bars it does not
increase the total quantity of magnetism, but only changes the
distribution. It would seem that almost the only use in harden,
ing magnets at all is to concentrate the magnetism and reduce
the weight.—This paper is followed by a useful summary and
comparison of recent researches on Sound by Tyndall, Henry,
and Duane.—Prof. Draper endeavours to determine the correc-
tion to be applied for effect of temperature on the power of
solutions of quinine to rotate polarised light. The presence of
sulphuric acid changes the rotation power of the alkaloid by
1000. Quinine used to be given in the form of sulphuric acid
solution, and in the recently more popular form of pills or the
like, its action is much less, and less certain; this difference
being doubtless due to the change of molecular arrangement
which is revealed in action of sulphate solutions of the alkaloid
on light.—Mr. Allen has a note on extinct wolf and deer species

of magnetic induction, M. Chwolson deals with a phenomenon
in production of the magnetic state by external magnetising force,
with which theory has seemed to be in discordance. This is the
fact, that K, the so-called magnetisation number (or the ratio of
magnetic movement produced to the magnetising force), in the
case of small increasing forces, increases at the beginning,
reaches a maximum, and with further increase of the force,
becomes continuously smaller. This initial increase of K seemed
to contradict the theory of molecular magnets capable of being
turned round. M. Chwolson's object is to show that it not only
does not contradict it, but is directly deducible from it, and he
arrives at this result from a closer study of the processes which,
according to Weber's fundamental hypothesis, must occur in a
magnetised body, and from a simple assumption as to the origin
of molecule-repelling force.—There are three (largely mathe-

river Stry westward. On the whole 250 Austrian square miles
have been mapped. Many other researches were carried on in
almost all parts of the Empire. Among these are the follow-
ing :—M. Stur examined the coal-mines of Bohemia, Moravia,
and Silesia, for the purpose of making a detailed classification of
their strata. By means of a grant that he obtained from the
Urban-Schltinbach legacy, he was enabled to investigate and
compare the large phyto-pala;ontological collections in Dresden,
Halle, Berlin, and Breslau. -Moreover, he visited chiefly on be-
half of the museum of the Geological Society, some of the most
important beds of Lias and Jura fossils in Salzburg and the
Salz-Kamergut. The Ministry of Commerce, intending to
establish a special school for workers in stone, commissioned the
vice-director, M. F. Fotterle, to examine such rocks near Pre-
dazzo as might be used for technical purposes; this he did, and
the school was opened on December 15, 1875. At the request of
the same Ministry, M. II. Wolf made geological researches along
the line of some railroads, and M. G. A. Koch along the recently

REPORT OF THE VIVISECTION COMMISSION
NO one who examines this voluminous Report of the
Commission appointed some months ago to inquire
into "the practice of subjecting live animals to experi-
ments for scientific purposes," can deny that the Commis-
sioners have done their work thoroughly, as they have
done it without delay. The Commissioners evidently
entered upon their important inquiry with the determina-
tion of discovering the whole truth as to the practice of
vivisection, and of eliciting the opinions and reasons not
only of its advocates but of its most determined opponents.
A mere glance at the long list of names of the witnesses will
serve to assure anyone that the evidence which has been
obtained is the expression of the most weighty and trust-
worthy opinion on both sides, and both the advocates
and opponents of the practice must feel relieved that the
Commission was appointed and has done its work: the
former will be glad that the true condition of things is
now before the public, that the worst, so to speak, is
known, and the latter that they now know definitely what

they have to contend against.
The bulk of the blue-book is of course occupied by the
evidence. Prefixed to this is the Report and recommen-
dations of the Commissioners, and in the Appendices are
contained various documents which throw light upon the
inquiry and enable the reader to learn exactly what has
been done in the matter up to the present time, and what
will be the starting-point of Parliament in discussing the
Report. We need do little more here than lay the Com-
missioners' recommendations before our readers. In their
Report they candidly discuss the varied methods and uses
of experimenting on living animals, the bearings of the evi-
dence elicited during the inquiry, as well as every possible
suggestion as to what legislative action ought to be taken
in reference to the matter. As might be expected from the
character of the men who compose the Commission, every
point of importance is brought prominently out, the
subject is looked at all round, and from every point of
view. Their recommendations, therefore, which they
give after briefly referring to the two Bills of last session,
will without doubt have great weight with all who take an
interest in the matter. They are as follows :—
"What we should humbly recommend to Your Majesty
would be the enactment of a law by which experiments
upon living animals, whether for original research or for

demonstration, should be placed under the control of the
Secretary of State, who should have power to grant
licences to persons, and, when satisfied of the propriety
of doing so, to withdraw them. No other persons should
be permitted to perform experiments. The holders of
licences should be bound by conditions, and breach of the
conditions should entail the liability to forfeiture of the
licence; the object of the conditions should be to ensure
that suffering should never be inflicted in any case in which
it could be avoided, and should be reduced to a minimum
where itcould not be altogether avoided. This should be the
general scope of the conditions ; but their detailed applica-
tion should be left to be modified from time to time by the
minister responsible according to the dictates of experi-
ence. In the administration of the system generally, the
responsible minister would of course be guided by the
opinion of advisers of competent knowledge and experi-

assured that this claim shall not be forgotten amid the
triumphs of advancing science."
The recommendations, we are confident, will meet with
the approval of all moderate persons on both sides.
Indeed, some may b^ inclined to think that Science has
made too great concessions to popular feeling; that she
has made concessions all who take the trouble to read the
Report and evidence will alio k. The reasonable opponents
of vivisection will no doubt also be prepared to make
concessions, as they must admit that, after the evidence
adduced in this inquiry, its uncompromising suppression
would be a calamity to humanity; and they must also
admit that the outcry of " cruelty to animals'' has had
a very slender justification. We hope the Report
will speedily be brought before Parliament, and the re-
commendations essentially adopted, so that both for the
credit of science and for the satisfaction of popular feeling
the prac'.ice may be carried on under well-defined and
universally understood regulations.

rT"'HE late Sir Charles Lytll used to relate how, on the
J- occasion of a visit which he paid to M. Deslong-
champs at Caen, the eminent French palaeontologist rose
from the piles of books amid which he was working, and
exclaimed, with a sigh of relief, "Let us devoutly thank
Heaven that our lot is not cast with the next generation of
geological workers !—for how they will manage to grapple
with the ever-increasing literature of the science I am at
a loss to conceive." The difficulty which Deslongchamps
thus playfully anticipated is now a present and pressing
one, which, it is not too much to assert, is almost painfully
felt by every scientific student and worker. While, on the
one hand, it is absolutely impossible that any man can
read even thing that issues from the press relating even
to his own department of science, jet, on the other, no
one can afford to neglect the results which are being
obtained by his contemporaries. It is sad to remember
that a large part of the energy of the illustrious Dalton
was wasted—owing to his not being able to make himself
acquainted with what other chemists of his day were
accomplishing—in solving problems which had been

already completely disposed of. And we are persuaded
that the painful questions of priority in discovery which
frequently arise between the workers in the same branch
of science ought to be referred, not to the existence of
petty jealousies or of a disposition to take unworthy
advantages, but to the difficulty which each investigator
finds in consulting the latest published results of his
fellow-workers in the same paths of inquiry.
So far as relates to the scientific memoirs of past years,
the Royal Society has conferred an inestimable boon on
the labourers in every department of science by the pub-
lication of its admirable '• Catalogue," for the appearance
of the first supplement to which we are now anxiously
looking forward. Aided by a grant from the British
Association, too, the " Zoological Record" gives a yearly
summary of the work which is being accomplished in that
department of science. It has long been felt as a serious
and yearly increasing want—though one which has been
already to some extent met by publications in France, Ger-
many, and Switzerland—that no similar work of reference
for the geological sciences has hitherto appeared in this

attained by this, the first volume of the "Geological

increasing activity of our great scientific societies, the
continual formation of new local associations and field-
clubs (whe'.her connected with particular districts or with
our Universities and public schools), most of which pub-
lish their own transactions, to show the difficulty of

cations which appear yearly in the British Islands alone.
But when we add to these the prolific publications of the
different State surveys and the numerous scientific insti-
tutions of the United States and of oar own colonies and
dependencies; when we bear in mind the scientific acti-
vity exhibited by the French, German, and Italian speak-
ing populations of Europe, and the books and journals
written in languages, which of course few scientific men
are able to read, such as the Russian, Danish, Dutch,
Scandinavian, Hungarian, Bohemian, Serbian, &c. ; E.nd
when we recollect that geological memoirs are published
even in Japan and Tahiti !—we may have some idea of the
magnitude and difficulty of the task with which the con-
ductors of the " Geological Record" have to grapple.
In illustration of the energy which has been brought to
bear upon this task, we may mention that the first volume
of the " Geological Record " extends to nearly 400 pages;
that the journals of which the contents, so far as they
relate to geology, have been given in abstract, number
nearly 200; and that the separate entries of books,
memoirs, and maps exceed 2,000.

tific library; and in congratulating the editor on the

manner in which he has surmounted the first and greatest
difficulties of his arduous undertaking, we find only one
cause for complaint. So far as the title-page shows, no
arrangements have been made with agents residing
abroad for the circulation of the work in America, the
colonies, and on the Continent. We are persuaded, so
very general is the use of the English language among
the scientific men of all parts of the world, that so soon
as this omission is remedied, the foreign circulation of
the "Geological Record" will equal or even exceed that
which it already has at home; while most valuable aid
will be given in the preparation of the future volumes of
the work by the secretaries of foreign societies and the
editors of Continental and American journals sending
copies of their publications, immediately that they appear,
to the conductors of this important work of reference.

Radiometers and Radiometers
I have recently been trying some experiments with a radio-
meter, obtained from Mr. Browning, and as some of my results
are different from what I was led to anticipate, I should
like to know whether there is anything special in my particular
instrument, or whether other people have noticed the same
things.
In Mr. Crookes' paper on "The Mechanical Action of Light,"
Quarterly Journal of Science, No. xlvii. p. 348, he states that
"when only dark heat is allowed to fall on the arms [of the
radiometer], as from a vessel of boiling water, no rotation what-
ever is produced" (The italics are miuc.)
Now I find that my radiometer is particularly sensitive to
dark heat, the presence of a heated copper wire, or still more
that of an iron poker when only slightly warmed, instantly
accelerating the number of revolutions.
But more than this: when exposed in a room to diffused day-
light, the velocity of rotation is greatly influenced by the tempe-
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
rature of the room, and is by no means an indicator of the
amount of light only.
One morning this week during the frost, upon looking at my
radiometer, it appeared to be motionless, although standing not
far from my study window. When placed nearer to the light it
revolved, but so slowly that I thought the instrument must have
received an injury. The room at the time was very cold, as the
lire had not been lighted. After the fire had been lighted and
the temperature of the room raised, the velocity of rotation
increased, and upon observing the instrument just before dark,
whe.i the room was very warm, the rotation was considerably
greater than it had been in the window in the middle of the
day, although at the time there was only just enough light in the
room to enable me to see the instrument at all. When I brought
the radiometer near to the fire, which consisted only of dull
hardly glowing coals, the rotation of the arms became so rapid
as to render them almost invisible.
Upon taking the instrument out of doors between five and six
o'clock in the afterno >n, the thermometer a few degrees below
freezing-point, the arms revolved slowly from right to left as
usual, but upon bringing it near to a mass of snow, and shading

satisfactory velocity. Its subsequent sailing flight until it again
increases its rate of .speed by flapping, I would suggest to be
merely a utilisation of this original vis viva to the utmost possible
advantage, the ascending and descending movements of the bird
being nothing more than a change from actual to potential energy,
and vice versd. Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that the wind
is dead ahead,and that the bird commences sailinghorizontally with
a certain vis viva. With this, by fixing its wings so as to present
inclined planes to the direction of the wind, it is able to rise
to a certain height, the velocity decreasing in some ratio to the
ascent, and if the highest point capable of being reached is
attained, the bird for the instant comes to rest; up to this
moment the actual energy has been gradually changing into
potential, and the bird gaining thereby a position of advantage.
It is, however, extremely rare thit this position is attained —
most frequently the horizontal velocity is only partially destroyed.
The planes of the wings being now changed with reference to
the direction of the wind, the bird begins to descend; the
potential energy is transformed into actual, and velocity is
acquired, to be again changed into potential, and so on until it
becomes necessary to renew it. The line of flight, therefore, of

an albatross going directly against the wind consists of a series
of undulations, the summits of which correspond to the instants
of least relative velocities, or positions of greatest potential
advantage ; whilst the lowest points correspond to the instants
of greatest relative velocity and least potential advantage.
During all this time vis viva is of course being extracted by
the resisiance of the wind, and the velocity after a while is so
diminished that the bird loses its power of rising to a satisfac-
tory position of advantage. It is then that flapping rec:m-
mences and new power of flight is acquired. When it is re-
membered that the weight of a Cape albatross varies from
16 lb. to 20 lb., and the stretch of wings from 10 to 12 feet, it
will be evident how great is the potential energy of such a bird
at the height say of 100 feet, and also how complete is its power
of utilising that energy. The question may be asked, how long
will it be before 2,000 loot-pounds of work have been extracted
by air moving at the rate of sixty miles an hour? for until it has
been extracted, or nearly so, the sailing flight of the albatross
need not cease. By means of a suitable mechanism for changing
the inclination of the wing planes every few seconds, the sailing
of the albatross, I believe, might be simulated without great
difficulty. It is generally supposed that the stronger the wind
tbe greater is the power of sailing-flight. In the special instance
referred to, viz., that of sailing directly in the teeth of the wind,
this is not the case. A good breeze is evidently better than
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
either a very strong wind or a calm. In the one case, a too great
resistance destroys the vis viva too rapidly; in the other, the
bird suffers from a want of sufficient resistance, very much as a
kite does during a calm.
In sailing in any other direction a violent wind majt more or
less aid the flight, and the velocity attained in some instances be
enormous and very deceptive. It is this element, viz., the velocity
acquired by sailing obliquely with the wind, that is so difficult
for the eye to eliminate in estimating the actual power of the bird
to sail against the wind. In flying with the wind, the resisiance
to the stroke being greater, the necessary speed may be more
rapidly acquired and with fewer strokes, provided the bird has
the requisite strength. But, as might naturally be supposed, sail-
ing directly with the wind for any considerable distance is rarely
or never seen, the bird not finding sufficient resistance in the air
for its support.
From what has been said it will appear that the superior sailing
power of the albatross, in comparison with other birds, is due—
(1) To its ability to acquire readily very great vis viva by
means of its extremely powerful wings.
(2) To its almost peifect power of utilising this vis viva for

During the present session we have aided ourselves in Glasgow
with four very important helps to the teaching of the kire'.ic
S)stem of force-measurement. One is the improvement in

for the kinetic units of force. The British Association has Sanc-
tis ned the use of the name Dyne for the kinetic unit of force
founded on the centimetre, gramme, and second, as units of
length, mass, and time respec ively. Prof. James Thomson has
given the name Poundal for the British kinetic unit of force
founded on the foot, pound, and second. The third help is the
ccnstruclion by Prof. Thomson, for the first lime, so far as I
know, of spring balances for indicating poundals and kilodynes.

The Monotremata, represented only by the Orni-
thorhyncus and Echidna of Australia, the lowest and
most reptilian of mammals, seem to be the survi-
vors of a group of animals of intermediate structure
through which the passage from the lower to the
higher vertebrates was made. But of this palaeon-
tology has hitherto afforded not the slightest proof. Ex-
cept some Pleistocene remains of one of the existing
genera, no trace of any extinct animal allied to the
Monotremata, or showing any decidedly intermediate
characters between Mammals and the Sauropsida, has
ever been found. The earliest known remains of mam-
mals—in fact, all those of the Mesozoic period—appear to
belong to the Marsupialia, although too little is yet
known of their general organisation to pronounce defi-
nitely on their affinities. As early as the time of depo-
sition of the Purbeck beds, below the Wealden, two very
distinct t)pes of dentition prevailed, bearing some resem-
blance to those characterising the modern polyprotodont

were of a simple Palseotheroid type, and the incisors and
canines were very much reduced. Their fore feet had
four and the hind feet three short stout toes. These
animals which, according to the correct rules of nomen-
clature, should constitute the family Titanotherida, be-
came extinct, apparently without successors, in the Mio-
cene age.
In the Pliocene period, Rhinocerolida, in the form of
Aceratherium and Aphelops, were still abundant, though
towards the end of the period they became entirely
extinct. True rhinoceroses, like those of the Old World
with median horns, have never been met with in America.
Remains of tapirs are also found but sparingly, and a great
development took place in the various forms of three-toed
horses, Protohippus and Hipparion, which replaced the
Anchttherium of the Miocene. These in their turn gave
way to true horses, of which remains of several species
have been found in Pleistocene deposits, and scattered
throughout almost every region of the Continent from
north to south. These also became entirely extinct before

the discovery of America by the Spaniards, a most
remarkable circumstance when the fitness of the country
for their maintenance, proved by the facility with which
the descendants of horses introduced by the invaders
have multiplied in a feral state, is considered. The tapir,
in several modifications, still lingers in some districts of
South and Central America, the sole direct representative
of the vast and varied perissodactyle fauna of ages long
gone by.
The remains of Artiodactyles in the hitherto explored
American Eocenes are very scanty and unsatisfactory as
affording indications of their characters. Towards the
close of the period only do we find evidences of well-de-
fined selenodont (Agriochwrus) and bunodont {Elotherium
and Platygonus) forms. No species corresponding to
the European Anoplotherium, DicJtodon, or Xipodon, have
been discovered. During the Miocene period, however,
Artiodactyles of both types abounded in North America.
The selenodonts were chiefly represented by Oreodon,
and the allied earlier and more generalised Agriochwrus.
These were numerous in species and individuals, but they
became nearly extinct by the end of the Miocene, only
surviving in the form of Merychyus, the most modified
form of the group, into the Pliocene. The first indication
of the camel-like animals appears in this period in the

Pecora are now met with, allied somewhat to Traguhna,
as Leplomeryx, Hypisodus, and Hypertragulus, the latter
a very minute species, but no true deer, Bovida or even
Traguli, and no giraffes, Hclladothcria or Sivatheria.
The bunodonts were chiefly species of Elotherium, and
an allied four-toed form, Pelonax, remarkable for horn-
like lateral processes on its lower jaw, near the symphysis.
Peccary-like forms also are now met with. In the Plio-
cene or Pleistocene periods, except the somewhat pro-
blematical Cosoryx, founded on some branched horn
cores or antlers of a form perhaps allied to Antilo-
capra from the Niobrara Pliocene, all the animals can be
assigned to existing families. Of the Suina, all belong
to Dicotyhs, or Peccary (which had formerly a more
northern range than at present), or to the allied genus
Platygonus, no true Sus, or Phacochcerits, Babirussa,
or Hippopotamus, having been found. Thus the Ameri-

at the conclusion that the results obtained for the solar
and lunar actions did not exclude each other, but that
both sun and moon were concerned in the changes of the
earth's magnetic intensity ; and that possibly the varia-
tions in the character of the single oscillations were due
to the sun and moon sometimes acting in the same and
sometimes in opposite directions ; just as in the case of
the oceanic tides, for which the differences would be even
greater were the solar more nearly equal to the lunar
action.
This conclusion is put to the test; the mean variations
derived from the observations for each of two successive
years are calculated for periods of 26, of 27'3, and of 29/53
days, the two latter being the times of the lunar, tropical,
and synodical revolutions respectively. The variations
for each of these three periods corresponding to the posi-
tions of the moon and of a given solar meridian for each
day of the year are then added together; the sums should
represent the total actions of the two bodies for each day,
and if no other causes are in question, they should agree
with the observed variations.

I have shown that when the calculated results are pro-
jected so as to form a red curve, on the same mean line
as a black curve representing the observations, the two
agree very nearly with each other throughout the two
years. The different durations and ranges of single oscil-
lations, and the total disappearance of the latter in certain
months, are found to be produced, as was supposed, by
the greater or lesser agreement or opposition of the three
actions.
These results demonstrate, I think, not only that
the sun's rotation nnd the moon's revolutions produce
variations of the earth's magnetic force, but that all the
marked variations are really due to these causes.
There appears tc be one exception to the generality of
this conclusion, in sudden great changes, generally dimi-
nutions, of the earth's magnetism, which appear of variable
magnitude and apparently at irregular intervals. I
have examined these cases, and find that if a consider-
able diminution of intensity happen suddenly when a
given solar meridian is in the same plane with the earth,
that a similar sudden diminution generally occurs twenty-
six days or some multiple of twenty-six days after, when
the same solar meridian and the earth are again in the
same plane. In one case the sudden loss of force begins
five times in succession at the exact interval of twenty-six

days.
If we examine these cases of successive disturbance
when a given solar meridian arrives opposite the earth,
we are induced to conclude either that the solar action
exists only for this position, that is to say, that the earth
is its cause ; or that the action is continuous, but, unlike
light and heat, is propagated only in one direction (or
plane) ; or, which seems more probable, that the medium
through which these actions are transmitted proceeds
from the sun, is not uniformly distributed around it, nor
always distributed in the same way. This idea may aid
in explaining many facts in terrestrial magnetism for
which hitherto no clue has existed.
We arrive then at the conclusions that the variations
of the daily mean magnetic force are due to causes ex-
ternal to the earth, depending on the sun's and moon's
motions ; that all the principal variations of this force
can be calculated approximately for each day in twelve
months, on the hypothesis that the actions of these bodies
are constant throughout the year for the same positions
relative to the earth ; and that the great magnetic dis-

I fully concur with the writer (Mr. N. M. Watts) that
these Regulations and the two papers printed point to a
low standard of scientific knowledge in our great schools.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the Board does
not issue these Regulations as an ideal scheme of school
work, but merely intend them to answer the existing state
of the case. With the curriculum of any school they
have nothing to do, their function being to appoint
examiners to such schools as apply for them, leaving
the schools free, within reasonable limits, to choose their
subjects.
Now granting Mr. Watts' premises that certificates can
be obtained very cheaply by taking up two sciences
instead of Latin and Greek, this would give an impetus
to the study of those subjects in schools, resulting in a
large flock of scientific candidates.

quantitative determination of present or actual organic
impurity.
The past history of a water is made out chiefly through
the mineral products of oxidation which the polluting
organic matters have yielded, and which are still present
in the water. As these products are innocuous, it is
obvious that if all kinds of organic matter behaved alike
under the influence of oxidising agents, such evidence of
previous pollution might be safely disregarded; but it is
almost superfluous to point out that there are wide differ-
ences between various kinds of organic matter in regard
to the rapidity with which they combine with oxygen;
and of all kinds, that which is organised and living
opposes by far the greatest obstacles to oxidation.
Now the researches of Chauveau, Burdon Sanderson,
Klein, and others, scarcely leave room for doubt that the
specific poisons of the so-called zymotic diseases consist
of organised and living organic matter, and it is now cer-
tain that water is the medium through which some, at
least, of these diseases are propagated. It is evident,
therefore, that an amount of exposure to oxidising influ-

ences which may resolve the dead organic matters present
in water into innocuous mineral compounds, may, and
probably will, fail to affect those constituents which are
endowed with life, and Dr. Frankland adduced, as a
striking instance of the persistency of the typhoid poison
when diffused in water, the outbreak of a violent epidemic
of typhoid fever in a Swiss village through the use of
spring water, which, after contamination with the poison,
had filtered through nearly a mile of porous earth, but
which had nevertheless lost none of its virulent properties.
As the typhoid poison is always liable to be present in
sewage, and as there is no test for it, except its effects
upon man, the discovery of previous sewage contamina-
tion in potable water ought to be one of the chief objects
of the analyst.
The actual, or present, as distinguished from the
past, polluting organic matter of potable water can
only be ascertained from the amount of carbon and
nitrogen found as constituents of the organic matter
present in the water at the time when the analysis is
made. The method of performing this operation, known
to chemists as the "combustion" method, was fully de-
scribed to the Fellows of the Society by the speaker
eight years ago. Improvements since made were men-
tioned, and tie following proofs of the delicacy and

pare the quantities of organic carbon and organic nitrogen

Against these advantages the process of analjsis advo-
cated by the speaker involves more trouble and more
careful manipulation than are usually bestowed upon what
are called " commercial" analyses, and although these
drawbacks ought r.ot to be paramount considerations,
where such important issues are involved, yet if any other
more simple method existed from which trustworthy
quantitative information about the organic matter in water
could be obtained, the more troublesome process would
cease to have a raison d'ttre.
Such a simple alternative method of e'etermining organic
nitrogen, but not organic carbon, is now very extensively
used by chemists. It is known as the "albuminoid
ammonia " method, and depends upon the fact that, by
boiling with an alkaline solution of potassic perman-
ganate, most nitrogenous organic bodies are decomposed
with evolution of ammonia. From the amount of am-
monia so evolved, the proportion of organic nitrogen is
calculated. A critical examination of the results obtained
by this method conclusively demonstrates that it is in-
capable of converting into ammonia either the whole, or

of lines at equal intervals, like Nobert's bands or the
markings on Diatomaceat, it is possible so to manage the
illumination that the dark fringes of interference may
coincide with the true lines of structure, and give rise to
good definition, even beyond the normal limit, and also
agrees with the fact that lines less than unfyff&th of an
inch apart can be photographed, though seen with extreme
difficulty, if indeed truly resolved, except under very
peculiar and exceptional conditions; since the waves of
light at the blue end of the spectrum, which are concerned

of lines so near together that the interference fringes due
to the longer waves at the red end would give an indis-
tinct image. Taking everything into consideration, the
agreement between observation and the theory is so close
as to make it extremely probable, and to justify the con-
clusion that the normal limit of distinct visibility with the
most perfect microscope is J of the wave-length of the
light. If so, we must conclude that, even with the very
best lenses, except under special conditions, light itself is
of too coarse a nature to enable us to define objects less

tban «oiobth or 100000th of an inch aPart> according as
a dry or an immersion lens is used. We must also conclude
that, as far as this question is concerned, our microscopes
have already reached this limit, whatever improvements
may remain to be made in other respects.
2. The Size of the Ultimate Atoms of Matter.
After discussing the results obtained by Stoney,
Thompson, and Clerk-Maxwell, mainly derived from the
properties of gases, I come to the conclusion that in the
present state of our knowledge the best approximation
that we can make to the size of tly; ultimate atoms of
matter is the mean of their determinations. I adopt for
simplicity-n^jnth of an inch as the unit of length, and
1 oWn of an inch cube, or lc<joi?insTnTo"tn' of a cubic inch, as
the unit of volume. In the case of a true gas the number
of atoms in the length of t A^th of an inch at o° C, and a
pressure of one atmosphere, would be 21,770, and hence,
in mV&th of an inch cube, about 10,320,000,000,000.
If this gas were a mixture of two volumes of hydrogen
and one of oxygen, on combining to form water there
would be a contraction to ji, and on condensing into
liquid water a contraction to ^ of this; but since the
molecules of the resulting liquid would contain three
atoms of the gases, the total number of molecules of
liquid water in a given volume would be jj X 770 X J =
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
385 times the number of atoms of a gas. This gives for
the number of molecules of liquid water in nrVs'h of an
inch cube about 3,900,000,000,000,000.
As an illustration of a far more complex substance I
take albumen, and calculating as well as one can from its
chemical composition, and from the specific gravity of
horn, I come to the conclusion that the diameter of the
ultimate molecule of dry albumen is about 382 that of
the molecules of water, and that mVirth of an inch cube
would contain about 71,000,000,000,000.
If such be the case, we must conclude that in the
length of girikro'h of an inch (the smallest interval that
could be distinctly seen with the microscope) there would
be about 2.000 molecules of liquid water lying end to end,
or about 520 of albumen. Hence, in order to see the
ultimate constitution of organic bodies, it would be neces-
sary to use a magnifying power of from 500 to 2,000 times
greater than those we now possess. These, however, for
reasons already given, would be of no use unless the
waves of light were some Wmth part of the length they
are, and our eyes and instruments correspondingly per-

appears to me interesting to consider how far the theory
will hold good when examined from this more physical
point of view.
For the sake of argument, I assume that gemmules on
an average contain one million structural molecules of
albumen and molecularly combined water. Variations in
number, composition, and arrangement would then admit
of an almost infinite variety of characters. On this sup-
position it would require a thousand gemmules to be
massed together into a sphere, in order to form a speck
just distinctly visible with our highest and best magnify-
ing powers. By calculation I find that a single mamma-
lian spermatozoa might contain so many of such gem-
mules, that, if one were lost, destroyed, or fully developed
in each second, they would not be completely exhausted
until after the period of one month. Hence, since pro-
bably a number are concerned in producing perfect fertili-
sation, we can readily understand why the influence of
the male parent may be very marked, even after having
been, as regards particular characters, apparently dormant

In a similar manner I calculate that the germinal
vesicle of a mammalian ovum might contain enough
gemmules for one to be destroyed, lost, or fully developed
in each second, and yet the entire number not be ex-
hausted until after a period of seventeen years, and the
entire ovum might contain enough to last at the same rate
for no less than 5,600 years.
These calculations are made on the supposition that the
entire mass is composed of gemmules. Of this there is
little probability; but still, even if a considerable portion
of the ovum consists of completely formed material and
of mere nutritive matter, it might yet contain a sufficient
number of gemmules to explain all the facts contemplated
by the theory of pangenesis. The presence of any con-
siderable amount of such passive matter in spermatozoa
would, however, be a serious difficulty in the way of the
theory, unless indeed very many spermatozoa are in-
variably concerned in producing fertilisation.
Taking everything into consideration, it does not
appear to me that any serious objection can be raised
against pangenesis when examined from a purely physical
point of view, as far as relates to the inheritance of a very
complex variety of characters by the first generation,
though there would have been may serious difficulties to

contend with, if the ultimate atoms of matter had been
very much larger than is indicated by the properties of
gases.
When we come to apply similar reasonings to the
second or following generations, we are compelled, along
with Darwin, to conclude that gemmules have the power
of producing other gemmules more or less closely re-
sembling themselves, and of being collected together in
the sexual elements, since otherwise the number that
could be transmitted in a dormant state for several gene-
rations would be far too small to meet the requirements
of the case.
Conclusion.
In my remarks I have made no endeavour to conceal
our present ignorance of many very important questions
connected with my subject. Want of the requisite data
necessarily imparts a speculative character to many of
my conclusions; but perhaps there is no more fruitful
souice of knowledge than to see and feel how little is
accurately known, and how much remains to be learned.

The investigation into the cause of the explosion at the Jabin

An apparatus of great delicacy has lately been devised by Dr.

graph (as it is called) consists in enclosing a part of the body,
the fore-arm, e.g., in a glass cylinder with caoutchouc ring, filling

the cylinder with tepid water, and measuring, by a special appa-
ratus, the quantity of water which flows out or in through a tube
connected with the cylinder, as the arm expands or contracts.
An opening in the cylinder is connected by a piece of caoutchouc
tubing with a glass tube opening downwards into a test tube
suspended from a double pulley with counterpoise to which the
recording lever is attached, in a vessel containing a mixture of
alcohol and water. When the vessels of the arm dilate water
passes from the cylinder into the test tube, which is thereby im-
mersed further, so that the counterpoise rises; in the opposite
case water flows bick from the test-tube into the cylinder, the
test-tube rises, and the counterpoise descends. Among other
applications of the apparatus, Dr. Mosso employs it in studying
the physiology of thought and cerebral activity. The slightest
emotions arc revealed by the instrument by a change in the state
of the blood-vessels. The entrance of a person during the ex-
periment, in whom one is interested, has the effect of diminishing
the volume of the fore-arm fuur to fifteen cubic centimetres.

than nitrogen from the air. They have found that 1,000 litres
ol charcoal absorb 925 lit. of oxygen and only 750 lit. of nitrogen.
When moistened with water, 350 lit. of oxygen and 650 lit. of
nitrogen are given off; so that 575lit. of oxygen and 55lit. of
nitiogen remain, which may be extracted by means of the air
pump. By repeating the same process with this gaseous mixture,
they succeeded in obtaining oxygen in almost a pure state.
Whether this method was ever employed on an extensive scale
is unknown. But this has been the case with Mallet's' method,
founded on the higher coefficients of absorption of water for oxy-
gen, as compared with nitrogen. The coefficients of absorption of
these gases in water are 0025 for nitrogen, and C046 for oxygen.
Multiplied by their volumetric proportion in the atmosphere
079 and 0"2i, these figures yield the proportion in which
these gases occur in water = 00197 N and 00097 O; or, the air
akorlied in the water contains in one volume o 67 N, and C33
O. 1 f the non-absorbed nitrogen is now allowed to escape, and
the absorbed mixture of the two gases is extracted from the water
and submitted a second time to absorption, we shall find by
multiplying their coefficients with the numbers just obtained,
C67 (N) and C33 (O), that the mixture now absorbed will con-

tain o- 525 N and 0475 O. A third absorption will raise this
proportion to 0^375 N :0^625 O; a fourth to 025 N 1075 O; a
fifth to 0'I5 N : 0-85 O ; that is the same relation in which the
gases occur in the mixture ordinarily produced by Tessie du
Motay's process. After the eighth absorption, the gas evolved
is almost pure oxygen (0973 O and 0x127 N).
Mallet's apparatus consists of a greater or smaller number of
strong iron water-reservoirs, connected by forcing and sucking
pumps. Into the first air is pumped through fine openings, at
a pressure of about five atmospheres. After this the non-ab-
sorbed nitrogen is removed by opening a valve, and then by means
of the second forcing and sucking pump the absorbed gas is drawn
out of the first vessel and forced into the second. With four
vessels a complete operation is performed in five minutes. If
the vessels vary in size, decreasing from the first of iocb.m. to
the fourth of 5 cb.m. in capacity, uninterrupted working will
produce a result of 7,760 litres of a mixture containing 75 per
cent, of oxygen per hour; or, 168 cb.m. in twenty-four hours.
The cost of working and keeping this system in order is said to
be trifling, and a small amount ol superintendence will suffice if
the machine is made automatic. Where working power is
cheap, such as water power, or the lost heat of metallurgical
processes, these methods might possibly be of use, especially
for metallurgical processes themselves, which could be effectually
assisted by mixtures containing a smaller proportion of oxygen.

Summing up the practical results of this long list of inven-
tions, we find in the foremost rank the well-established method
of Tessie du Motay. The next place is taken by the mechanical
method of Mallet, just described; which, however, has not yet
met with a practical verification.
We arrive at last at the question, What uses has pure oxygen
hitherto served? As the supporter of combustion, we are
indebted to it for warmth and light; as a means of respiration,
it is the foundation of our lives.
Let us look at it then, from these three points of view. Its
metallurgical uses claim our first attention. The important part
it has performed in the history of platinum has been already
described. We have learned to do without it in lead soldering;
hydrogen or coal gas, burnt in air, supplying a sufficient quantity
of heat. The example of this industry encourages us to cherish
the greatest hopes for its further and wider employment. "Just
as gold," says an esteemed metallurgical chemist,¦ "while it was
still used in soldering platinum, destroyed its appearance by yellow
marks, in the same way white soft solder offends the eye when
applied to coloured metals. This unsightliness induced the

The cylinder is sold at one dollar per cubic foot (35 dols. per
cb.m.), including the oxygen it contains under ordinary pres-
sure ; the refilling with oxygen costs five cents per cubic foot
under the pressure of one atmosphere,1 a very high price, ex-
ceeding the calculation of Kuppelwieser more than twenty-two
times. Tessie du Motay tried to apply oxygen to the lighting
of streets and public places. The "Places" before the Tuilc-
ries and Hotel de Ville were at that time brilliant with light
given off from zirconium-cones under the influence of coal gas
and oxygen. The unsteadiness of the flame and its great cost
led him to prefer the carburatio 1 of hydrogen and of coal gas,
by passing the gases through a ve-sel of heavy hydrocarbons
fixed to every lamp before it entered the burner. In this way the
Boulevards were illuminated from the Rue Drouot to the Rue
Scribe with seventy oxygen burners. But this method was given
up, and the preparation of a very h avy gas instead of the usual
coal gas was at last resorted to, to be burnt by means of oxygen.
In this new form the visitor to the Vienna Kxhibition met with
it at the railway station, Kaiserin-Elizabeth-Wejtbahnhof. We
are permitted to extract the following description from an un-

Company, given before the Berlin Town Council:—
"The appearance of the grounds surrounding the Elizabeth
railway station, and of the hall itself, lighted up by a mixture of
coal gas and oxygen, is in the highest degree surprising. The
effects caused by the little bluish flames are Quite peculiar, and
cannot be compared with any other light. The green of the
trees seems more vivid, the colours of the dresses more brilliant,
and, above all, the faces of the people appear clearer, every shade
and colour showing almost as distinctly as in full daylight, not-
withstanding which the light did not tire the eyes.
"The lavourable impression made on entering the grounds is
heightened on entering the large second-class waiting-room,
where everything, down to the minutest detail of ornamentation,
is most distinctly seen by the light of the little flames of only two
moderate-sizeJ gaseliers.
"Ho *ever, the best conception of the new method of lighting
is produced in the up-train station-hall. Here, in order to make
the comparison more striking, the ordinary platform used by
up-train passengers was lighted with heavy gas and oxygen, only
half the number of jets being lit as were used on the opposite
platform, where the old gas was burning with the aid of oxygen.
Notwithstanding the double number of lamps and the good
quality of the gas, the space lighted by the new method was
incomparably mare brilliant. The shadows of the candelabra,
and even of the smoky flames, were perceptible on the white

walls."
In spite of this favourable impression, Herr Haase comes
to the conclusion that the new double gas, conducted in
two pipes, is not adapted for general private use, particu-
larly for the following reasons:—"The advantage of its bril-
liancy is more than counterbalanced by its cost, which in
Berlin, taking the usual lighting power as the standard of
comparison, would amount to double the price of the ordinary
gas : the consumer would not understand the working of the
cocks: the oxygen would deteriorate in the long conducting
pipes, and the repairs would be expensive, &c. Although for
public buildings, for shops, and some other purposes, the new
method might answer, it would be impossible to lay down three
gaspipes for these limited ends." This opinion stands diametri-
cally opposed to that of Schiele,5 who warmly recommends the
new method of lighting, but it is in close accordance with the
opinion stated by Le Blanc,3 about a year before, in a report to
the Town CouncU of Paris. This report is the result of exten-
sive researches by Messrs. Feligot, Lamy, Troost, De Moniesir,

"This did not prevent medical speculators from opening an
institution in Berlin for inhaling oxygen, where it is now being
sold at "jd. the cubic foot, while oxygen water is sold at 2d. the
bottle. As water of 0° does not absorb 4 per cent of its volume,
a half-litre bottle contains less than 20 cb.m., or 00017
grammes ol this gas! It seems incredible that such a dose
should be expected to produce any effect whatever. Just as travel-
lers are recommended to provide themselves with concentrated

greatest heights ever reached by man. The want of breath and
symptoms of suffocation which ensued, when the barometer
stood at from 300 to 250 mm., were, according to his account,
at once relieved by one breath of pure oxygen. A mixture of
the same with atmospheric air proved even more effectual than
the pure gas, and, on an aerial voyage which the late MM. Croce
Spinelli and Sivel undertook from Paris on the 22nd ot March,

1874, they provided themselves with mixtures containing 45 and
75 per cent, of oxygen to 55 and 25 per cent, of nitrogen.
They were enabled by the help of this gas to make valuable
physical observations,3 at heights of more than 6,000 metres,
leisurely and without any bodily inconvenience; and although
Glaisher had succeeded in reaching still greater heights without
this assistance, oxygen offers a means of gaining strata hitherto
inaccessible."
These words, however, were scarcely written when the news-
papers announced the death of the courageous navigators on a
new aerial voyage; suffocation appears to have set in so suddenly
as to incapacitate them at once from using their respiratory
apparatus.
The physiological applications of oxygen form the bridge to
tome considerations on the practical uses of ozone, the discovery
of which had been greeted by exaggerated hopes.

THE speech of Lord Salisbury in the House of Lords
on Thursday evening, on introducing a Bill for
regulating the reform of Oxford University, will probably
satisfy the expectations with which the declaration of the
Government policy has been awaited, "t is a fortunate
circumstance that the conduct of the measure should be
placed in the hands of one who is, at the same time,
Chancellor of the University, a minister in whom both
his party and the country have entire confidence, and
also a well-known friend of the physical sciences. The
Government scheme, therefore, is introduced under
favourable auspices; and, in itself, so far as it has been
yet revealed, it seems calculated to disarm all opposition.
It is true that much yet remains to be learned concern-
ing the modes in which the scheme is to operate. The
names of the Commissioners, to whom a certain degree
of control is apparently to be entrusted, will be looked
for with anxiety; and the details, which will only be

understood when the bill is printed, will also be of much
interest to those who will be directly affected by them.
But the gensral public, who are after all the party most
concerned, is contented with the enunciation of principles
which Lord Salisbury's speech contains. He argued,
with great ingenuity, that it is not possible for Parliament
to dictate to the University and College authorities the
precise lines of reorganisation along which they are to
proceed. This argument suggests much that a party
critic may object to as involving an abnegation on the
part of Ministers of their own proper responsibility.
However that may be, it is certain that people at large
are totally incapable of giving an intelligent approval to
anything more definite than the proposals which Lord
Salisbury has sketched. Indeed, it may be doubted
whether the absence of complete knowledge to which
Lord Salisbury himself pleaded guilty, though it may
somewhat surprise and disturb Oxford residents, will not
have the effect of bringing him into closer harmony with
the general feeling of the country. The case for reform
does not rest upon minor matters of detail which require
research to discover and particular experience to appre-
ciate, and of which the meaning might be altogether
altered by further research and wider experience. The
plain statement of the facts is enough, and upon that

plain statement Lord Salisbury has wisely relied.
The collective revenue of the Oxford Colleges, after
making certain necessary deductions, amounts to some-
thing over 200,000/. per annum; and as the number of
undergraduates is less than 1,000, it follows that the
average income per undergraduate is a little more than
200/. a year. It is important that this estimate should
not be interpreted as if it meant the average cost of edu-
cating each undergraduate, as Lord Salisbury has not
sufficiently guarded himself against the possibility of this
confusion. The real meaning of the calculation is to
indicate forcibly that at the present time endowment is
out of all proportion to educational efficiency. Looking
at the figures from another point of view, we find that,
Voi, xni.—No. 331
out of the total endowments, Fellowships of one kind or
another take just one-half or 100,000?. Of this sum,
again, Lord Salisbury estimates that " idle Fellowships,"
or those to which no duties are attached, absorb from
one-half to four-fifths. There is thus left a balance of
from 50,000/. to 80,000/. a year, which is admittedly not

tained." The second principle enunciated by Lord
Salisbury is the endowment of research—a principle
which has been long advocated in these columns, but
which now for the first time appears destined to obtain
legislative sanction. In the case of its distinguished
sojourner, Prof. Max Miiller, the University of Oxford
has already admitted its duties in this matter; and now
research in the physical sciences, under the jegis of Lord
Salisbury, and with all the authority that Parliament can
lend, will put in its claim to be " made a part of the regular
and recognised machinery of the University." To many
persons this will be thought the greatest novelty con-
tained in the speech, and it is significant that none of the
three peers who followed the mover made any allusion to
it in their brief remarks. But it is not necessary now to
expatiate upon the importance of the proposal, or the
valuable results that will flow from it. It is the first fruits
of the Royal Commission on the Advancement of Science,
and will lead, we trust, to the adoption of more of the
recommendations made by that laborious body. It is of
more importance on this occasion to call attention to a

distinction which Lord Salisbury has apparently drawn,
and to which the Colleges would do well to take heed.
If.we understand his words aright, he would impose upon
the University the duty of supplying, of course from the
College endowments, the capital sum that will be required
"from time to time for buildings and apparatus, neces-
sary for the purposes of research ;" while he would leave
to the individual colleges " to provide for the maintenance
and benefit of persons of known ability and learning, who
may be engaged in study or research in the realms of
art and science." This distinction seems to us an im-
portant one, partly because it assigns to each the functions
which they can best perform, with the least revolution in
their characters; and still more because it insists upon
two separate modes of endowing research, which are of
equal value, and must be both demanded alike. We
cannot forbear quoting at some length the comprehensive
views of Lord Salisbury on this subject:—" We are of
opinion that the mere duty of communicating knowledge
to others does not fulfil all the functions of a University, and
that the best Universities in former times have been those
in which the instructors, in addition to imparting learning,
were engaged in adding new stores to the already acquired
accumulation of knowledge. There are new sciences
which have gained, and which are pressing for, admission

to the Universities, and I think no one can doubt that it
is for the interest alike of the students and of the nation
at large that such sciences should have full encourage-
ment. . . . What I am particularly anxious for is that all
branches of culture should have equal encouragement, and
should be regarded, not as rivals, but as allies in the great
and difficult task of cultivating and developing the human
mind." Apart from these two leading features of the
Government scheme of University Reform—the endow-
ment of the University by the Colleges, and the endow-
ment of Research— it remains only to notice the ease with
which Lord Salisbury, in one short sentence, brushes
aside "the religious difficulty " as unworthy of attention.
"The teachers at Oxford are not clergymen now, and if we
want to get the best men, we must get them from other
sources than that which formerly supplied them."
With regard to the machinery by which these great
reforms are to be effected, it is better that criticism
should wait until fuller explanation is given. On a first
glance, it would seem that the colleges are to be allowed
a year and a half to devise their own schemes of reform,

the Commission as tend to justify the position taken up
by the Society, leaving the advocates of vivisection, as it
tells us in a prefatory note, to give publicity to such parts
of the evidence as favour their views. We have selected
the witnesses quoted by this Society as giving evidence
upon the extension and abuses of vivisection, in order that
we might not run the risk of being misled by part'al
statements and of under-estimating the extent to which
the practice prevails in this country.
The first of these, Dr. Acland, observes that the number
of persons in this and other countries who are becoming
biologists without being medical men is very much in-
creasing ; but beyond this statement, in which he appears
to have in view professional physiologists rather than
occasional experimenters, there is nothing in his evidence
to lead to the belief that vivisection is practised to any
extent by the latter class. Mr. G. H. Lewes tells us that
so far from ignorant people exercising their fancy in
cutting up live animals, even medical students are ex-
tremely reluctant to perform experiments at all on
account of the trouble involved in doing so. Sir

William Ferguson states that the impression on his
mind is that experiments are done very frequently
in a most reckless] manner; but when we look for
the grounds of this belief we cannot find anything
except the accounts given by students of experiments
they had seen during lectures. We should have
thought a man of Sir William's experience would not have
trusted to such hearsay evidence without farther inves-
tigation, knowing, as he must do, how students delight to
exaggerate and to tell frightful stories of the dissecting-
room for the pleasure of seeing their mother's or sister's
eyes grow wide with horror at the tale. The evidence of
other witnesses shows that such exaggeration must have
been practised here, and that no such experiments as Sir
William describes have been performed in any medical
school in this country. But this witness is of opinion that
it is only in laboratories and schools that vivisection is
carried on, as in this country surgeons do not employ it
for the purpose of acquiring dexteiity, and he thinks there
is not much amateur physiology. Such evidence from an
active opponent of vivisection goes far to show that the
number of occasional experimenters cannot be great,
and that the practice of vivisection is almost entirely con-
fined to the fifteen or twenty persons alluded to by the
Commissioners. Small as this number is, we would have

considered it right to legislate if anything like wanton cruelty
had been shown to be practised by them; but the Secretary
of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals admits that he does not know a single case of
the sort, and that in general English physiologists have
used anaesthetics where they think they can do so with
safety to the experiment. Such being the case, it seems
to us that the objections raised to legislative interference
by several witnesses carry great weight. Those made
by Mr. John Simon are especially worthy of considera-
tion, not only on account of his well-known ability and
clear-sightedness, but because his official position has
given him a better opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the working of laws and of forming a correct judg-
ment regarding the probable operation of any proposed
bill than other witnesses who are constantly engaged
either in the laboratory or with the cares of practice.
The opinion he expresses that incompetent experimen-
ters, careless of the sufferings they inflict, do not exist
as an appreciable class in this country, is borne out by
the evidence we have already referred to, and it does

preference those which will be useful to the reader if he
cares to refer to them."
This last sentence fully accounts for the character of
the work. We may say at once that we have not read it
through. Our readers will probably soon see why. But
we may get a good idea of its contents.by dipping in here
and there. Geologists do not require to break a mountain
down into road metal in order to discover its structure.
The book is by no means a paste and scissors production;
it is evidently the outcome of very considerable mental
exertion, not only in reading, but in thinking. But, un-
fortunately, the author seems to have accepted as equally
trustworthy guides some of the best and most authorita-
tive works extant, and along with them some, often
of the trashiest, volumes [of the popular scientific lite-
rature of the day. In several, especially of the earlier
chapters, the first class of works is mainly referred to,
in others the second; a few chapters are based upon
a mixture, consequently the result is. extremely curious
and instructive, at least to the scientific critic.
As a whole, the work is decidedly superior to any of

the popular ones on which part of it is based ; though of
course, as they have to a certain extent leavened it, it is
in many places not only inaccurate, but positively as-
tounding in its misrepresentations. It is quite easy, how-
ever, to trace in each case the more extraordinary
blunders to their popular scientific source.
Recent British popular scientific works, at least since
we have lost such masters as Faraday and Herschel,
have, in general, one or other of two marked charac-
teristics. The honest but ignorant man, too ignorant to be
aware of *his own ignorance, complacently and in good
faith writes preposterous nonsense. Our author has
wisely let him alone.
Other quasi-scientific men are acute enough to know,
perhaps even to admit to themselves (but only under the
strictest seal of secrecy) their own ignorance. Some-
times they may condescend so far from their pedestals as
to seek assistance from those who are really competent
to give it, but even then they do not save themselves.
The true critic easily perceives by a single loose word or
phrase which such writers cannot refrain from adding to
the accurate periods of their mentor (if only to save their
own consciences on the question of originality) the true
state of the case.
When the quasi-scientific writer feels diffidence in

asking assistance, he gets out of his difficulty by adopting
what has been well called the "cuttle-fish dodge," and
bewilders his readers by squirting in their faces a cloud
of inky verbiage. Our author has trusted too implicitly
to him.
Our readers must now have a notion of what seems
to us, at least, the character of this book. The style
is clear and good, and many of the incidental re.
marks and comments are happy. The early chapters,
referring as they do mainly to subjects little treated by
the modern popular science writers, are, as a rule, very
much superior to the later ones, and in many places may
be not merely passed as satisfactory, but even highly
commended. For instance, the discovery of the law of
compression of gases such as air, at constant tempera-
tures, is, for once in a popular book, actually assigned to
Boyle himself, though even here the pernicious influence
of the popular quasi-scientific writers has asserted itself in
the unwarrantable introduction of the perpetual Mariotte.
There are some very sensible remarks on Werner and
Hutton, and we are glad to see that William Smith's

2. What is i° Fahr. of heat?
One might just as correctly ask, "What is 1 oz. troy of
time?" We have heard of degrees of temperature, and of
quantities of heat, but we are totally unable to conceive
what could correctly be designated by i° Fahr. of heat,
though it is clear that it is here used for " the quantity of
heat which can raise the temperature of a pound of water
by i° F." But let us proceed to our final extract:—
"If you have understood this explanation, you will have
some idea of the theory that heat is altered motion ; but
to complete the history we require not only to turn work
into heat, but also to turn heat into work. This had
already been done many years before by a French engi-
neer, M. Carnot, though he did not understand its real
significance, but it has now been most beautifully proved
by a long series of experiments made by M. Him, of
Colmar, in Alsace. What M. Hirn practically did was to
find out how much heat can be obtained from a ton of
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
coals, and then to find out how much work was performed
in an engine by that amount of heat. This was by no means
a simple task, for much heat is lost in various ways in
passing through the engine; and even when he thought
he had allowed for all this, it was found that some of the
steam had turned back into water on its way, and thus
used up some of the heat. At last, however, when all
was carefully measured and calculated, he found that for
er>ery peloid of water heated 1° F., enough work had been
done to raise a weight of 1 lb. to a height of 7J2 feet.
This, you will notice, was exactly the converse of Joule's
experiment, and proved that exactly as much motion is
produced by means of confined heat as there is heat pro-
duced by means of checked motion."
This is certainly very novel information. We have
hitherto been accustomed to think that "What M. Hirn
practically did was [not] to find out how much heat can
be obtained from a ton of coals," but to find how much of
that heat disappeared by having been actually converted
into useful work in an engine.
But enough has been said to show the necessity for the
correction of those "grave errors" alluded to in the
second extract made above from the Preface.

concludes, and which is carried on to 1874, we would

only remark that it would not have been unduly extended
if a little space could have been found for even a bare
mention of a few such names as Andrews, Forbes,
Graham, Stokes, Thomson, and Clerk-Maxwell in our
own islands, and a few more like Helmholtz, Foucault,
Pliicker, and Weber abroad. Surely such names should

subject of wine and its adulterations ; for much on this
matter the author is indebted to the valuable work of
Thudichum and Dupr<5. The question of "plastering"
meets with due consideration. This time-honoured opera-
tion (it appears to have been practised by the Greeks and
Romans) consists in adding finely-powdered plaster of
Paris, or sulphate of lime, to the must in the proportion
of about 40 lbs. of the plaster to a butt of must, with the
view of separating out the vegetable acids in the grape-
juice, and thereby, in the opinion of our author, substi-
tuting " for the healthful and beneficial tartrates, a bitter
and aperient salt"—sulphate of potash. The wines
more particularly subjected to this process are sherry,
port, and certain French and Greek wines. It ap-
peared to Dr. Hassall "that any process whereby the
sulphuric acid can be removed and the original tartaric
acid restored, and in the form in which it previously
existed, namely, as a tartrate of potash, is highly desir-
able, and would improve greatly the flavour and quality
of all wines which had been plastered, and increase very
considerably their money value." Accordingly he has
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
devised such a process in conjunction with Mr. Hehner,
and has obtained for it provisional protection with the
intent to take out a patent: it consists in treating the
wine with tartrate of barium, with occasional shaking, for
three or four days. "At the end of this time all but the
normal quantity of the sulphuric acid of the wine is pre-
cipitated as sulphate of barium, while the tartaric acid is
restored in exactly the same amount in which it was
originally present; this, uniting with the now liberated
potash, gives rise once more to the formation of tartrate
of potash, the most characteristic saline constituent of all
genuine wines." This " deplaitering" process may have
all the virtues which its authors claim for it, but since
barium salts are in the highest degree poisonous, we, at
least, should prefer that our sherry retained all its aperient
qualities unimpaired, rather than it should be manipulated
with compounds of that element.
In reading this book the question has more than once
occurred to us: What must be its effect on the non-pro-
fessional mind—or indeed on the mind of anybody who,
with the view of extending his notions of the principles
of alimentation, takes it up for an hour or so in the
evening? He will find that the water he drinks

tracting ; he is told that the tea which he adds to it may
be largely composed of the leaves of Chloranthus incon-
spicuus, or of "lie-tea," a vile compound of tea-dust,
foreign leaves, sand, and oxide of iron, the whole occa-
sionally coated with "Prussian blue, turmeric, China
clay, or other white mineral powder." The sugar with
which he sweetens the infusion may be infested with the
Acarns sacchari, which, he is informed, belongs "to the
same genus as the Acarus scabici, or itch-insect, than
which, however, it is larger, and possessed of an organi-
sation still more formidable." The milk which he adds
to it may be "blue" not merely as he is content to
believe through the machinations of the vendor, but from
the presence of what the author in one place, following
Fuchs, calls Vibrio cyanogencus, and in another place
Oidium lactis, or Penicillium. The question whether
fungus or vibrio pales into insignificance before the fact
that milk of this kind gives rise to "gastric irritation " or

Prof, Tyndall on Germs
I am very glad I wrote to you putting my questions t >
Prof. Tyndall. It has drawn from him a letter, full of all
sorts of hints and prophecies and information and pleasant
observations on details with which I had not thought of
troubling him; and there is even a delicate bit of flattery
for poor me, of whom the Professor knows nothing. It is
really quite a gem of a letter, a beautiful example of that
"tour piquant" referred to by M. Pasteur, which the
Professor gives to everything he touches, and which we
at home know how to value as well as any Frenchman.
There is only one fault in it, and that is that the Pro-
fessor, in the exuberance of his kindness, has unfortunately
forgotten to answer my modest questions. But why does he
liken himself to Horatius, and talk of enemies yet to be dealt
with? Horatius did not sing his paean before going into battle.

And how can Prof. Tyndall have any enemies? I thought that
scientific investigators were all brothers. I regarded Prof.
Tyndall as a brother keeping a bright look out due north, and
Dr. Bastian as a brother with his eye firmly set towards the
south, while Dr. Sanderson seemed to me to be a remarkably
silent brother gazing somewhere about sou'-sou'-west-and-by-
south-a-quarter-south.
But to be serious. Briefly put, the situation seems to be this.
Prof. Tyndall has propounded a theory—no mere speculation
raising a trifling controversy to be settled privately with Dr.
Sanderson or Dr. anybody else, but a momentous theory on
which, as he says, "the lives of men depend," and the truth of
which it concerns all men to sift It is not addressed to any
scientific coterie, but widely published for the benefit of the
outside world, the like of me among the rest.
The theory as propounded stands or falls with the assertion
tint when, with due precautions, an orgmic fluid is boiled for a
few minu'es in a flask, which is then hermetically sealed, it is
impossible to obtain bacterial putrefaction.
What Trof. Tyndall declares to be impossible, that Dr. San-
derson declares that he has done.
If Dr. Sanderson is right there is an end of the theory, and
the lives of men must rest on some other ba^is.
If Prof. Tyndall is r ght, Dr. Sanders m (not to put too fine a
point upon it) has blundered in his very careful experiments.

Anxious to know where I should look for the truth, I ven-
ture to ask Prof. Tyndall which alternative he adopted. Instead
of helping me out of my difficulty he has responded with a
flourish of rhetoric about not crossing swords with Dr. Sander-
son. It is plainly from no want of courtesy that Prof. Tyndall
has declined to satisfy my curiosity. He can't help being
courteous; and to the class to which I belong—simple students
who hang upon the lips of Professors for their scientific sus-
tenance—he invariably overflows with courtesy.
1 am sure he would have answered me if he could.
Even now I should be grateful (and so I believe would many
more of us outsiders) if on second thoughts he should resolve to
put his rhetorical sword into the unadorned scabbard of common
sense, and kindly try to answer three plain questions :—
1. Does he accept Dr. Sanderson's experiments, and give up
his theory?
a. Does he re;ect Dr. Sanderson's experiments as untrust-
worthy, and why?

theory with established facts?

With fuller information on the rare and unstable compounds,
than is to be found in ordinary text books (such as "Miller's
Elements"), no doubt numerous other instances might be
noticed; these, however, will suffice to exemplify the general
law.
With regard to black compounds, I have not included them
in the above list, as they only complicate it unnecessarily; the
ordinary term black being used to describe a very minute amount
of any possible colour. It is only when the predominating
colour is observed (as blue- olive- red-black, &c.), that the
description is of any value. "Brown " is likewise ill-defined in
its spectral position, as various tints called brown generally
include a small quantity of any colour except blue. Black and
brown compounds are therefore inconclusive without a spectral
examination of the colour in each case.
The real anomalies to the above law are the following com-
pounds. CrCl2 white, CraCl6 violet; MnCI, pale pink, MnCl3
green brown; As2Sa red, As2S3 yellow; HgCl yellow white,
HgCl2 white; Aul yellow, Aul3 green. In these five pairs the

formity of six cases in seven to a rule is sufficient to establish it

One or two other cases might at first seem to be also excep-

of the base is the same element as that of the acid, they are not
necessarily to be compared with binary compounds.
In the order of the colours, it will be observed that, in nume-
rous cases, white occurs between blue and yellow compounds;
and there is only one instance of a violet compound with more
of the electro-negative element than its white connection. As
white light comes (in the natural arrangement) between blue
and yellow, this order is more in accordance with the spectrum
than is the order of metachromism announced by Mr. Ackroyd,
in which white occurs before violet.
It may be worth notice that the electro-negative elements
(whose increase reddens' the compounds) are, on the whole,
rather more red and yellow than the electro-positive, many of
which are bluish, and even dark blue, as Na.
This order of colours in successive compounds of a series
(which might be called taxichromism) was observed by the writer
some few years ago, in connection with the spectral order in
metachromism; the latter, however, was only traced through a
dozen or so, of the oxides, without pursuing the subject farther.

Seasonal Order of Colour in Flowers
I think it may be useful to mention, in reference to several
letters on this subject in Nature, that light appears to have no
direct influence on the tints of flowers. I quote the following
from Sachs's Textbook, Engl, transl., p. 675 :—
"As long as sufficient quanlilies of assimilated material have
been previously accumulated, or are produced by green leaves
exposed to the light, flowers are developed even in continuous
deep darkness which are of normal size, form, and colour, with
perfect pollen and fertile ovules, ripening their fruits and pro-
ducing seeds capable of germination."

computation of the perturbations with the improved
values for the masses of the disturbing planets must tend
to diminish the uncertainty that at present exists with
regard to the possible error of Bessel's determination of
the date of next passage through perihelion. If this
should fall about 1887, February 9, as he computed, we
might expect that the comet would be detected in Sep-
tember previous in the constellation Monoceros; its
intensity of light would gradually increase until its nearest
approach to the earth (05) at the end of the year, when
it might be a conspicuous naked eye object in Ursa
Major, within 200 N.P.D., and possibly it would be ob-
servable till the following May. Subjoined are figures
which will enable any reader who is interested in the
matter to trace the comet's course more precisely, upon
the above supposition as to perihelion passage.

The Governments of Belgium, France, Germany, Holland,
Italy, and Switzerland, have appointed committees to act
in union with the general committee ; and the Government
of the United States has placed itself in communication
with the various institutions and Government departments.
Russia intends to contribute an interesting collection from
the Pedagogical Museum; and the Russian Academy
have formed a committee under Prof. Struve. The
Austrian Minister of Instruction has taken the matter in
hand for that country, and one of his officers, Mr. Fidler,
is in correspondence with the Science and Art Depart-
ment. I mention this to show you the intense interest
that foreign countries have taken in the matter, and that
to their assistance and co-operation we feel very much in-
debted. The appeals made to Government departments,
scientific institutions, and men of science at home have

a historical collection of telegraphic apparatus as exists;

Ordnance Survey, Royal Observatory, and Geological

received, but we understand they are taking steps to
contribute several objects of interest, especially from
the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. The Royal Society

has been thought that they possess some, though cer-
tainly not very close, affinities with the Rodentia, and
also with the Sircnia. It is certain, however, that the
two species of Elephant which are the sole living repre-
sentatives of the order, stand quite alone among existing
mammals, widely differing from all others in many parts
of their structure, being in some respects, as in the skull,
dentition and proboscis, highly specialised, though in
others, as in the presence of two anterior venae cava; and
in the structure of the limbs, retaining a low or gene-
ralised condition. A considerable series of extinct forms,
extending back through the Pliocene and Miocene epochs,
show the same type under still more generalised outlines.
Though no. true Proboscidians have as yet been found in
any Eocene formations, certain recently discovered forms
of that epoch from North America, if their affinities are
rightly interpreted, may link them to some unknown
primitive type of Perissodactyle Ungulate. The consider-
ation of these will, however, be reserved until the next
lecture.

All the true Proboscidea are arranged in three principal
groups or genera—Elephas, Mastodon, and Dinotherium.
Their molar teeth, by which the extinct species are chiefly
known, present a remarkable series of modifications, from
the comparatively simple tapiroid teeth of Dinotherium,
with two or three strongly pronounced transverse ridges,
and a normal mode of succession, to the extremely com-
plex structure and anomalous mode of replacement found
in the true Elephants. The intermediate conditions occur
in the various species of Mastodon. In this genus the
enamel-covered transverse ridges of each tooth are gene-
rally more numerous than in Dinotherium, and often
complicated by notches, or by accessory columns attached
to them, but in the unworn tooth they stand out freely
from the crown, with deep valleys between. In the Ele-
phants the ridges are still further increased in number,
and are greatly extended in vertical height, so that, in
order to give solidity to what would otherwise be
a laminated or pectinated tooth, it becomes necessary
to envelop and unite the whole with a large mass of
cementum, which completely fills up the valleys, and
gives a general smooth appearance to the organ when
unworn ; but as the wear consequent upon the masticating
process proceeds, the alternate layers of tissue of different
hardness, cement, dentine, and enamel, which are dis-

closed on the surface, form a fine and very efficient
triturating instrument. The modification of the tooth of
a Mastodon into that of an elephant is therefore precisely
the same in kind as that of the molar of a Palaeotherium
into that of a horse, or of the corresponding tooth of an
early Artiodactyle into that of an ox. The intermediate
stages, moreover, even as our knowledge already extends,
are so numerous that it is not possible to draw a definite
line between the two types of tooth structure. As regards
the mode of succession, that of the modern elephants is,
as before mentioned, very peculiar. During the complete
lifetime of the animal there are but six molar teeth on
each side of each jaw, with occasionally a rudimentary
one in front, completing the typical number of seven.
The last three represent the true molars of the ordinary
mammals, those in front appear to be milk molars, which
are never replaced by permanent successors, but the
¦whole series gradually moves forwards in the jaw, and
the teeth become worn away, and their remnants cast out
in front, while development of others proceeds behind.
The individual teeth are so large and the processes of

The remainder of the skeleton is imperfectly known, but
apparently agrees in its general characters with the other
Proboscideans. Its remains have been met with in
abundance at Eppelsheim, near Darmstadt, and also in
various other Miocene formations in the South of Ger-
many, France, and Greece; in Asia Minor, Attock in
the Punjab and Perim Island, but whether all belong-
ing to one species {D.giganleum, Kaup.) or to several,
the materials are not at present sufficient to determine.
The genus has not hitherto been found in England or in
America.
The gradual transition in the character of the molar
teeth of various Proboscideans is well illustrated by
the following table (compiled from Dr. Falconer's Me-
moirs) of the "ridge formula" of various species. The
numbers are, however, only averages, and it must be
remarked that the higher the numerical expression of the
ridge formula in the species the more liable is the number
of ridges to vary within certain limits, especially in the
teeth of the lower jaw, where they are often in excess.
Several species, apparently intermediate in ridge formula
to those in the table, have since been discovered, as Mas-

northern, western, and southern margins of the country.
No arrows to show prevalent inclinations of strata have

are given, the reader is left to infer the relations of the
formations whose general area and boundaries are so
clearly defined. The required information may be ex-

PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS
WE have received the following additional letters on
this subject:—
Your Rugby correspondents appear to me somewhat
to misapprehend Dr. N. M. Watts's arguments on
this important question. No satisfactory results, he
maintains, can accrue from science teaching in schools
until the subject is placed upon its true position of educa-
tional equality, both as regards range and time, with
classics and mathematics, and no system of regulations
or of examinations can be said to fulfil its object in which
this position is ignored. I for my own part most cordially
support Dr. Watts's views. The position at present ac-
corded to science in English schools is, as Sir John
Lubbock has clearly shown, anything but satisfactory,
and this state of things seems likely to continue so long
as the examinations for which the boys prepare persist in
placing the science subjects in a distinctly inferior posi-
tion to the older studies. Surely it is the part of examin-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ing bodies to lead and raise the education of the country.
I think, however, that it has been fully proved that the
"Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board"
has not done this, at any rate so far as science is con-
cerned. The facts adduced by Mr. Cumming as to the
small number of candidates presenting themselves for
examination in science proves to my mind that the teach-
ing of science is usually discouraged because it is usually
not understood, and no efficient means of teaching science
being as a rule provided, these subjects are not only
neglected but their study becomes even despised by the
boys. The truth is that it is the difficulty of obtaining
such men as Mr. Wilson and Dr. Watts which renders
the progress of science teaching in schools less rapid than
some of us could wish. As soon as the supply of really
competent and high class natural science masters becomes
as large as that of equally distinguished teachers of classics
or mathematics we may be sure that science will occupy
no inferior position. Until that time arrives it behoves
all those interested in the educational applications of
science to take care that the teaching is really exact,

questions may be called " very easy," yet there are others
quite sufficiently difficult for the ordinary public school-
boy, who has a great many other things to work at
besides natural science.
A boy must have read his chemistry thoughtfully, to
say the least, who could answer the whole of Question 1
thoroughly. In Question 2 there is ample opportunity
for showing a deeper knowledge than could be obtained
by skimming over some "outlines of chemistry." So
again the explanation and illustration of the peculiar
oxidising and reducing properties of nitrites, in Question
4, and the description of the preparation and properties
of the different bodies enumerated in Question 8, could, I
maintain, only be given satisfactorily by boys who had
acquired something more than a mere "modicum" of
chemical knowledge.
It must also be borne in mind that in order to pass
the Chemical Division of Group IV., a boy must take
in, in addition to the chemistry of the metallic and non-
metallic elements and practical analysis, either heat or
magnetism and electricity.

Now although there may be reasons for combining
together heat and chemistry, so long as it is understood
that only the more elementary parts of heat will be
required, yet it is certainly unreasonable to add on as
an extra such a very comprehensive subject as that of
magnetism and electricity, frictional and voltaic, including
electro-magnetism.
Surely, to say the least, electrical science is quite as
worthy of an independent existence as botany or geology,
and I much doubt whether many would hesitate in ad-
mitting it to be much harder than either.
My own opinion is in favour of Mr. Wilson's sugges-
tion—to divide Group IV. into Pass subjects and
Honour subjects, requiring only an elementary knowledge
of theoretical chemistry, and perhaps the simpler parts of
heat for the one, while practical analysis with higher
knowledge of heat, or electricity and magnetism, might
be required from those who aimed at taking honours in
science.
It is perhaps due to the school to say that we can
hardly be supposed to be frightened at the prospect of
these examinations. Last July three in the Sixth took in
chemistry as a certificate subject: all passed and two
obtained "distinction "—three being the total number
who obtained such distinction out of the twenty-eight

In my letter last week, p. 329, I said that the papers
set in science in the certificate examination last year were
very easy. This was a slip. I was absent from England
when they were set, and had never seen them. I had in
my mind the papers of the year before.
The papers of last year were quite hard enough. It
must be remembered that very many schools give only
two lessons a week to science. James M. Wilson

equatorial protuberance, any modification on its surface would
have to be on an enormous scale to produce any sensible effect
upon its axis of revolution. But, after all, is the earth, strictly
speaking, a spheroid ?—and arc not some of the arguments and
dicta based upon its spheroidal character founded on a fallacy?
For it does appear to me a fallacy to treat as one homogeneous
spheroid, a body partly consisting of a mass of ?olid or quasi-
solid matter of irregular form, and partly of a liquid n>a>s in
constant motion, irregularly distributed over a portion of its
surface. No doubt the contour of the liquid portion is, accord-
ing to established geometrical laws, almost that of a regular
spheroid ; but its distribution, except in the case of inland seas,
can have but little to do with the regulation of the movement of
the solid body on which it res's. It is true that Laplace has
maintained that "whatever may be the law of the depth of the
ocean, and whatever the figure of the spheroid which it covers,
the phenomena of precession and nutation will be the same as if
the ocean formed a solid mass with this spheroid ; " but do the
position of the axis of revolution and its permanence in one spot
come under the same category as precession and nutation? It
certainly appears tome that the position of the axis of revolution

must mainly depend upon the form ol the mineral portion of the
globe, and be but in the slightest degree affected by the distribu-
tion of the ocean, the specific gravity of which is moreover only
about one-fifth of that of the more solid portion.
With regard to the permanence ol the axis of rotation, if it must
of necessity coincide with the axis of figure, and if the figure of
the mineral portion of the earth, in consequence of upheavals and
depressions, of the wearing away of continents and the transport-
ation of their constituents by mechanical or even chemical mean',
is being constantly changed, so as to acquire a nnv axis, then the
axis of rotation must also as constantly be undergoing a change of
position.
Let us now glance at some of the irregularities of form of the
more solid part of the globe as at present existing. The difference
between the polar and equatorial diameters of our globe his been
calculated at about 26 miles, or about 13 miles in the radius; but
at the equator itself, little more than one-fifth of the circumference
of the globe is dry lmd, and nearly four-fi'ths are sea ; and this
sea is by no means shallow, as the soundings taken by the
"Tuscarora," the "Challenger," and other exploring vessels will
prove. Leaving those taken near land out of the calculation, I
find that 48 soundings in the Pacific, between 150 and 300 north
latitude, give an average depth of 2,634 fathoms, or 5,26s yards,
that is to say, within a few yards of three miles. The South
Pacific does not appear to have been so well explored ; but
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
across the Atlantx, in the equatorial regions between 10° N. and
10° S., I find that an average of 32 soundings gives a mean
depth of 2,309 fathoms, or 4.61S yards, while, in one spot in
lat. 15° S,, Sir James Ross did not find the bottom with
a line of 4,600 fathoms, or nearly 5} miles. In the Indian
Ocean, within the same limits, 20 soundings give an average of
2,468 fathoms, or 4,936 yards, or more than z\ miles. Taking
these soundings as fair representations of the depth of the sea in
the neighbourhood of the equator, it appears that we may at once
reduce the equa'orial diameter of the more solid part of the
globe by from 5] to 6 miles over nearly four-fifths of its circum-
ference; that is to say, we may reduce the usually accepted
equatorial protuberance from about 13 miles to a little over 10.
It is not within my province to inquire whether the fact ofso large
a portion of the equatorial protuberance being of so much less
st-ccific gravity thin if it were composed of mineral matter, will
in any way affect the e.-tablished calculations with regard to the
precession of the equinoxes and the nutation of the poles, or, what
is of more importance to us, the inferences with regard to the
crust of the earth which have been thence deduced.
But while so large a portion of the surface of the land is, in

round which they were generated, somewhat nearer to our
doors.
There is yet one point on which, before quitting the subject, I
may add a few words. Sir J. W. Lubbock, in the paper from
which I have already quoted so much, has hinted at the possi-
bility of some want of homogeneity in the constitution of the
globe, so that in cooling, the position of the axis of rotation may
have changed. The varying amount of subterranean heat and
volcanic energy in the same region at different periods of the
earth's existence has frequently been commented on, as has
also the varying degree of subsidence or elevation in the same
tract at different times. The forces, whatever they may be, to
which these upward and downward movements are due, have, as
Sir Charles Lyell has remarked, "shifted their points of chief
development from one region to another, like the volcano and the
earthquake, and are all, in fact, the results of the same internal

Whether changes in the specific gravity of enormous masses of
rock in consequence of their being heated would be of sufficient
degree to disturb the equilibrium of the globe, is a difficult

question ; but the remarkable position of the magnetic poles of
verticity with regard to the actual poles of the earth, and the'
distribution of the magnetic force over the earth's surface may,
as has been suggested to me by Capt. F. J. Evans, F.R.S., have
some geological significance. These poles are in lat. 700 N.,
long. 963° W., and in lat. 734° S., long. 147£° E. If we draw
a circle around the globe, cutting these two points, we find
that the magnetic poles, instead of being 180° apart, are
only about 165° distant in one direction, while they are
about 195° in the other. In like manner the magnetic equa-
tor, or line of no dip, differs considerably in position from
the terrestrial equator, being drawn about 15° to the south over
South America, and about 10° to the north over Africa, and in
passing the great Asiatic continent. There is also this singular
circumstance, which was insisted upon by Sir Edward Sabine
nearly forty years ago—viz., that if the globe be divided into an
eastern and a western hemisphere by a plane coinciding with
the meridian of 100° and 280°, the western hemisphere, or that
comprising the Americas and the Pacific Ocean, has a much
higher magnetic intensity distributed generally over its surface,
than the eastern hemisphere, containing Europe and Africa and
the adjacent part of the Atlantic Ocean. The points of the
greatest intensity of the magnetic force, moreover, do not corre-
spond with the magnetic poles, as there are two such foci in the
northern hemisphere (those of America and Siberia) making it

probable that there are two also in the southern hemisphere.
Such facts would seem more in accordance with a want of
uniformity in the inner constitution of the globe than with its
being a body all the parts of which are arranged in perfect
symmetry. Some abnormal features in the direction of gravity
in different parts of the world seem also to afford corroborative
evidence to the same effect. The subject is one of perhaps too
theoretical a character for the geologist to approach ; but if any
definite connection could be established between terrestrial mag-
netism and the internal constitution of the globe, we might,
possibly, be justified in drawing the Inference from its pheno-
mena, that there are forces in operation in the interior of the
earth by which its equilibrium may have been disturbed, and its
axis of revolution thus caused to change in position.

studded with mines of gold and silver and coal, as teeming with
fertility, and as being rich in ancient monuments, in inscriptions,

considerable difficulty in the production of a science journal in

municated some further experiments in continuation of those
contained in his last memoir. As regards the cases in which
when an ant has found a store of food, other ants make their
way to it, he commenced by relerring to some of his
recent observations. To the edge of a board communi-
cating with the nest he fastened three parallel strips of
paper about a foot long (g, h, and 1). One of these (G) led
to a shallow glasj tray containing a number of larva;. The
object of this was to ascertain how many ants would find the
larvae for themselves under such circumstances, and as a matter
of fact none did so. On the middle strip (H), near the centre,
and at right angles with it he placed two strips of paper 2 inches
long, one (K) leading to another shallow tray containing larva:
(F), while the other (L) rested on the third strip of paper (1).
He then took an ant (F. nigra), marked her, and put her on the
tray F. She immediately took a larva, and went away to the
nest along the strip of paper H. Now it is obvious that by
always causing the marked ant to cross from the strip of paper,
H, to the larva; over a particular bridge of paper, K, and if
whenever a stranger came, the paper bridges, K and L, were
reversed, it would be shown whether the other ants who came

longer period.—M. Neneky, who by the action of formic and

CAROLINE HERSCHEL
Memoir and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel. By
Mrs. John Herschel. (London : John Murray, 1876.)
ASTRONOMY may justly claim to be one of the
most comprehensive branches of human know-
ledge, not merely from the immeasurable extent of the
region which it undertakes to investigate, but from its
embracing in a common boundary, and directing towards a
common end, mental processes and lines of study which
otherwise would have found but little ground for con-
vergence and combination. It is, perhaps, not generally
understood how varied are the courses, or how distinct the
attainments, of those who are comprehended under the
general title of "astronomers," or how strong, more
especially, is the demarcation between the pursuit of
theory and the practice of observation. Very different
are the requirements of Greenwich and Parsonstown.
The collection of facts, and the investigation of the laws
which are gathered from those facts, are entirely distinct
processes, and though the qualifications demanded sepa-
rately for each have occasionally been found in combina-

tion, yet more frequently they have existed in individuals
who have had little in common besides the general end
of their pursuit. Laplace or Clairaut would have exhibited
but little aptitude for wielding the instruments of Slough,
and many an eye that has rested with the liveliest interest
on the magnificence of the lunar scenery, or the mysterious
glories of those regions where the great Creator has
"sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field," would
pore in vain on a page of intricate analytical formulae, or
perhaps turn from it with a feeling of positive dislike and
annoyance.
At the head of the observing class in his own day
everyone will recognise the name of William Herschel.
He did not, indeed, stand as prominently alone as was
formerly supposed in the adopted country which was so
justly proud of him, for he had left a worthy rival in his
native land, where Schroter, armed at first with his
opponent's instruments, and afterwards with those of
Schrader of Kiel, was doing most earnest and faithful
work in his own way. On the moon, indeed, and on
Venus and some of the planetoids, Schroter not only held
his own, but gained an advantage which has been more
fully appreciated as years have passed away. But in the
starry heavens, where Schroter was inefficient, Herschel
was supreme; and in his hands sidereal and nebular

astronomy started out at once into a prominence which
it has since fully maintained. Before his time some forty
double stars had been casually noticed ; his catalogues
comprised about 700 ; and the host of nebulae grew in
far higher proportion, from 103 in Messier's list, to 2,500,
a great part of them most delicate and difficult objects.
Nor was our own system without its corresponding
enlargement, in a new and important planet at an unsus-
pected distance, with a train of most minute attendants,
to say nothing of two additional satellites of Saturn: nor
had the solar phenomena ever been so fully investigated
or so clearly described. No wonder that the records of
Vol. xih.—No. 332
English science should adorn the name of Herschel with
a pre-eminent glory—
"Gloria sideribus quam convenit esse coaevam,
Et tantum coelo commoriente mori."
But other talents, and those of a high order, were com-
bined in the case of this illustrious man. Inheriting a
family gift, he had been originally a musician of con-
siderable eminence—not only the organist of a fashion-

from its very constitution ever shunned the exposure of pub-

We will not predict for this memoir a brilliant but ephe-
meral popularity; it may be thought deficient in attrac-
tiveness by general and unscientific readers ; and perhaps
a very natural partiality may have led to the introduction
of a good deal of unimportant and rather heavy detail;
but it is a book full of interest for those on whose account
we may suppose it to have been especially written; whose
scientific tastes and leanings, particularly if connected
with astronomical or optical pursuits, will awaken in them
a ready sympathy with the difficulties, the labours, and
the triumphs of those with whose domestic habits and
inner life they are thus brought into familiar contact,
and for the first time; for, as the authoress remarks, no
good biography of Sir W. Herschel exists—a reproach,
surely, to our astronomical literature.

very remarkable and original character, exhibited in her
own correspondence; how the talent, hidden during a
neglected and almost menial youth—for she speaks of

having tasted the drudgery of the scullery—was developed
and cultivated by the brother who fully appreciated her
abilities ; how her unwearied industry and diligence could
only be surpassed, if they were surpassed, by his own;
how she gladly did his behests as a public singer; how
they were for many years inseparable companions; how
she attended upon him during the tedious polishing of
his mirrors, often feeding him bit by bit when he was
unable to leave off for meals, in one such instance for
sixteen consecutive hours ; how she prepared his astro-
nomical work, watched with him through nights when the
ink was frozen by her side, and calculated for him in days
when others would have sought repose or amusement;
as to all these evidences of talent and skill and patience,
dedicated simply and humbly, and with the most com-
plete disregard of health and even of personal safety, and
utter abnegation of every selfish thought and feeling, to
her dear brother's service, we would refer our readers to
the book itself. In the portraiture of a very uncommon
character they will assuredly not be disappointed.
But it contains also much interesting detail as to that
brother's life, and draws a picture of his proceedings in
many respects unlike what we, for our own part, had been
used to suppose. Very little, we find, did he enjoy of

labour should have been expended upon a material so
little capable of doing it justice, when the employment of
silvered glass would have given entire permanency to the
beautiful curves which Herschel knew how to bestow.
But that invention was reserved for Foucault at a later
day. Had Sir W. Herschel known of it, the 4-foot mirror
would not only have been of far easier workmanship, but
would still be ready for a comparison of its merits, as to
which there has been much discussion, with the produc-
tions of modern days. This, however, is rather matter
of curiosity than of real use. It is no detraction from
Herschel's well-deserved reputation to suppose that the
four MS. volumes which he left behind, containing all the
details of his experiments and processes, would be found
to add little to the knowledge now possessed by our most
successful reflector makers. As to metal-working, diffi-

vanquished by Lassell and the Earl of Rosse: as to
silvered glass, Steinheil indeed has abandoned the under-

NEW Guinea has been much before the public re-
cently. As our readers know it has been the field
of a number of small exploring expeditions, the somewhat
fragmentary results of which have only served to whet
our appetite for more information. Most of these expe-
ditions, under such men as Meyer, Beccari, D'Albertis,
and Miklucho Maclay, have been occupied with the
western part of the island, our knowledge of the eastern
and larger half having been practically almost a blank.
Capt. Lawson's wonderful work (Nature, vol. xii. p. 83)
with its abundance of astounding statements can scarcely
be regarded as a contribution to our knowledge of the
island, though it has made us still more anxious to know
the truth about a land which, even in the present ad-
vanced state of geographical knowledge, seems to have
unknown wonders to reveal Quite recently we heard of
the discovery of a large river debouching on the south
coast, and of a gigantic bird, and the signs of an equally
gigantic quadruped having been seen. Only last week
we were able to give some news of the indefatigable
D'Albertis. Then the Australian colonists are casting

mountainous, a range of mountains running north-west
through the centre of the island, having its culmination
in Mt. Owen Stanley, 13,205 feet. The three islands
mentioned above, as also the D'Entrecasteaux Islands,
contain mountains of considerable altitude, and along a
great portion of the north coast densely wooded moun-
tains come right down to the coast. The north coast is
marked by an almost entire absence of the reefs which
are so characteristic of the south coast. Some minute
survey work was done among the islands in the south-
east, with the result that a passage has been found which
will shorten most materially the voyage from Australia
to China. Another important service done by Capt.
Moresby to navigation was the accurate survey of the
channel in Torres Straits.
Captain Moresby landed on many points of the coast
surveyed as well as on the islands, and invariably he and
his officers and men became the best of friends with the
natives. Captain Moresby's skill in managing savages
cannot be surpassed. By tact and patience he in almost
every instance managed to obtain a cordial welcome from

the natives not only of New Guinea, but of the many
islands which he visited to the east of Australia. Not in
a single instance was it found necessary to take life, and
we would recommend all who have to deal .with uncivi-
lised people to study Capt. Moresby's tactics. The natives
of the part of New Guinea visited Capt. Moresby speaks
of as belonging to the Malay type, lighter coloured than
the Papuans, and with the characteristic and elaborately
done-up long frizzled hair. They are probably a modifi-
cation of the genuine Papuan, possibly in the direction of
the Malay type, though more probably the modification
may be the result of circumstances or of mixture with or
gradation into a more distinctly Polynesian type. They
are well-made, gentle in demeanour, and stand compara-
tively high in the scale of uncivilised men, both in intel-
ligence and in art. They are evidently comfortable and
happy, living in good houses built on piles, and having
abundance at hand to supply all their wants. Many
of them seemed not to possess the bow—the spear,
club, and hatchet being the chief weapons on the south
coast. The officers and crew of the Basilisk brought
away quite a shipload of weapons, utensils, and orna-
ments, some of them of really exquisite workmanship.
The use of the metals is quite unknown among most of
the people visited, who in many cases turned up their

noses at the hoop-iron with which the ship was so abun-
dantly supplied, and who with difficulty could be made to
see the superiority of the iron hatchet. Capt. Moresby
gives many valuable notes on these interesting people,
which we commend to the notice of ethnologists.
One very curious custom is referred to in the south-
east, which, when first seen, roused the indignation of
those on board the Basilisk, Dut which Capt. Moresby
wisely tolerated. A native, lollowed by a number of
others, rushed on board bearing a dog, which, before
anyone could interfere, he caught by the legs and
dashed out its brains on the deck. This was horribly
shocking, but Capt. Moresby rightly surmised that it
was meant as a pledge of friendship. Indeed, the poor
natives were evidently utterly bewildered when the officer
on duty bundled them out of the ship and threw the poor
dog's body after them, and it was only on Capt. Moresby's
going on shore and professing friendship that they were
quieted. Another method of friendly salutation is to
squeeze the nose and the navel simultaneously with the
fore-finger and thumb of each hand; the natives were

would be found perfectly salubrious and productive in
the highest degree. We cannot see the force of some
of the arguments with which Capt. Moresby supports
his plea for annexation. His strong attachment to
the natives and his desire for their welfare we think
mislead him as to how this is to be accomplished. If
New Guinea is to be colonised by white men, all previous
experience teaches us that the natives will inevitably suffer,
will be demoralised, and ultimately extinguished. It is
inexpressibly sad to think of such a fate overtaking these
gentle and altogether superior natives of New Guinea;
but how can it be helped, unless it is resolved to put a
stop to the increase in the white portion of the world's
population. We commend the Appendix to the notice of
all interested in Australia, which already is beginning to
feel itself overcrowded, and must sooner or later over-
flow, for, as is well known, the interior is a blank.
If this country does not speedily annex New Guinea,
some other country, with possibly less regard for the
interests of the natives, certainly will. We hope at least
that Capt. Moresby's work will be the means of giving a

teresting island. Why don't the governments of the
various Australian colonies combine to organise an expe-

and assistance of the imperial government? With a man

This is an attractive little volume, suitable for a child's

formation, accompanied by some excellent woodcuts, and
six gorgeously coloured plates.1 Although not wholly free
from errors, most of them are happily confined to the
chapter on Lepidoptera. It may not be amiss to point
them out, as they are likely to mislead, and should be
corrected in a subsequent edition.
It is doubtful whether the general reader will compre-
hend the author's statement that "there are no herma-
phrodites in the class" of insects; the frequent occurrence
of gynandromorphous specimens in collections being a
seeming contradiction to this assertion.

The description of the oviposition of Chrysopa (pp. 62,
63) is not accurate. The insect, touching the surface of
the plant-stem with her abdomen, draws out a thread of
viscous matter, and by not at once excluding the egg
attached thereto, gives it time to harden ; it is only by not
remoz>in% her body, or depositing the egg too soon, that
the upright hair-like thread is produced.
In the chapter on Lepidoptera a number of statements
are made, which (however seemingly true to the mere tyro
in entomology) are perfectly erroneous: thus it is not true
that butterflies ever have less than six legs, although the
first pair are, in some families, aborted ; butterflies cannot
be separated from moths by any distinctions but those
which serve to divide their families ; for a butterfly has not

Professor von Siebold and the Freshwater Fishes of
England
The object of the present letter is to appeal to naturalists
throughout the British islands to assist ;Prof. von Siebold—the
eminent zoologist of Munich—in his studies of the freshwater
fishes of Europe. Prof. Siebold is preparing a new edition of
his well-known work on that subject, and is exceedingly anxious
to obtain specimens of some of our British freshwater fishes to
compare with the specimens which he has collected from all parts
of Europe. In spite of various attempts, he has, I am very sorry
to have to say, failed to obtain specimens from English naturalists.
I am sure that this can be only owing to the fact that he has not
been able to make his wants known directly to those who could
help him. I have not myself been able to do much in supplying
the specimens of which he forwarded to me a list, but from the
Thames at Oxford have sent him Dace, Bleak, Pope, Miller's

Thumb, and Sticklebacks. The list to which I refer included
the Graining and the Azurine fishes which have been obtained
in or near Knowsley Park ; and I have received a kind assurance
from Lord Derby that efforts shall be made to procure speci-
mens for Prof. Siebold. Specimens of these and of the Powan,
the Pollan, the Gwynlad, and the Vendayce, are the chief de-
siderata which I am anxious to obtain for Prof. Siebold; his list
also includes the Sharp-nosed and the Broad-nosed Eel.
If any naturalist who possesses specimens of these fish which
he can spare for the purposes of scientific investigation, or who
can by reason of local opportunity obtain such specimens, will
forward them to me at University College, London, preserved
in spirit, I will transmit them to Prof. Siebold, taking care that
he shall know to whom he is indebted in each case.
A more difficult task, I am afraid, is that of procuring speci-
mens of the Brine Shrimp, Artemia salitta. Prof. Siebold has
made an extensive study of specimens of Artemia and allied
Branchiopoda from various European localities, and is anxious
to compare English specimens with those from other localities.
He wishes especially to obtain "gatherings" of these Crustacea
in order to determine the absence, presence, and relative abun-
dance of the male sex in different localities. Specimens from
Lymington or from Guernsey would be very welcome.
I hope that through the columns of Nature I may succeed
in reaching those naturalists who, I am sure, are not few in

Seasonal Flower Distribution and the Radiometer
Vagaries
Although apparently so dissimilar, there is an intimate con-
nection between the seasonal order of colour in flowers and the
seeming erratic behaviour of certain radiometers.
Whatever be the cause of the mechanical action of light which
is now exciting so much attention, the kind of light remaining the
same, the experiments show that different surfaces produce dis-
similar effects, the results with pith discs applying to pith only
and being different from those obtained with mica, which strictly
apply to mica alone. This is due in all probability to the differ-
ence in inter-molecular conditions presented by the two sub-
stances. When these conditions are thoroughly understood and
a proper margin allowed for experimental errors, the observations
which seem now at variance will most likely be reconciled. To
acquire the needed knowledge, it is my humble opinion that
some modification of the present method will be required,

The Screw-Propeller in Nature
Now that the question of the best form of the screw as a pro-
peller has become of such importance it is interesting to note
what Nature has done in this direction.
The seed of the ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is provided with a
wing very delicately twisted, and, when the seed falls, the action
of the air upon this screw-like wing causes it to revolve rapidly.
The result is that the seed is kept suspended in the air for a
comparatively long time, and is wafted by the slightest breeze to
a considerable distance from the parent tree. I do not know
that this peculiarity is referred to in any botanical work, but it
very beautifully fulfils the object which characterises more com-
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
pletely the lighter-winged seeds, viz., the dispersion of the seed
beyond the limits of the plant or tree which bears it.
I am not by any means sure that the screw on the ash seed
will not by its own action, independently ol any wind, work itself
away, in its fall, from the perpendicular line. But, when the
wind blows strongly—and it takes a strong wind to blow the
seeds off at all—their range is very extensive.
The seeds hang stubbornly to the tree through the winter
months, reserving themselves for the March gales, of which the
wind-fertilising plants avail themselves so largely.
I should much like to know if any of your readers have ob-
served this screw and studied its pitch, and it would be very
remarkable should it prove that the pitch of this natural screw is
the one which will give the most power to the propeller of a
steamer.
The seeds of the maple and the sycamore have somewhat
similar appendages, but the screw is, in neither case, so marked.
If anyone, at this season, will throw up a stick at the seed
clusters of ash, maple, or sycamore, he will find the seeds come
fluttering to the ground like a cloud of butterflies and alighting
quite as softly on the ground.

The Migration of Species
In Nature, vol. xii. p. 86, I read a communication signed
"W. L. Distant,'' in which the writer states that sea-going ships
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
were frequently visited by both birds and insects.
In confirmation of this fact, I can mention from my own
observation two instances of birds visiting ships in which I was
making the homeward voyage from the West Indies, and one
instance on a voyage to New Zealand, in which the visitor was a
butterfly.
In the first case, the ship being off the Spanish coast, but not
in sight of land, a very handsome bird came on board. It was
a species of dove, blue being the principal colour, with darker
markings. Some of the seamen called it a Spanish dove. It
was caged and taken home by one of the passengers.
In the second case, being in the neighbourhood of Bermuda, a
large flight of a species of swallow settled on the vessel. These
poor birds were in a very exhausted condition, and numbers of
them were captured by a large cat belonging to the ship. The
survivors continued their passage at daybreak next moming.
In the year 186—, on a voyage to New Zealand, we were one
morning visited by a butterfly, there being at the time a lisjht
breeze blowing. My sons made great efforts to capture this inte-
resting stranger, but unfortunately without succe-s, as it fluttered

Conjunction of Jupiter and /3 Scorpii.—Mr. J.
Birmingham, Millbrook, Tuam, writes as follows with
reference to the near approach of Jupiter to the bright
star /3 Scorpii on the morning of Feb. 28.—" The weather
prevented any observation until 19I1. 25 m. Greenwich
M.T., when the western limb of Jupiter had nearly, but
scarcely quite, reached the R.A. of the star. The micro-
meter-wire through the star then just grazed the northern
edge of the planet, and so closely that it could not be said
for certain that there had not been actual contact. Clouds
corning on again soon put an end to the observation."
Allusion was lately made to the above phenomenon in
this column.
Note on Biela's Comet.—It will be remembered that
when, on the appearance of Biela's Comet in 1805, the
similarity of elements to those of the comet of 1772 had
been remarked, it was pointed out by Gauss that the
differences between the orbits, particularly the diminution
of the inclination, could not be accounted for except on
the supposition that in the interval the comet had under-
gone perturbations from one of the larger planets, and
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
the necessary proximity could only have been consistent
with the assumption that several revolutions had been
performed in the interval between 1772 and 1805, as on
the next observation of the comet in the spring of 1826
was proved to have been the case.
If we adopt the elements for 1772 assigned by the late
Prof. Hubbard of Washington in his masterly investiga-
tion on the motion of this comet, we shall find the follow-
ng distances from the orbit of the planet Jupiter :—
True Anomaly. Radius vector. Distance.

157 3° 5"'43 0281
158 O 5-180 0283
+ 160 o 5-327 0344
A true anomaly of 1570 30' corresponds to 645-5 days
after a perihelion passage, and the comet would arrive at
this point of its orbit, which may be taken as that of
nearest proximity to the orbit of Jupiter about 1794-21,
while the planet would be in the same longitude about
1794-43, and it thus appears that it was in the spring of
the year 1794 that the very material changes in the
elements of the comet's orbit were caused by the attrac-
tion of Jupiter. Another near approach of the two bodies
would appear to have taken place towards the end of the
year 1746.

THE NEW GERMAN SCIENTIFIC EXPEDI-

THE Expedition to Northern Siberia, fitted out by
the "Verein fur die Deutsche Nordpolarfahrt in

German North Polar Expedition, and published the excel-
lent account of its results—left Bremen last week. The

zoological and ethnographical expedition overland to the
Obi, which appeared to be less known than the Jenisei.
In this they received the warm support of the highest
scientific authorities at St. Petersburg who were asked for
advice on the subject. Dr. Otto Finsch, Director of the
Zoological Museum at Bremen, was appointed leader of
the expedition, and Dr. Brehm, the well-known author of
"Das Thierleben " and many other natural history works
was selected to accompany him. They were joined by

be necessary for them to abolish in a nearly complete
manner the existing idle fellowships.
In fact the term " Fellow " will cease to be the name for a
successful candidate in an examination, who, as a reward
for his success, receives for a longer or shorter period a
considerable income, and will become the title of one
engaged in University work.
It must not, however, be lost sight of that the abolition
of idle fellowships is only valuable as a means to an end
—that end being the increased efficiency of the teaching
and research in the Universities. On this account it
becomes important to follow out the further changes
which will be entailed by the abolition of idle fellowships.
On the abolition of these fellowships, all the colleges
will be in possession of a large income entirely available
for University purposes. A considerable part of this will
no doubt be at once employed for the buildings and other
permanent structures needed by the Universities, and will
be handed over to the Universities either in the form of a
yearly tax or a share of the college property. Of these two
methods of contribution the former appears on the whole
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
to be attended with the fewest inconveniences, and will
have the further advantage of supplying at once an avail-
able income to the University.
On the most extravagant estimate it seems clear that,
after all the requirements of the University for permanent
buildings, &c, have been satisfied, the available revenues
of the colleges will by no means be exhausted, but a con-
siderable sum will still be left to meet the urgent need of
fresh Fellows to carry on the work of the University.
Ought the money intended for the payment of these
Fellows to be handed over to the University, or left in the
hands of the colleges? Although some advantages might
accrue from handing over the money directly to the Uni-
versity, yet the proposal cannot be entertained. No
Conservative Government could thus despoil the colleges.
The opposition would be too great and not improbably
the whole scheme of reform might be ruined. If it
is admitted that the money is to remain in the hands of
the colleges, a further question arises as to the system
under which the new Fellows are to be elected.
Is their election to be carried on by the colleges on the
old system, or to be more or less directly under the con-
trol of the University? We believe that the value of the
proposed reforms depends greatly upon the answer given
to these questions.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
In dealing with them in a practical way it is neither
possible nor desirable to overlook the fact that a collegiate
system of teaching exists. Were it proposed, while still
leaving the money in the hands of the colleges, to remove
the election of the Fellows completely from their control,
they would feel greatly aggrieved and would offer the
strongest opposition to the scheme. It certainly could
not be looked on as otherwise than a hardship for the
colleges, that they should have no voice in the election of
the men who were to form their governing body.
It must not, however, be overlooked that so long as
Fellows are elected on the present system, a great increase
of efficiency in the teaching staff of the University cannot
be anticipated.
The causes which render the present system unsatis-
factory are for the most part easily detected. In the first
place Fellows are not elected for their efficiency in teach-
ing or in research, but on account of their success in an
examination, a very unsatisfactory test either of their
powers of research or their powers of teaching.
In the second place, the standard requisite to obtain a

teaching, and a much-needed stimulus thereby given to
learning in the Universities.
The remarks of Lord Salisbury on the question of re-
search are quite as liberal as those on the questions of
general education of the University. "The only point,"
he says, " in the connection to which I wish to call atten-
tion is that referring to research. We are of opinion
that the mere duty of communicating knowledge to others
does not fulfil all the functions of a University, and that
the best Universities in former times have been those in
which the instructors, in addition to imparting learning,

How best can research be combined with teaching?
It will probably be found advisable to relieve from all
teaching some of the professors who belong to the highest
grade, and who have shown their capability for research;
but we do not believe that this principle can with any
advantage be generally adopted in the case of young and
untried men. It would appear to be far safer to give
opportunities of research by not demanding too much

teaching work. With a large staff of lecturers it would
not be necessary to demand from each more than two
terms' teaching in the year. With only two terms' work
and the remainder of the year free, ample time would be
given for a teacher, not only to keep up with the progress
of his subject, but also himself to advance it; but this
point might be left for further consideration and expe-
rience.
The research we are anxious for is not confined to the
natural sciences, but embraces all branches of learning,
and we cannot better explain our view in this matter than
by again quoting a passage from Lord Salisbury's speech.
"What I am particularly anxious for," he says, "is that
all branches of culture should have equal encouragement,
and should be regarded not as rivals but as allies in the
great and difficult task of cultivating and developing the
human mind."
SCIENCE AND ART IN IRELAND
rTT H E Royal Dublin Society held a special meeting on
-*¦ Thursday, March 2, to consider the Report of the
Council on Lord Sandon's letter. In the absence of
his Grace the Duke of Leinster, the President of the
Society, the chair was taken by Sir George Hodson, Bart.,
one of the Vice-Presidents. Dr. Steele read the Report
of Council, which concluded with a recommendation that

the Society should sanction the Council's sending a depu-

Majesty's Government :—
i. An assurance that the library, and the collections in
the museums, shall be maintained in Dublin for the use
of the public.
2. That ample accommodation shall be secured for the
members of the Society for the purposes of their meetings,
for their reading rooms, and for their officers ; the whole
being maintained for the Society, and under its own
control.
3. That a suitable apartment as a reading room in
connection with the library shall be provided for the ex-
clusive use of the members of the Society.
4. That the members shall have the privilege, under
reasonable restrictions and conditions, of borrowing books
out of the library.
5. That the Agricultural Department shall be compen-
sated by an equivalent for any space of which it may be
deprived.

a. That the arrangement of the Museum, as well as the
purchase of additions, shall continue to be conducted by
the Academy ; and that adequate provision shall be made
for the continued acquisition of Irish antiquities which
may hereafter be discovered or offered for sale.
b. That the Museum of the Academy, together with
such other Irish antiquities as may be added to it, shall
be for ever kept apart from other collections, and be per-
manently maintained as a Museum of our National Anti-
quities, no portion of its contents being ever removed
from the City of Dublin, unless by permission given under
the seal of the Academy.
c. That the Academy shall be accountable, as at
present, to her Majesty's Treasury, through the Irish
Government, for all sums voted by Parliament, and shall
not be subject, in the conduct of its affairs or the expen-
diture of its grants, to any control on the part of the
Science and Art Department, or any of its officers.

scientific, literary, and antiquarian Society of the country,
the proportional representation proposed to be given to it
on the Board of Visitors (sect. 12 of Lord Sandon's letter),
is altogether inadequate; and the Academy further think
that no paid official of the Science and Art Department
should be eligible to act as a representative on the
Board.
3. That there should be provided in the yearly esti-
mates, as laid before Parliament, instead of the several
sums now annually voted, a sum at least equal to what is
at present voted, to enable the Academy to discharge
more completely its functions as a scientific, literary, and
antiquarian body, by making grants in aid of original
research, by publishing the results of such research, by
maintaining a library specially adapted to assist learned
investigation, and by editing and printing ancient Irish
texts, &c.
SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION AND THE
ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.
ON Wednesday and Thursday last week two separate
deputations from the Council of the British Associa-
tion waited respectively on Mr. Cross and the Lord Pre-
sident of the Council, the Duke of Richmond and Gordon,
both introduced by Dr. Lyon Playfair, and headed by
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the president of the Association, Sir John Hawkshaw.
The object of the deputations was to induce the Govern-
ment to adopt certain recommendations of the Royal
Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advance-
ment of Science.
Dr. Playfair said there were three points in the Reports
of the Science Commission to which they desire to direct
attention—namely, the recommendations as (1) the study
of science in elementary and endowed schools, (2) the en-
dowment of research, (3) the administration by a Minister
of Science and Art.
Sir John Hawkshaw said that the matters which they that
day desired to mention were chiefly treated in the Fifth and
Eighth Reports. He read a memorandum on these points
approved by those he represented. This document set
forth that the Government possessed, through the elemen-
tary schools and through the authorities charged with
framing schemes for endowed schools, the machinery for
insuring scientific teaching. The public schools will
follow the Universities; the Universities in England and
Scotland are about to.be the subjects of inquiry by Com-

372

NA TURE
the circumstances are which affect it, and understand
where pressure can effectively be brought to bear.
The position of science at schools is dependent on—
1. The Public Schools' Commission.
2. The Statutes and Regulations of each School; i.e.,
the Governing Bodies.
3. The Indirect Influence of the Universities and other
Examining Bodies.
4. Head-Masters.
5. Parents.
1. The Public Schools' Commission enforce the teach-
ing of science by requiring (Reg. 3) that " In any exa-
mination of a boy (not being one of the senior boys) in
the school, or in any report of a general examination, the
proportion of marks to be assigned to Natural Science
shall be not less than one-tenth nor more than one-
fourth, as the Governing Body shall think fit." Also that
(Reg.6) "There shall be one Mathematical Master, at the
least, for every 100 boys in the school, and one Science
Master, at the least, for every 200 boys learning Natural
Science in the school." Also that (Reg. 7) " Every boy
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
shall learn Natural Science continuously from his en-
trance into the upper middle form, Div. II., until he
become one of the senior boys in the school." Further,
that (Reg. 8) Senior boys may pursue special subjects
of study and discontinue other subjects for that purpose:
and that (Reg. n) "Any boy in the school who may
evince an aptitude for Natural Science shall have facilities
for that study." Also (Reg. 10), "Any boy entering the
school shall have the opportunity of showing acquaint-
ance with Botany, Physical Geography, or some other
branch of Natural Science."
It is evident that the all-important question here is, who
are senior boys? Regulation 5 says "the Governing
Body shall from time to time determine the point in the
school list above which the boys shall be reckoned as
senior boys for the purposes of these regulations."
These regulations are dated Aug. 4, 1874.
I do not think any reasonable fault can be found with
these regulations from Prof. Roscoe's point of view, unless
he finds fault with Regulation 7, which does not give
natural science equality *' as regards range," with classics
and mathematics. To this I shall recur again.
2. The Statutes of Rugby School order that three
Major Exhibitioners shall each year be elected—to pursue
their studies elsewhere—for general proficiency in the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
studies of the school ; and that four Minor Exhibitioners
shall be elected, for proficiency in Classics, Mathematics,
Natural Science, and Modem Languages respectively.
The Regulations (37) order that " Natural Science shall
be obligatory on every boy in the middle school, and
either Natural Science or German on every boy above
the middle school." Also (40) that" two Major and three
Minor Scholarships shall be given for proficiency in
Classics; one Major and one Minor for proficiency in
Mathematics; one Minor for proficiency in French, and
one in Natural Science." These are open to all boys
between twelve and fifteen years of age.
I think it cannot but be felt that Natural Science has
not been ignored in these regulations; it is not indeed
put on an educational equality with Classics, but it is
respectfully treated.
3. The Universities and other examining bodies affect
us greatly. We at Rugby are principally influenced by
Oxford and Cambridge, and it is of their influence only
that I proceed to say a few words. It is plain that at
the Universities some subjects must be universal, and some

NA TURE
in cases of rare genius in a boy, costs the school a good
deal, not in money, but in efficiency. To get one you
must spoil several. First-rate proficiency in a subject, it
is believed, can only be got when many are working
together in it. Competition is stimulated by numbers.
The success is less brilliant when the racers are few. A
form is somewhat disorganised, it is urged, if some boys
drop Greek, and others drop verses, or composition alto-
gether ; and thereupon many are kept to swell the triumph
of the few. The possible disorganisation is an imaginary
evil, I believe, but a real argument none the less, and
science suffers much at schools from a want of freedom
given to boys to drop some other subjects and pursue it
as a principal study.
Then there is the inevitable silent disparagement of
non-appreciation. Some men have genuine sympathy
with learning of all kinds, and can make others feel that
they respect a learning they themselves do not possess.
But such men are rare. It is too often made plain to
boys who "take to science," that they are regarded as
failures—as we hear of some " ne'er-do-weel" that he has
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
"taken to" sheep-farming in Australia. It is the entire
and transparent honesty of this opinion that makes it so
effective, and this adverse influence, which is deeper than
words, and often in flat contradiction to them, will only
be eliminated by the general growth of public estimation
of science, and by the fruits that education in science
can show. For this we must wait.
5. The last influence is that of parents and the public
generally. From them, as far as I can judge, there is no
trace of a demand for a revolution in education. The
only subjects on which there seems to me to be a strong
and tolerably united opinion, are the postponement of
Greek in the education of young boys, and a desire for
greater weight to be given to arithmetic, good writing,
and geography. The teaching of science is desired,
principally on grounds of utility, not of training; and
choice of the time of introduction of it, the order of the
subjects, &c, the stratification of science, in a word, has
not been considered, except by very few.
Prof. Roscoe thinks science ought to have " educational
equality both in range and time with classics and mathe-
matics." Here I distinctly differ. I maintain, after trial,
that it is unwise, and unscientific from an educational
point of view, to attempt to teach science at school to
boys till they have attained a certain standard of know-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ledge in arithmetic, and a certain power of reasoning
and language, as shown by their attainments in geometry
and Latin. Let science be held before them as a thing to
be enjoyed w en they are older and more advanced. It
is spoiled for them, and they are spoiled for it, by its
being taught them too soon. The dicta of men like
Faraday and Sir John Lubbock, and Roscoe are mis-
leading opinion on this point, and I wish to record my
protest against them. Do Sir John and the Professor
know, have they the slightest idea what the standard of
arithmetic is in the lower forms and among the new boys
of a public school? I will tell them. This was the en-
trance paper I set in Arithmetic last January. By the
Regulations, " No boy shall be admitted who cannot work
sums in Fractions and the Rule of Three."

honourable position in our curriculum. At other schools,
as, for example, the Manchester Grammar School, I
am told that even a larger proportion of the time of the
boys is given to work of this kind; and on the whole I
am inclined to think that, notwithstanding the reluctance
of some of the old foundations to admit the interloper, yet
that the prospects of science in connection with general
education are exceedingly satisfactory and encouraging.
It would be a mistake to attempt to displace classical
studies, as some people seem to wish, in favour of science
or any other subject. It cannot be expected that all boys
should have the same tastes or capabilities. It would be
as much an error to compel a boy, who has shown no
aptitude for science, to devote any large proportion of
his time to that subject, when he might be getting on with
his classics, as it would be to doom another to Latin
prose when his heart was all the time in the laboratory.
The true system I believe to be this. After passing
through a junior school, in which all should be equally
instructed in some branch of natural history or experi-
mental science, boys should then be drafted off into one
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of three departments. There should be(i)a classical
school, in which Latin and Greek should be the staple,
though not to the exclusion of a certain modicum of
mathematics and science; (2) a modern school, in which
mathematics are predominant; and (3) a science school,
in which languages, though subordinate to science, should
not be altogether extinguished. This is very nearly the
system pursued at Clifton, and I can testify to its prac-
tical convenience and success.
As regards the choice of subjects, though I believe
chemistry is pre-eminent in its capacity for developing
certain of the mental powers, I consider that the fullest
advantage is not derived from it, unless it is taught in a
certain way. I hold that teachers of chemistry in schools
are wrong when they set about teaching boys according
to the methods commonly in use in the instruction of
ordinary chemical students. The latter have to apply
their knowledge to practical purposes, and this is not the
prime object to be kept in view in determining the edu-
cational value of a given subject.
And this leads me back to the question of examination
papers. I consider that examiners have as much to learn
as teachers in connection with their respective functions.
At present it is too frequently, " How do you make this?"
or, " What are the properties of that ?" a style of question
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which is good enough in its way, but to answer requires
very little intellectual effort. The preparation for such an
examination is little better than " cram," and is of propor-
tionately small educational value.
If examiners, whether in school or university, would
take more pains in framing their questions so as to extract
not alone that which is in the memory of the candidate,
but to get the product of his brain, I believe great and
important service would be rendered to scientific educa-
tion. William A. Tilden

what appear to be the strict limits of their Commission. It is
with their report ihat I am mainly concerned.
The Commissioners have expressed their opinion that the
rivers Thames and Lea (or Lee, as the word is spelt in their
Report) ought to be abandoned as early as possible, and espe-
cially the former, as sources of supply to London. They regard
the condition of these rivers as hopeless, and point out that an
abundance of spring- and deep-well water can be procured in the
basin of the Thames and within a moderate distance of London;
and they are further of opinion that the metropolis and its
suburbs should be supplied, on the constant system, exclusively
with this palatable and wholesome water.
They believe that within forty miles of St. Paul's a sufficient
volume of deep-well and spiing-water can be obtained for the
present daily wants of the metropolis, but especially point to the
chalk and upper green-sand above the Gault, as the sources of
supply. They state that within thirty miles of London there is
an area of 849 square miles "covered" by these formations, and
that within 40 miles radius the area is 1,597 square miles.
They estimate, to a great extent guided by experiments carried
on during many years under my superintendence, that the portion
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of the annual rainfall upon this large extent of porous rock, which
sinks to reappear in springs and streams, may be taken at six
inches annually, and point out that this amount of infiltration
into the chalk area within thirty miles of the metropolis indicates
the quantity of 202 millions of gallons daily, as the theoretical
maximum supply available from that area. They suggest that
the greater portion of this water, which now escapes in springs
and in the river-beds at the lower levels of the absorbent district
on which it falls, might be abstracted by a sufficient number of
wells sunk below the present spring-heads of the district, and so
constantly drawn upon, that there should always be a void for
the reception of unusual rainfalls below the level at which the
drainage of the district naturally escapes. They incidentally
admit that any water drawn from the subterranean reservoir in
the chalk by artificial means will be at the expense of the streams
which now flow through the valleys in the chalk area, but do not
give even a passing consideration to tie effect upon that area of
abstracting Irom it its ratuial supply of water, and conveying it
—"convey, the wise it call "—to London—should the scheme
they advocate ever be carried into effect.
It can hardly be believed that a proposal such as this, involv-
ing the diversion of the whole of the water from the natural
springs and streams over an area of not less than 440 square
miles—an area larger than that of several English counties—
should have been brought forward without the slightest reference

to what would be the result upon this vast extent of country, the
inhabitants of which are to be sacrificed to the presumed needs
of this overgrown city. It will, I think, come within the pro-
vince of the geologist to point out not only where spring-water
of good quality is to be obtained, but also what will be the effect
of its abstraction upon the districts where it now exists in suffi-
cient abundance to overflow into the streams. It will be for him
to show what will be the effect of producing "a void below the
level at which the drainage of the country naturally escapes ;"
how what are now fertile and even irrigated meadows will be
converted into arid wastes; how watercress beds, now of fabulous
value, will be brought to the resemblance of newly-mended turn-
pike roads; how in such a distiict all exi.-ting wells, many of
them already some hundreds of feet in depth, will be dried, the
mill-streams disappear, and even the canals and navigable rivers
become liable to sink and be lost in their beds. And these
results would, If the scheme were carried out, not be confined to
some single spot, but would extend over hundreds of square
miles.
It may perhaps be thought that I am exaggerating the size of
the area, the natural water-supply of which it is proposed to

by the Commissioners. Omitting these two, the average is
3 780, which is still far higher than any of the others.
If we refer to the headings Organic Carbon and Organic
Nitrogen, there can be little doubt of the superiority of the Kent
Company's water, but judging merely from the statistics under
the awful heading of "Previous Sewage Contamination," that
of the River Companies seems the purest.
Why the source of supply from the two rivers should be con-
demned as hopeless it is hard to determine. This startling
recommendaiion to give up the supplies of water on which
London for centuries has depended, is brought forward just at a
time when the most strenuous efforts are being made to purify
the rivers Thames and Lea, and but a few years after the Com-
missioners on the Water Supply of the Metropolis, within whose
proper sphere this question lay, had reported that with perfect
filtration and efficient measures taken for excluding from them
the sewage and other polluting matter, these rivers will afford
water which will be perfectly wholesome and of suitable quality
for the supply of the metropolis.
It is not for me to enter into the chemical part of this ques-
tion, but I may venture to express a doubt whether considerably

more might not be done by increased reservoirs for subsidence,
and by artificial aeration of the water, in addition to filtration,
so as to carry still farther the oxidation of any organic matter it
may chance to contain.
I have less hesitation in strongly insisting on the fact that,
irrespective of the New River water, the metropolis is already
supplied with 9,000,000 gallons per diem, or at least 2\ gallons
per head, of the deep-well water so highly commended, a quan-
tity which would seem amply sufficient for dietetic and culinary
purposes. I am, moreover, of opinion that the difficulty of dis-
tributing this water over the whole area by means of a second
service distinct from that of the water for ordinary domestic
purposes, though great, is by no means insurmountable. Even
were the waters of the Thames and Lea unfit for drinking pur-
poses, it is very far from being the case, that London is in the
same plight as Coleridge's " Ancient Mariner," with—
"Water, water everywhere,
Nor any drop to drink."
Enough is already there for all culinary and dietetic purposes,
could it but be distributed ; and to lay out incalculable sums of
money and inflict incalculable mischief, in order to import che-
mically pure water with which to lay the dust in our streets, and
to flush our sewers, seems "a multiplying improvement in mad-
ness, and use upon use in folly." We might almost as well
import wine for the purpose; and in that case the Commissioners
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
might find a historical parallel in the proclamation of Jack
Cade :—" Here, sitting upon London Stone, I charge and
command, that of the City's cost, the conduits run nothing but
claret wine the first year of our reign."
As deeply interested in the water-power and general pros-
perity of one of the chalk valleys within the fated radius of thirty
miles, I may have spoken strongly on this question, and may
not unfairly be accused of having done so from interested
motives. No one, however, can submit silently to an insidious
attack upon the property which he is fairly entitled to hold; and
after carrying on experiments, for upwards of twenty years, as
to the percolation of water to the underground springs in a chalk
area, I may claim some experience in such a question, and much
doubt whether my judgment is seriously distorted. Even should
the abstraction of water be spread over a much larger area than
has been supposed, so as to reduce the amount conveyed away
from any particular district; or even should the gross quantity re-
quired prove less than supposed, it may be left to any one who will
take the trouble to investigate the matter, to determine whether
the effects if wider spread, or somewhat diminished in intensity,
would be much less injurious. Any injury from this cause would

axinite. The rocks near the Gurnard's H .id ate almost identical
with those of Mount's Bay. The crjstalline pyroxenic rocks
and metamorpbic slaies of the St. Ives district exactly resemble
those of Penzance. The greenstones between St. Erth and St,
Stephen's are probably altered ash-beds or hardened hornblendic
slates; unlike the hornblendic and augitic rocks of the other
districts, they do not occur in the immediate vicinity of granite,
but elvan courses are always found near them. The percentage
of silica in the two series of rocks is nearly constant; the horn-
blende slates contain about 10 per cent, less silica than
the crystalline pyroxenic rocks, and there is an excess of
iron oxides to nearly the same extent, their composition
in other respects being very similar. The Killas is an

structure to contraciion due to loss of heat while cooling, but
differ in their explanation of cross jointing and spheroidal frac-
ture. In this paper it is sought to show that the principle
proved by Mr. Mallet to be the explanation of the columnar
structure is capable of a wider application. After a brief notice
of some instances of columnar structure, the author described

and often mistaken for it; also the tabular jointing of rocks ; a
peculiir form of this, where most of the segments are of a flat-
tened convexo-concave form; spheroidal structure and cup-and-
ball structure. He showed by examples that Prof. Thomson's
explanation of spheroidal structure was inadequate, and gave
reasons for considering all these structures to be due to con-
traction. He also discussed more particularly the cup-and-ball
structure, giving reasons for thinking that the spheroidal and the
horizontal fissures were often to some extent independent of each
other.

UNIVERSITY REFORM
THE discussion in the House of Lords on the second
reading of the Oxford University Bill cannot be
said to have been satisfactory. Those who took part in
the debate were, almost without exception, Oxford men
with high honours; and they evidently represented the
opinions of the majority of Oxford residents. It is,
indeed, a singular circumstance that there should be
among the peers so large a proportion of persons who
have gained first-classes, and who have themselves held
"idle fellowships ;" a proportion greater than can be
found in the House of Commons. But the experience
contributed by them, however valuable, ought not to have
monopolised the whole discussion of the matter in a
legislative assembly. Such experience is of the nature
of one-sided evidence, which should be heard and weighed
before a decision is reached; but which cannot be per-
mitted to substitute itself for a thorough discussion of a
subject of national importance. This aspect of the
debate is the more to be regretted, because it will tend to
encourage the feeling, which seems to be already pre-

dominant at Oxford, that the limited vision of the present
race of University residents, together with their own
pecuniary interests, is to determine the course of acade-
mical reorganisation. The hopes raised by Lord Salis-
bury's first speech will be dashed to the ground, if
such petty matters as the difference between the
legislative functions of convocation and congregation,
the influence of the parochial clergy on either body, or
the period during which an "idle fellowship" should be
tenable, are thrust forward as the supreme considerations.
These subjects, no doubt, require to be discussed and
settled, once and for all ; and it is, perhaps, an omission
that they have not found a place in the Government
measure. But no misfortune would be graver than if it
were to go to the country, as the Liberal peers seem to
wish, that the Bill does not contain principles of reform,
in comparison with which these details sink into their
proper insignificance.
Lord Salisbury's speech was welcomed, certainly by
men of science, and we believe also by all those whose
ideal of a university is not confined to what they learned
during their adult school-days at Oxford or Cambridge,
because he unhesitatingly announced two new principles,
upon which the whole merits of the scheme turn. He
proposed that the University should be endowed at the

expense of the colleges, and that scientific research should
take its place in the University by the side of religion and
learning. Now, these two main principles were entirely
disregarded in the discussion of last Thursday; or, when
they were referred to, were "damned with faint praise."
The Archbishop of Canterbury, whose speech was, on the
whole, worthy of his position, professed himself ignorant
of the precise meaning to be attached to the word
"research ;" as if there had not been, during the last
three years, abundance of discussion on the subject in
the press, and as if it had not been defined in the report
of a Royal Commission. Both Lord Carlingford and the
Earl of Morley reproduce the old argument, which to
those familiar with the topic has long ago been worn

threadbare, that the endowment of teaching professors is
the only endowment of research which is either desirable
or possible. It is not necessary in these pages to show
how entirely is this objection founded upon ignorance. It
is enough to observe that those very persons who are the
most ardent advocates of the present system of awarding

are the Inns of Court. From the date of the foun-
dation of the first college our knowledge becomes more
definite. The original statutes have been preserved,
and were published to the world by the University Com-
missioners about twenty years ago. The evidence, there-
fore, of the intentions of the early founders of fellowships
is abundant, and it is also decisively clear. It was, no
doubt, desired that the study of Theology should be
supreme, and ample provision was made for divine wor-
ship ; but it must be recollected that in those days
Theology included Law, and did not exclude Natural
Philosophy. But what the founders had foremost in
view, as might easily be shown by copious extracts from
their statutes, was not religion, or even education, but
advanced study. The few earliest colleges make no
reference at all to the endowment of teaching. Their
fellowships were established "for the support of indigent
scholars in the University of Oxford, who are bound to
study and make progress in the divers Sciences and
Faculties." The function of teaching was left to be per-
formed by the University, and all those who had taken

the higher degrees enjoyed the privilege, as they were
under the obligation, of giving instruction. "To study,
not to teach, was the business of the Fellows. The
founder of Queen's College has even expressly stated
that he intends his benefaction to relieve his Fellows
from the necessity of teaching." The full period of
study required for the degree of Doctor lasted for thirteen
or nineteen years, varying in the different faculties; and
the fellowships were intended to support poor students
during this long season of probation. Nor must it be
supposed that Theology and the Classics were the only
subjects meant to be encouraged. Many of the founders
made provision for the study of medicine; at New Col-
lege Astronomy is specially mentioned ; and William of
Waynflete, in the statutes of Magdalen, expressly pre-
scribes Natural Philosophy as one of the three depart-
ments of knowledge which the Fellows were to cultivate.
Other instances of a similar nature might be quoted ; but
nothing further is required to prove what the colleges
themselves will scarcely admit, that the fellowships were
given not as prizes to stimulate clever boys, nor as sub-
sidies for academical teachers, but to promote mature
study. The appeal, therefore, to the intentions of the
founder does not lie in the mouth of the advocates of the
existing order of things, but is one of the strongest argu-

from 30 to 150 miles, runs the Cordilleras range of

according to Strzelecki, 6,500 feet above the sea, but
according to the later observations of Clarke 7,175 feet.
From the base of this range the country extends in a

the great central wilds of South Australia, and the
regions watered by the Darling, the Lachlan, and the

the ocean steamers and coast towns.
Another point of similarity between the mother-country
and her daughter, dates from the far-off ages of Geologic
time; for Mr. Clarke and other geologists have clearly
demonstrated that the coal-beds of New South Wales
and of Britain were elaborated in Nature's workshop
during the same Geological period ; and on comparison it
will be found that the general succession of the members
of the Carboniferous series in the North of England and
Scotland have their equivalents, as nearly as possible, at
the Antipodes. This may be accidental, but it is at any
rate a striking illustration of the prevalence of similar con-

be cut off from the conclusions, now almost proved by

glacial epoch, and second, that this epoch should rather
be called the last glacial epoch, as there have been
similar ones throughout geologic time. This last con-

Sport in Abyssinia, on the Mareb and Tackazzee. By
the Earl of Mayo. (London: John Murray, 1876.)
THE Earl of Mayo seems to have published this book to
show intending sportsmen in Abyssinia how not to do it.
His expedition, organised solely for sport, was rather an
unfortunate one. Very little sport was obtained by the
author, and ere he had well set to work, he was taken so
ill that he had suddenly to return to Massowah to catch
a homeward-bound steamer. The work contains some
shrewd observations on Abyssinian people and affairs,
and will no doubt be appreciated by sportsmen.

The Use of the Words "Weight" and "Mass"
In a letter with the above heading published in Nature, vol.
xiii. p. 325, Mr. Bottomleyhas recommended that the ambiguity
of the word weight shall be avoided by using the phrase "the
gravity of a pound " when we mean the downward force due to
the earth's attraction upon a pound weight.
The ambiguity against which Mr. Bottomley wishes to guard
is'a very real one. Not to speak of common usage, which
aliows three meanings of the word weight to be loosely inter-
mingled, we have two of these meanings adopted into scientific
nomenclature. The universal practice in chemistry is to employ
the word weight to signify mass, and anyone may satisfy him-
self that this use of the word could not be dispensed with in
that science by making the attempt to substitute other forms of

t xpression for the convenient words weight, heavy, light, heavier,
lighter, as used by chemists. On the other hand, physicists
have generally employed the term to signify a force, and the best
writers on mechanics are careful to avoid using it to express
mass.
But I fear Mr. Bottomley's remedy, if adopted, would intro-
duce quite as serious, perhaps a more serious, ambiguity. Gravity
is an acceleration. When we say that gravity is less in a balloon
or in a mine than at the surface of the earth, or greater at
Glasgow than at Manchester, we are speaking of alterations of g
—the acceleration due to the earth's attraction ; and it would
create confusion to employ this word to designate forces also.
But a practice which I adopted in lecturing on mechanics In
Queen's College, Galway, many years ago seems to meet the
difficulty, and may perhaps recommend itself to other teachers.
It is to use the word gravitation in the proposed sense.
If this were done, gravity at Glasgow would mean an acce-
leration; the gravitation of a kilogramme there would be a
force ; and weight would continue a word of doubtful import, to
be judged of by the context, sometimes used for a force, some-
times for a mass, and sometimes for those pieces of metal which
are employed as measures in weighing (as in the phrases "a set
of weights," "a gramme weight "). In further support of my
suggestion, it may be observed that the proposed use of the sub-
stantive gravitation follows legitimately in the English language
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
from the established meaning of its correlative, the verb gra-
vitate.
I would wish to take this opportunity of also recommending a
prefix which I have found of the utmost service both to students
by assisting them to acquire clear conceptions with ease, and to
myself. We use the prefix hyper placed before the name of any
metrical weight, as hyper decigramme, hyper-gramme, hyper-
hektogramme. hyper-kilogramme, hyper-tonne, to indicate those
forces of the absolute metrical series which are slightly larger in
amount (about 2 per cent, more) than the gravitation at the
earth's surface of the decigramme, gramme, hektogramme, &c,
respectively.
When a student has to use weights as forces, as he must in the
laboratory, he should be trained Irom the beginning to think of
them in their relation to the neighbouring absolute forces. For
instance, if he uses a hektogramme to exert a pressure, he should
p
be encouraged to think of it rather as — ths of a hyper-hekto-
grammc (which is a force) than as a hektogramme (which is
more properly a mass). This will also keep prominently before
his mind that the amount of the pressure depends on the station

In reply to your correspondent's question as to which of the

scientific definition of a mineral, adopted in most mineralogies,
is as follows : a mineral is any inorganic, homogtneous, natural
substance.

This definition obviously includes water, which is accordingly
always described in books on mineralogy; and the fact of water
being a liquid at ordinary temperatures cannot of course exclude
it from the li*t of minerals. Indeed, in some mineralogies,
gases—such as carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, and even the air
—are described as minerals. Water, like many other minerals,
can exist in more than one form ; thus, if the temperature of our
globe were much lower than it is, we should only have water in
the form of the transparent crystalline solid, known as ice, which
—like other minerals, such a? sulphur, metallic lead, metallic
mercury, &c.—has its own particular point of fusion; thus:
sulphur melts at 226° F., water at 320, mercury at 39°. All
these substances still further resemble one another in their capa-
bility of beinjj converted into a gaseous form, at certain fixed
temperatures. These facts —with many o'.heri—prove water to
be as much a mineral as cilcite or gypsum. E. G. C.

Mr. Wilson thinks that any man of science is misleading
public opinion on this subject. . This is a serious charge,
but as it rests on a misconception, I remain convinced
that in the long run public opinion will endorse our
views.
It is out of my power to tell Mr. Wilson whose business
it is to make the change to a better state of things, which
he himself feels to be necessary, for he admits that the
new examination is adverse to scientific education. I do,
however, feel strongly that unless the authorities of our
great schools and the examining Boards set earnestly to
work to introduce this new discipline and give it (as
many of them to their honour are now beginning to do) a
fair field and no favour, the beneficial influence which
these schools have had on English education, must soon

we anxiously wait.
The negative evidence (which of course must be re-
ceived with the greatest caution in palaeontology) of the
absence of remains of any of these animals in the true
Miocene or Pliocene deposits of North America, indi-
cates that the race became extinct at least in that land,
though it possibly may have emigrated elsewhere, and
perhaps in Asia, may have laid the foundation of that
family which first appears in the Old World under the
more familiar aspect of typical Proboscideans. While,
however, there are no grounds for assuming that the
latter were derived directly from the Eocene Bathmodons
and Uintatheriums, it is not too much to look upon these

gives the name of Dinocerata, while Cope, who formerly
included them in the Proboscidea, and placed Bathmodon
and its allies in the Perissodactyla, has recently formed an
order called Amblypoda, containing two suborders, of
which Dinocerata is one, and Panlodonta {Patlnnodon

The tertiaries of South America have yielded some
very remarkable forms of mammalian life, the nature and
affinities of which have greatly puzzled all zoologists who

in some characters somewhat aberrant. The articulation
of the fibula with the calcaneum is an Artiodactyle, or
perhaps generalised character. The teeth ally it to
Palaeotherium and Rhinoceros. Homalodontotlierium
from the banks of the River Gallegos, South-east Pata-
gonia, is known by the teeth alone, which, though very
generalised, are on the whole rninocerotic. Nesodon,

NATURE
To begin with fishes : we will take as our first example
the very beautiful genus Beryx, a fish not unlike our sea-
bream, found widely distributed through the deep seas, and
extending to about 400 on each side of the equator. Like
the perch or the sea-bream, it is a greatly specialised fish;
the head is immensely large, the bony rays supporting the
fins hard and unjointed, the ventral fins or represen-
tatives of the hind limbs situated just behind the head,
under the throat, the operculum curiously ornamented, and
the air-bladder completely shut off from the gullet ; thus
differing very markedly from a more generalised fish such
as the herring or carp, in which the head is proportion-
ally much smaller, the fin-rays soft and jointed, the
ventral fins far back, the operculum not ornamented, and
the air-bladder communicating by a duct with ,the oeso-
phagus.
We now know that at depths greater than five or six
hundred fathoms, the sea-bottom is to a great extent com-
posed of a very fine greyish-white mud, sticky when first
removed from the water, but afterwards hardening into a
delicate friable stone, not at all unlike chalk. This mud,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
which is largely made up of shells of the minute marine
organism Globigerina, forms the bed of thousands of
square miles of sea in which Beryx lives, and there can
be no doubt that when the fish dies it sinks to the bottom,
and, its soft parts being destroyed, becomes gradually
imbedded in the soft mud, there to remain until the present
sea-bottom is upheaved and becomes dry land.
Now, as a matter of archaeological evidence, what is
known of the history of Beryx and of the source whence
it proceeded? Naturally it is useless to seek for such
evidence except in deposits formed under like conditions to
those in which the fish lives at the present day. Through
the whole of the Pliocene and Miocene epochs no deep-sea
formations are known, but in the middle of the Eocene
period—a time so remote that tropical plants flourished
on the banks of the Thames, and crocodiles abounded in
this country—we are acquainted with an extensive deep-
sea deposit, the Nummulitic limestone, which, besides the
fossil giving it its name, contains large quantities of
Globigerina, in all essential respects like that of the pre-
sent day. In this formation are found two forms closely
allied to Beryx, but with such slight differences as to
receive different generic names; these are known as
Acanus and Pristigasler. On passing from the Eocene
or lowest tertiary to the chalk or uppermost secondary

formation, which bears the closest possible resemblance
to the modern Atlantic mud—the two may, in fact, be
looked upon as belonging to one continuous series of
deposits—we find an actual Beryx, a fish differing
no more from the modern Berices than the various
modern species of Beryx do from one another.
This fossil, owing to the fineness of the chalk-forming
mud in which it was buried, is so perfectly preserved,
that all the details of structure of its hard parts, even to
the ornamentation of the scales, can be compared with
those in the recent fish; and in this way the most con-
clusive evidence is obtained that the differences which
separate it from its modern relatives arc of no greater
importance than those by which the recent species of
Beryx are distinguished from one another.
Thus we have positive evidence that a fish altogether
like the Beryx of the present day, existed millions of years
ago, before the Alps, the Himalayas, or the Rocky Moun-
tains were upheaved, and has continued to live ever since.
In face of these facts we cannot but conclude that the
modern Beryx is derived from that of the chalk, and that

most part to fishes and crustaceans. The author pointed
out the geological evidence in-favour of great terrestrial
oscillations as explained by Prof. Ramsay, whereby the
bed of the Silurian sea in our area came to be raised into
land with wide lakes and inland seas. He showed that
the beginnings of the movements which led to those
results could be traced back a considerable way into the
Silurian period, that over large tracts the Silurian deposits
had been upraised before the close of that period, and
that the oscillations continued during the accumulation
of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, as indicated by the
coarse conglomerates, the great mass of the deposits, and
the unconformabilities traceable in them. Recent detailed
work of the Geological Survey has brought to light the
fact that this lower division of the Old Red Sandstone
attains an almost incredible thickness. In Lanarkshire and
Ayrshire Mr. B. N. Peach has found it to measure 15,ooofeet.
In Perthshire, from the combined surveys of Mr. Peach and
Mr.- R. L. Jack, it has been ascertained to reach a depth
of more than 19,000 feet. But the author has found that

thickness rises above 20,000 feet. And yet in no case is
its top actually seen, since it has either been removed by
denudation, or buried under some more recent unconform-
able formation. Nor is its base to be found, since along the
flank of the Grampians a great fault runs from the North
Sea at Stonehaven to the estuary of the Clyde, with the effect
of throwing the strata of the Old Red Sandstone on end,
sometimes for a distance of two miles from the line of the
dislocation. The amount of displacement must be in
some places not less than 5,000 feet, as indicated by the
position of occasional outliers of conglomerate on the
Highland side of the fault. One of the most striking
features in the formation is the enormous development of
its contemporaneous volcanic rocks. These are underlaid
in Kincardineshire by about 5,000 feet of sandstones and
shales, and they pass under the grey flags and conglome-
rates of Forfar, and an upper series of red and purple
sandstones. They consist of thick sheets of various por-
phyries with beds of tuff and enormous masses of coarse
volcanic conglomerates. Zones of grey flagstones, includ-
ing the well-known beds of Carmylie near Arbroath, are
intercalated in them. In the Ocnil Hills, according to
the measurements of Mr. B. N. Peach, this volcanic
zone reaches a depth of not less than 6,500 feet. It runs
from the sea-coast at Uunottar through the chain of the

Sidlaw and Ochil Hills to near Stirling. It reappears
south of the Forth, in the Pentland chain, and stretches
south-westwards in great force across Lanarkshire and
Ayrshire. The author then alluded to the fossils hitherto
noticed in this part of the Old Red Sandstone in different
parts of Britain, pointing out the contrast they present to
those of the preceding Silurian rocks. He showed that
in Forfarshire the well-known crustaceans and fishes had
been obtained from strata, lying not as hitherto supposed
at the base of the system, but several thousand feet
higher, and that the fish-bed found by Mr. Mitchell in
Kincardineshire, and supposed by Sir Roderick Murchison
to indicate from its Acanthodian forms an approach to
the middle Old Red Sandstone, really lay below the
position of the Turin flagstones so well explored by Mr.
Powrie.
The so-called "Middle" Old Red Sandstone is not
known certainly to exist anywhere else in Britain than in
the north of Scotland. This subdivision was introduced
by Sir R. Murchison, and is based wholly on the evidence
from fossils. It presents a remarkably distinct series of

up with sandstones, conglomerates, and breccias. The
red stain of these deposits, occasional pseudomorphs of
rock-salt and layers of gypsum, combined with ripple-
marks and sun-cracks seem, as Prof. Ramsay has sug-
gested, to indicate the concentration of the saline waters
which filled these basins; while further evidence of the
unwholesome nature of the water may be indicated by
the general paucity of fossils in the strata, and by the
immense numbers of well-preserved fishes which are
sometimes met with crowded into a small space, as if they
had come from fresher water elsewhere, and had been
inclosed and killed in scattered pools. The peculiar
breccias and brecciated conglomerates of the Upper Old
Red Sandstone have been compared to some recent
Glacial deposits, and the resemblance has been pointed
out between the form of the stones in these deposits, and
those in common boulder-clay. It should be noted also
that in many cases these breccias occur in old valleys,
and bear many of the characters of valley-moraines.
Such are those to the east of Ullswater, and those which
flank, and in some places penetrate the Lammermuir

Hills. In the latter district worn dome-shaped bosses of
rock underlying the breccias recall the aspect of true
roches moutontu'es. Another glacial feature is suggested
by the basin-shaped hollows (apparently sometimes true
rock-basins) in which the deposits lie. Further indica-
tions of ice are given by the remarkable patches of
angular and rounded stones scattered through the red
sandstones of Arran, the occurrence and position of which
may be accounted for on the supposition that they are
portions of shore-gravel, which have been frozen and
transported in cakes of floating-ice.
Indications of terrestrial disturbance during the accu-
mulation of the Upper Old Red Sandstone in Scotland
are furnished by the Lammermuir Hills. Towards the
close of the period, and thence through the deposition of
the Lower Carboniferous rocks, volcanic action which
seems to have been quiescent for a long interval, broke
out again over the south of Scotland. To this period
belongs the chain of old lavas and tuffs which may be
traced from the mouth of the Nith eastwards by Lang-
holm and the Tarras Water, to the head of the Slitrig
Valley, and through the plain of the Tweed as far north-
wards as the Whiteadder. The Garlton Hills, Campsie
Fells, and the ranges of hills which run down Renfrew-

into Bute, the Cumbrays and Arran mark a prolonged
series of volcanic eruptions during this same period.
Probably the terraced hills of Lome are of similar age.
Traces of contemporaneous volcanic action occur likewise
in the Upper Old Red Sandstone of the north of Scotland,
and form a remarkable feature in the cliffs of Hoy, one of
the Orkney Islands.
The author brought forward evidence to show that
while the Upper Old Red Sandstone was being deposited
in the British area, there existed outside that area a sea in
which some of the characteristic corals, brachiopods, and
other organisms of the time of the Carboniferous Lime-
stone already existed. He pointed out the intercalation
of limestone bands in the Red Sandstone series in Arran
and elsewhere, a long way below the base of the Cement-
stone group which underlies the Carboniferous Lime-
stone. These calcareous bands, full of species of fossils
which are familiar in the Carboniferous Limestone, seem
to indicate that while, on the whole, the Upper Old Red
Sandstone, and the red strata at the base of the Carbon-
iferous system were deposited under conditions unfavour-

These experiments show how conveniently and accu-
rately this instrument can be used as a photometer. By
balancing a standard candle on one side against any
source of light on the other, the value of the latter in
terms of a candle is readily shown; thus in the last
experiment the standard candle 48 inches off is balanced
by a gas-flame 113 inches off. The lights are therefore
in the proportion of 48s to 1132, or as 1 to 5^. The gas-
burner is therefore equal to 5J candles.
By interposing screens of water or plates of alum, and
so cutting off the dark heat, the actual luminosity is
measured. In addition to this, by interposing coloured
glasses or solutions, any desired colours can be measured
either against the total radiation from a candle, its lumi-

nous rays, or any desired colour. One coloured ray can
be balanced against another coloured ray, by having
differently coloured screens on either side.
The variations in the luminosity of a "standard"
candle will cease to be of importance. Any candle may
be taken ; and if it be placed at such a distance from the
apparatus that it will give a uniform deflection, say of
100 divisions, the standard can be reproduced at any sub-
sequent time; and the burning of the candle may be
tested during the photometric experiments by taking the
deflection it causes from time to time, and altering its
distance, if needed, to keep the deflection at 100
divisions.
If the pith bar in this instrument be blacked on alter-
nate halves, an impetus given by a ray of light always
acts in the same direction of movement. A candle causes
it to spin round very rapidly until the suspending fibre is
twisted up, and the rotation is stopped by the accumu-
lated torsion.
By arranging the apparatus so that the black and white
surfaces are suspended on a pivot instead of by a silk
fibre, the interfering aclion of torsion is removed, and the
instrument will rotate continuously under the influence of
radiation. To this instrument the author has given the
name of the " Radiometer." It consists of four arms of
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
very fine glass, supported in the centre by a needle-point,
and having at the extremities thin discs of pith lamp-
blacked on one side, the black surfaces all facing the same
way. The needle stands in a glass cup, and the arms
and discs are delicately balanced so as to revolve with
the slighest impetus.
In the " Proceedings of the Royal Society" last year,
the author gave a brief account of some of the earlier
experiments with these instruments. In the present paper
he enters very fully into the various phenomena presented
by them, and gives Tables showing the number of revo-
lutions made by the radiometer when exposed to a con-
stant source of light removed different distances from the
instrument. The law is that the rapidity of revolution is
inversely as the square of the difference between the
light and the instrument.
When exposed to different numbers of candles at the
same distance off, the number of revolutions in a given
time are in proportion to the number of candles, two
candles giving twice the rapidity of one candle, and
three, three times, &c. ,.,,,,

of vast volumes of water from the deep wells at Deptford,
Thames Head, Caterham, Canterbury, Watford, Tring, or
Lichfield, and it is singular that Mr. Evans should have
overlooked the fact that moisture is supplied to growing
plants from above and not from below. However nume-
rous the wells of a given district may be, the rain must
still fall upon the surface of, and soak through, the land
before it can reach them.
As the dry-weather flow of the Thames even above
Teddington lock is 600 millions of gallons daily, it would
be waste of time to discuss seriously the possibility of
canals and navigable rivers sinking into their beds in
consequence of the abstraction of about one-eighth of
that volume from springs and deep wells in that portion
of the river basin. With regard to the water-cress
interest, it is true that the Rivers Commissioners have not
been so deeply impressed as Mr. Evans with the stupen-
dous importance of this department of Thames agri-
culture, but it can scarcely be doubted that a wealthy
city, containing 4,000,000 of inhabitants, would be able

and willing to pay for any damage which it might inflict
upon this or any other branch of industry.
The two most disgusting impurities revealed by the
microscope in Thames water, as delivered for dietetic
purposes in London, are the fibres of partially digested
flesh meat, and those of variously coloured rags. The
presence of these objects in our potable water clearly in-
dicates the two chief kinds of insoluble polluting matter
cast into the Thames, although chemical analysis cannot
always trace to its sources the dissolved animal and vege-
table impurities which it finds accompanying these in-
soluble materials. The question raised, therefore, is
simple enough :—Shall the inhabitants of this "over-
grown city," as Mr Evans contemptuously terms it, drink
the pure spring water which nature offers them in singular
abundance in the Thames valley, or shall they not be
permitted to taste this sparkling beverage until the paper
manufacturers, in the exercise of what they call their
rights, have washed their filthy rags in it, and half a
million of people have polluted it by their drainage?
It is remarkable that whilst Mr. Evans shows so much
consideration, in his presidential address, for the pockets
of the watercress-growers, he has so little to bestow upon
the inhabitants of the overgrown city, for he does not
hesitate to propose that the latter should encounter the

expense of two separate water services—one (pure) for
dietetic, and a second (polluted) for other domestic pur-
poses. Now, leaving out of consideration altogether the
risk of the polluted water being often used for dietetic
purposes instead of the pure, and the enormous cost and
inconvenience of laying and maintaining a new set of
water-mains throughout the hundreds of miles of London
streets ; the supply of each house with a new water service,
together with the necessary alterations of the old pipes,
could not cost, on the average, less than 4/. In February
last 523,801 houses were supplied with water by the eight
metropolitan companies, and we have consequently here
an expense of more than 2,000,000/. Surely a very small
fraction of this sum would suffice to buy up any injured
watercress-growers, even at " fabulous " prices.
In their sixth report, the Rivers Commissioners of 1868
state that the basin of the Thames, including that of its
tributary, the Lea, is upwards of 5,000 square miles in
extent. Rather more than one half of this area, including
the oolitic and cretaceous formations, is covered by a

conclusion that the relative intensity of the blue and red
end of the solar spectrum is subject to great variations,
variations which do not seem to stand in a simple ref-
lation to the hygroscopic state of the atmosphere or to
barometric pressure. My results, while entirely confir-
matory of those of Vogel, point to the fact that in the
higher regions of the Himalayas, and at the season the
observations were made, atmospheric absorption takes
place chiefly in the red end of the spectrum. The blue
end of the solar spectrum, even when the light of the sun
has passed through a cloud, is remarkably bright.
The following extract from my note-book will place this
fact beyond doubt. The observations were conducted at
Simla with a spectroscope of eight prisms of about 6o°.
The direct sunlight was reflected by means of a small
mirror into the slit. The slit was generally adjusted until
one line between Dj and D2was distinctly seen. As far as
I could judge, all the lines, but not more than those given
in Angstrom's map, were seen. The rainy season had
just begun, but had not yet appeared in the violent way it
did after my departure from Simla:—

June 27, 8 a.m.—B beautifully shaded. Light visible in
the blue as far as wave-length 4040, and most likely
further, but the telescope cannot be moved to greater
deviation.
9 AM.—Space beyond B closes up, while in the blue
the spectrum is as visible as before.
Red end closes up. Blue perfectly visible.
11.15 A.M.—The red closed up still more. The blue as
clear as before.
The sky is beautifully blue, but a slight halo seen round
the sun.
July 3, 5.30 p.m.—The atmospheric lines near D seen
distinctly. The blue is exceptionally clear and visible as
far as H. Sky rather cloudy, and halo round the sun.
6.30 p.m.—Sun very near horizon. Spectrum seen from
C to G.
In judging on the visibility of the spectrum, it should be
borne in mind that, owing to the great number of prisms,
a great part of the absorption in the blue was due to the
glass, and that, therefore, owing to the great dispersion in
the blue and instrumental absorption, the blue was seen
under peculiar disadvantage. The above are only a few
out of many observations. I have observed the passage
of a cloud in front of the sun without any apparent effect

I was at the same time struck by the fact that the peculiar
redness of the clouds in the evening, which we observe so
often in our climates, was only rarely seen, and when seen
the colour was rather yellow than red. On making this
remark to a friend competent to judge, and who through
a repeated sojourn in Simla was enabled to form an
opinion, I heard that the redness of the sky at sunset
was often and beautifully seen at the end of, and after the
rainy season.
I now pass to a few observations which I have made in
Upper Thibet, a country which lies beyond the range of
the rainy season. The observations all point to the
remarkable clearness in the blue. As I have said, the
hygroscopic state of atmosphere, as measured by the wet
and dry bulb or barometric pressure, cannot alone
account for all the phenomena. I find, for instance, that
the presence of vegetation affects the atmospheric
absorption in a remarkable degree. In the Kyan
Chu plain, for instance, the plateau on which I ob-
served the mirage described in Nature (vol. xiii.

VISIT OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY TO THE
ROYAL ARSENAL
IN response to an invitation from its president, Prof.
Abel, F.U.S., the chemist of the War Department,
nearly 500 Fellows of the Chemical Society visited the
Royal Arsenal at Woolwich on Tuesday last. The presi-
dents of most of the learned societies, together with other
eminent men of science, were included in Mr. Abel's
liberal invitation, so that during the day a constant stream
of visitors flowed through the interesting workshops at
Woolwich.
Beyond the ordinary attractions of the establishment,'
Mr. Abel had arranged to demonstrate the more import-
ant applications of science to warfare, and among these
were included some experiments with gun-cotton and
other explosives, the study of which he has made pecu-
liarly his own. Indeed the most attractive part of the
programme from a scientific point of view was that carried
out on the outskirts of the arsenal in the vicinity of the
proof butts, where operations commenced by the firing
of the big 80-ton gun. Col. Younghusband, F.R.S.,
R.A., the Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, as
well as other heads of departments, had entered warmly

into the spirit of the visit, and took considerable pains
that every opportunity should be given the Fellows of
witnessing the capabilities of this monster weapon. A
charge of 250 lbs. of gunpowder, the grains of which mea-
sured nearly two inches cube, was introduced into the
gun, and then the heavy bolt, or projectile, weighing
1,260 lbs. was rammed home. Those who were privileged
to enter the chronoscope room, which is so small unfortu-
nately, that scarcely a score of visitors could find room in
it, were gratified with a sight of Boulanger's instrument
for calculating the velocity of a cannon-ball in its flight,
and as the thundering discharge was heard, this
delicate apparatus proclaimed, simultaneously, that the
projectile had been sent on its way at a velocity of
nearly 1,500 feet a second, an impetus, it is said,
sufficient to make a hole through the Inflexible iron-
clad, with her twenty inches of armour and thick teak
backing. The Boulanger instrument is easily explained.
Placed in front of the gun, at an interval apart, are two

An impression has become general, through the statements of
our contemporaries, that the Sub-Wealden boring has been per-
manently stopped. This is not the case; for at the last meeting
of the committee it was determined to carry it on to a depth of
2,000 feet, and if funds continue to flow in with the success
which has previously characterised this movement, the boring,
it is hoped, will be carried to the greatest depth attainable.
The boring has now reached a depth of more than 1,900 feet,
and was to be recommenced this week; should, however, a
greater depth than 2,000 feet be determined on, it will be neces-
sary to enlarge and reline the hole, which will cost from 600/. to
700/. Arrangements are being made by which it is hoped that

a continuous core may be obtained from the present depth to
that of 2,000 feet. We believe the Government grant of a
pound a foot for each foot bored ceases at 2,000 feet, and, look-
ing to the important light the prosecution of this boring will
throw, not only on many theoretical questions of modern science,
but on so many doubtful points of practical interest to Eng-
land, it is sincerely to be hoped that the advisability of
continuing the grant will be seriously considered by her Majesty's
Ministers.
We have received from Messrs. Allsopp and from Dr. Ilassall
letters referring to the statement noticed in our review of the
work of the latter on Food (vol. xiii. p. 345), that the water used
by the former in the brewing of their ales contains 7'65 grains of
sulphate of zinc. Dr. Hassall expresses great annoyance that
through some inadvertence on his part this unfortunate error, as
it obviously is, should have been allowed to get into his book.
He points out, what no doubt would be evident to most readers,
that sulphate of zinc is a mistake for sulphate of potash. He
assures us that no trace of so deleterious a substance as sulphate
of zinc has been found in the water used by Messrs. Allsopp,
and that their celebrated bitter beer consists solely of the pro-
ducts of malt and hops, and the constituents of pure spring-
water. A further letter from Dr. Hassall, for which we have
not space, wdl be found in our advertisement columns.

Mr. Stanford has sent us specimens of some veiy fine maps

hitherto been peculiar to Germany. The maps are really admir-
able specimens of a very difficult kind of cartography, and we
have only one fault to find with them. \ Unfortunately, the

of the atomic weights of the constituent bodies. In fact the
order of the divergences would seem to render it probable that
the specific volumes of the several members of a family of ele-
ments increase with their atomic weights.
In a former communication to the Royal Society the author
has given the results of a series of observations on the specific
gravities, boiling points, and rate of expansion of certain liquid
chlorides of phosphorus. Since Roscoe has shown that vanadium
is a member of the phosphorus group of elements, it appeared
to him that a comparison of the specific volumes of the analo-
gously constituted phosphoryl and vanadyl trichlorides might
serve to throw additional light on this question of the relation of
the specific volumes of the members of a family of elements to
their atomic weights.
Three determinations of specific gravity of phosphoryl tri-
chloride made with different b< ttles gave a mean number of
1*71185 at o° compared with water at same temperature; com-
pared with water at 40 the specific gravity is 171163.
The rate of expansion of phosphoryl trichloride from 0° to its
boiling-point may be accurately represented by the expression—
V = I + 0001 064 309/ + 0000 001 12666/3

Its specific gravity at 107'23 is I '50987; hence its specific
volume = -53'308 = 101-58.

The results obtained with the dilatometer in the case of vanadyl

V = 1 + o-ooo 965 236/ + o-ooo 000 898 26/'
+ 0-000000003 '91 63 f3.
The mean of three experiments gives the specific gravity of
vanadyl trichloride at o°, compared with water at 40, as 1-86527.
The specific gravity of vanadyl trichlorideat 12 7"-19 is 1-63067;
hence its specific volume is ->-> = 106-54.

It is thus evident that the specific volumes of vanadyl and
phosphoryl trichlorides are not equal; the compound with the
higher molecular weight has the greater specific volume.
In the communication on the chlorides of phosphorus already
referred to, it is shown that if it be assumed, as appears in the
highest degree probable, that there is a relation between the
manner in which the oxygen atoms in a compound are heH in
union and their specific volume, it follows that the oxygen atom
in POCI3 possesses the smaller of the two values 122 and 7-8
assigned by Kopp to oxygen, and accordingly that this atom is
attached to the phosphorus by only one combining unit.

As the difference between the two values for the volume of

the specific volumes of VOCI3 and POCI3, viz., 106-54-101-58 =

the two liquids may be due to the different manner in which

It appeared to the author of interest to determine (i) if the
specific volumes of these liquids exhibit a relation similar to that
which is shown by their molecular weights ; and (2) if the relation
in their specific volumes is preserved in analogous combinations
of the two bodies. He has accordingly determined the specific
gravities, boiling-points, and rates of expansion of bromine and
iodine monochloride, and of the compounds which these sub-
stances form by their union with ethene, C,H4. The observa-
tions also serve to determine if bromine and iodine monochloride
preserve, when in combination, the volumes which they possess
in the free state.
It is evident from the observations that the specific volumes
of bromine and iodine chloride are not equal, neither are the
specific volumes of ethene bromide and ethene chloriodide; the
bodies with the greater molecular weights have the greater specific
volumes.

The number obtained for iodine monochloride differs consider-
ably from the volume calculated by means of Kopp's values
(CI = 228, I = 37'5), viz., 603. The specific volume of bromine
(Br2) is also less than Kopp's number, 55-6. The value assigned
to chlorine is unquestionably far more accurate than that given
to iodine, since the value of the latter element was calculated
from only two or three compounds, whereas the former number
was deduced from a comparatively large number of chlorinated
products. That the value for iodine needs revision seems to be
confirmed by Billet's observations of the specific gravities of
liquid iodine at various temperatures. If his results be plotted
down and the curve prolonged to the boiling-point of iodine, we
find that the specific gravity of iodine at this point is 3-780;
hence the specific volume of iodine (I.)—
= 1J*g = 335.
3780
If now this value be added to that of chlorine as given by
Kopp, we get a result identical. with the observed volume, of
iodine monochloride—
33-5 + 22-8 = 56-3.
If we subtract the specific volumes of C2 H4, as calculated by
the aid of Kopp's values (C = 11, H = 5-5, Ca H4 - 44), from
the specific volumes of ethene bromide and ethene chloriodide,
we obtain numbers which are nearly equal to the specific volumes
of bromine and iodine chloride respectively—

This correspondence between the two sets of values seems to
warrant the conclusion that bromine and iodine chloride possess
the same volume in a compound which they have when in the
free state.
It is not unreasonable to suppose that the same may be true of
ethene itself, viz., that at its boiling-point it would possess the
same volume which it has in the bromide and chloriodide at
their respective boiling-points. On this assumption the specific
gravity of liquid ethene would be—

Physical and Natural History Society, Jan. 20.—Dr.
Prevost, Head Physician to the Geneva Cantonal Hospital, pre-
sented a photograph of the brain of a person who had been
affected with aphasia. The lesion, which consists in a slightly
yellowish softening somewhat like cicatrisation, occupies a space
of about two centimetres on the posterior part of the third left
frontal convolution. The meninges are adherent en a level with
the diseased point. The "island " of Reil is healthy except at
a point which touches the affected convolution. The interval
separating two convolutions of the "island " presents a yellowish
coloration, and contains granulous bodies. The convolutions
themselves of the "island" are, on the other hand, sound.
This brain belonged to a woman aged seventy-five years, affected
for about a month with right hemiplegia without contractions
and without loss of sensibility, and who presented an almost
complete aphasia. Incapable of speaking, she pronounced only
isolated syllables without any meaning, as Eh, eh : Ah, oi; - - -
eh, tafia - ah! ha, ba, za-za-ya. One day she said maman; this
was the only comprehensible word she uttered. She succumbed

Broca regards as constant in cases of aphasia. It is known that
M. Meynert and others, on the contrary, localise the faculty
of speech in the lobule of the insula, which in the above case
was scarcely touched. Dr. Prevost observed at the Cantonal Hos-
pital another case of aphasia, in which the lobule of the insula
was the seat of the lesion, while the third left frontal convolu-
tion was intact, and thinks we cannot localise exactly the faculty
of^language exclusively in either of the seats in question.

ALTHOUGH the term Aquitaine employed in the title
of this work is used in its widest sense as embracing
the whole country between the Loire and the Cdvcnnes,
the prehistoric researches recorded in the seventeen
quarto numbers of it, which have appeared periodically,
commencing in December 1863, are confined to the
Province of Perigord, and chiefly to the valley of the
Vezere, a tributary of the Dordogne.
Here the river, which has cut its way deeply into the
cretaceous rocks of the district, has formed a narrow
tortuous valley, bounded on either side at intervals by
cliffs rising to a'height of 300 feet in some places. Above

this the surrounding country forms an extensive plateau,
varying in altitude, but rarely rising to any great height
above the summit of the valley.
Owing to the different degrees of hardness of the cal-
careous rocks which form the precipitous sides of the
valley, the weathering of the face of the cliff has been
very unequal, the softer portions yielding to the action of
the atmosphere have formed deep grooves, and in places,
caves as much as 30 feet in depth have been formed,
extending some of them, for a hundred yards or more
along the sides of the cliff. As these caves afford con-
venient places of shelter, they have been occupied as
residences by the inhabitants of the valley at many different
periods, but more particularly by a race of prehistoric
Troglodytes, who form the subject of the present work.
The presence of these people is indicated by successive
layers of dSris beneath the present floors of the caves
denoting successive periods of occupation, and separated
from each other in some places by a coating of stalagmite
of considerable thickness. The small distance of some
of the caves above the river proves that the latter can
have deepened its course but little, if at all, since the
caves were occupied by prehistoric men; the cave of La
Madelaine, in which numerous works of art of the Trog-
lodytes have been found, is but little above the level of

extraordinary floods of the river at the present time, whilst
those of Le Moustier and Les Eyzies are 90 and 100 feet
respectively above the river. The position of the caves,
consequently, affords little or no evidence as to the age of
their contents, which has to be determined in two ways,
firstly, by the associated animal remain?; and secondly,
by the nature of the relics of human workmanship. From
both of these sources we derive proof of the greater anti-
quity of the Le Moustier cave than those of La Madelaine,
Les Eyzies, and Laugerie Basse, in the same valley.

the explorers to attribute the find to the earliest cave
period. The position of the human remains, however,
aboTe the relic beds would, as Mr. Boyd Dawkins has
shown in his work on "Cave- Hunting," be sufficient to
throw doubt on their contemporaneity with the other
relics of the cave were it not that skeletons have been
since found in other caverns in the valley, and more par-
ticularly in that of Laugerie Basse, in positions which
make it certain that they are of the age of the works of art
found with the m, and these skeletons correspond in their
osteological peculiarities with those of Cro-Magnon. In
both places the skulls are dolichocephalic, and both afford
instances of men of large stature having platycnemic
tibias, one of those from Cro-Magnon being, according
to Boyd Dawkins, the extremest case of platycnemism on
record. We have therefore good grounds for believing
that markedly different types of mankind existed in the
south of Europe during the reindeer period. This result
bas been held by polygenists to afford satisfactory con-
firmation of their views, but we may be permitted to
doubt the validity of such conclusions. If, as has been

suggested by Prof. Huxley, this part of Europe was occu-
pied in the earliest times by a race of Melanochroi, con-
sisting of a mixture of the dark long-headed race of the
south with the fair and presumably short-headed race of the
north, it is evident that types as divergent as any that are
to be found at the present time must have existed amongst
the earliest known inhabitants of this region. A long
previous period of geographical separation under different
climatic conditions would be sufficient to give permanence
to varieties as distinct as any that have been brought to
light by the researches of Anthropologists. We are far
from believing that the reindeer period has carried us
more than a short way towards the origin of the human
race. ¦
Since the explorations of Messrs. Lartet and Christy
were brought to a close, another chapter has been added
to the history of the reindeer period by the discovery of
Mr. Conrad Merk in the cave of Kesslerloch, near Thayn-
gen, in Switzerland; the value of this discovery is greatly
enhanced by its vicinity to the relics of the later inha-
bitants of the lakes. Had the lake habitations been
occupied at the same time as the cave, evidence of
connection must undoubtedly have been found, but the
contents of the cave point undeniably to a period contem-
poraneous with the remoter Troglodytes of the Dordogne.

Amongst the fauna the presence of the mammoth, rhino-
ceros, cave-bear, lion, and reindeer are alone sufficient to
warrant this conclusion, whilst at the same time the
works of art show a most remarkable resemblance to
those of the French caves, and an equally marked con-
trast to those of the oldest of the Swiss lake villages.
The carved harpoon heads of bone, the absence of
pottery, the presence of deer-horns perforated with large
holes bored from both sides, the use of which is unknown,
and above all the engravings of animals, especially the
reindeer, upon the horns of those animals, show that
a condition of culture corresponding to that of the Dor-
dogne people must have existed here.
Opinions differ as to which of the two localities have
produced the highest types of art; the difference of style
observable in the engravings is such as might be expected
to exist amongst remote tribes, but the resemblance, when
compared with the productions of other races of savages
is no less remarkable.

bis observations. The list of sun-spots at the end of the
publication and the various extracts from the note-book
will prove very useful to those who are engaged in
researches of a similar kind. The observations seem to
have been conducted with great care, and Dr. Lohse gives
us in every case the exact method by which the measure.
ments have been made.
If we endeavour to [review a work which is not being
continued, at least for the present, we rather turn to the
actual results of the observations than to a mere list of
accumulated facts. This list, no doubt, may prove here-
after to be the most important part of the work, yet it is
only made important by those who discuss the observa-
tions. The more doubtful and hypothetical part, con-
taining the conclusions, is therefore the better test for the
moment, for we must not forget that without a guiding
idea a mere tabular arrangement of facts is useless.
One of the most curious results of Dr. Lohse seems
to be the discovery of a period of fifty days in the eruptive
activity of the sun. Dr. Lohse took from the drawings
of protuberances published by the Spectroscopic Society
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of Italy, the area of the protuberances as shown in the
drawings for each day, and made a curve in which the
times of observation formed the abscissae and the area
of the protuberances the ordinates. This curve first
shows maxima and minima corresponding to maxima and
minima of sun-spots. It next shows a short period of
fifty days. During the years 1871, 1872, and the be-
ginning of 1873, this period was well marked. From the
middle of 1873, however, the whole solar activity became
so small, owing to its chief periodicity of eleven years,
that these secondary maxima cannot any more be distin-
guished.
We turn now 'to the spectroscopic observations, in
which Dr. Lohse was led to somewhat similar conclusions
as Mr. Lockyer. It is a well-known fact, that while
nearly all the elements standing at the positive end of the
electro-static series are found in the sun, we have as yet
obtained no decided evidence of the more electro-negative
elements. On the other hand, it is not probable that the
sun should not contain so many bodies which play an
important part in our world. Both Mr. Lockyer and Dr.
Lohse came to the conclus ion that we must look in the
outer and cooler layers of the sun's atmosphere for evi-
dence of the metalloids, but while Mr. Lockyer assumes
that they exist as well in the hotter parts of the solar
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
envelope, but under such conditions that we cannot
identify their spectra, Dr. Lohse assumes that they do not
exist except in the outer layers of the corona. Dr. Lohse
is thus forced to assume a force in the sun which drives
all the more electro-negative elements away from its
centre. This is an hypothesis which we cannot accept,
unless we have independent evidence in its favour, or
unless it is the only one which will account for the facts;
just as we could not accept Mr. Lockyer's hypothesis, if
we had no evidence of changes in spectra produced by
variations of temperature and pressure. Mr. Lockyer's
hypothesis has a decided advantage over that of Dr.
Lohse, for we have recently obtained such strong proofs
of the changes of spectra produced by a variation of tem-
perature and pressure, that we cannot help thinking that
had Dr. Lohse been acquainted with all these recent
experiments, he would have come to the same conclusion
as Mr. Lockyer. This conclusion, indeed, seems inevitable,
if it is once assumed that the metalloids really exist in the
sun. It is important to mention that this presence of
metalloids in the sun is rendered still more probable by

the broad statements arc apt to mislead. It is all very
well to say, as does Dr. Letourneau, that the heart is

considering the nature of that organ in the crocodiles, we
think its nature in them ought to be mentioned. The
title of the work is so all-embracing that we think it can
hardly be justified by its contents. Morphology as well
as physiology, together with the principles of evolution
and classification, are all parts of "biology," nevertheless
in the work before us morphology, and the immediate
dependents of that science, are not touched upon. A
more fitting title would have been " Comparative Physi-

from other works. The descriptions are clear and con-

intricate questions of priority, such as those in which the
nomenclature of many of the recent American paljeontological
discoveries is unfortunately involved, cannot be discussed and
settled in brief abstracts; but I see that the above statement

Bones of some of these animals were discovered by Prof. Marsh

scribed by the former in the following year (American Journal

to be no doubt that Leidy's name, Uintatherium (Proceedings of
Ike Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, 1872, p. 169;
read July 30, published August 1), was the earliest of the new
generic designations applied to any of the group, and therefore
ought to be adopted for the whole, until it is clearly shown that
any sufficiently important distinctions exist between them to
warrant their separation into different genera.

Morell's "Euclid Simplified"
It is only quite recently that my attention has been directed
to the review of "Euclid Simplified" in Nature, vol. xiii. pp.
201-204. I shall endeavour to condense my reply to the criticisms
contained in that review as much as possible, taking them in the
order in which they occur, which will simplify the controversy.
And firstly, it is objected that "the title ' Euclid Simplified'
is a misnomer, for the method of Euclid (the geometer) is de-
parted from altogether." I reply by explaining that by far the
greater part of the theorems and problems, and also the method
followed throughout in " Euclid Simplified" are taken directly
from Amiot's "Elements de Geometric " (15th edition, 1873)-
In his preface to another work, "Lecons Nouvelles de Geo-
metrie Elementaire" (1865), Amiot says: "Les elements de
geometrie que nous venons de rcimprimer et cette seconde edi-
tion des Lecons nouvelles de geometrie, sont deux ouvrages dif-
ferents. Le premier n'est que l'expose de la geometrie des
anciens ; le second est un essaide geometrie generate, e'est-a-dire
qu'il comprend non settlement les Elements d'Euclide, mais encore
les principes de la geometrie moderne, qui est resumee et, pour
ainsi dire, personnifie dans les travaux de M. Chasles, notre
geometre par excellence." I infer that in adopting and follow-
ing Amiot's "Elements," I have followed the ancients and
Euclid, though shortened and simplified.
At a subsequent part of the review the writer is exposed to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
severe animadversions for his intention to produce what is repre-
sented to be an epitome of the brilliant discoveries of M. Chasles.
This matter can also be set at rest by referring to the extract
from the preface of M. Amiot, previously given. Mr. Morell
has only projected a compilation and translation from Amiot's
"Lecons Nouvelles," and from Rouche and De Comberousse
(lm Partie. Geometrie Plane. Appendice), also treating of
modern geometry.
Passing from the title to the contents, I admit that the typo-
graphical errors are unfortunately numerous, nor is it possible to
avoid this except by employing the best and most expensive prin-
ters. The misprints matter and cord, the omission of the word
"side" before "of the equilateral triangle," and the passage re-
lating to the quadrilateral A B C D must be referred to this
category. The latter passage is translated from Legendre (edition
1868 [not 1872], p. 78), and requires the fourth side A D to be
added, which has been omitted by the printer. For "without
changing" read also "thereby changing "—in this case I confess
an oversight of the writer.
I proceed next to meet the strictures of the reviewer relating to
Gallicisms and the use of terms new to boys. In defence I might

The Ocelli in Insects
At vol. xiii. p. 168, H. M tiller calls the attention of entomolo-
gists to a subject which has interested other entomologists be-
fore—the function of the ocelli in insects. With due deference to
a suggestion made by such an authority, it seems to me that the
size of the ocelli in hymenopterous insects is not dependent on
their nocturnal habits. Why in hymenoptcra more than in other
orders? Indeed, it may be doubted whether in some insects
the ocelli are organs of vision at all, or at least whether they are
of any practical use as such in the imago. Their number, as
well as size, differs in different species of the same order, seem-
ingly without regard to their habits, whether diurnal or nocturnal,
and in many moths they are so completely concealed by the
scales that it is necessary to divi.ie the head to ascertain whether
they are present or absent, so that it is difficult to understand
how they can be of any service as organs of vision. May they

ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT ON SELENIUM
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ON the 18th of last month Dr. C. William Siemens
gave a lecture to the members of the Royal Insti-
tution on the above subject.
Commencing with a general reference to light as a
natural force, he showed how little the potential action of
light made itself evident to our senses, as with the dis-
appearance of the light its effects seemed entirely to
vanish ; he then showed a temporary effect of light by
its action on phosphorescent salts, which continue to
g'o* for a long time after the source of light is removed,
and drew attention to the permanent effect produced by
the decomposition of the salts of silver in photography,
lie next referred to the radiometer, Mr. Crookes' little
machine for illustratinc light effects, which he brought
forward for the purpose of showing the motive power of
light, and closed his introduction by a reference to some
experiments which he had made on a fungus that
lives in the dark, and which, on analysis, gave no evi-
dence of containing carbon, thus helping to favour the
hypothesis that it is not hea'., but the ray of light which

Dr. Werner Siemens has constructed a selenium pho-
tometer, in which the selenium is prepared so as not to be
affected by the changes to which that substance is liable,
and which consists of a single sensitive plate mounted
upon a vertical axis, upon which it can be turned through
a certain angular distance limited by stops. When touch-
ing the one stop the selenium stands opposite the normal
candle, and when touching the other opposite the light to
be measured, the distance upon the former being changed
upon a scale until no effect upon the needle of a galvano-
meter is produced in turning the sensitive plate in rapid
succession from the one stop to the other.
The lecture was concluded by the exhibition of a sele-
nium eye, which Mr. Siemens had prepared to illustrate
the extraordinary sensitiveness of the selenium prepara-
tions. It consists of a hollow ball with two circular
openings opposite each other, the one being furnished
with a lens iJt inches in diameter, and the other with an
adjustable stopper carrying a sensitive plate, which is
connected by wires to a galvanometer and one DanielPs
cell. The lens is covered by two slides representing eye-

lids, the ball itself being the body of the eye, and the
sensitive plate occupying the place of the retina. Having
placed a white illuminated screen in front of the artificial
eye, on opening the eyelids a strong deflection of the
galvanometer was observed, a black screen giving hardly
any deflection, a blue one a greater, a red a much greater,
but still short of that produced by the reflected white
light. The eye was thus sensitive to light and colour, and
as stated, it would not be difficult to arrange a contact
and electro-magnet in connection with the galvanometer,
so that intense light would cause the automatic closing
of the eyelids. The artificial eye is subject to fatigue,
and the lecturer considered that this experiment might
be suggestive to physiologists as regards the natural con-
joint action of the retina and the brain.
THE LATE COLONEL STRANGE, F.R.S.
T IEUT.-COL. ALEXANDER STRANGE, F.R.S,
*—' whose death we last week announced, was the fourth
son of the late Sir Thomas Strange, and was born at
Westminster on the 27th of April, 1818, and was educated
at Harrow. On leaving school in 1834, at the early age
of sixteen, he proceeded to India, and joined the 7th
Regiment of Madras Light Cavalry, where his natural
talents began to develop themselves. He shortly after-
wards made the friendship of General Worster, who soon
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
discovered that he had mechanical abilities of the highest
order, and who subsequently instructed him in the use
of astronomical and surveying instruments, and pointed
out to him that nature had intended him for a scientific
career. During the next few years he became a devoted
student at the Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory
at Simla, then under the direction of Major-General
Boileau, R.E., at whose recommendation he was nomi-
nated, in 1847, by Col. (now Sir Andrew) Waugh, R.E.,
Surveyor-General of India, to the office of Second Assist-
ant in the Great Trigonometrical Survey, where he found
work suited to his talents. He was originally selected on
account of his ability as an observer, and for his extra-
ordinary mechanical skill, which in this department was
of special value, and was displayed in such a remarkable
degree as to call forth me highest commendation from
Col. Waugh. In the season 1848-49 he was attached to
the party under Capt. (now Col.) Renny Tailyour, R.E.,
in order that he might acquire a practical knowledge of
geodetical operations. Such was the rapidity with which
he made himself master of this difficult subject, that in

thermometers, drawing, and mathematical instruments of
all kinds were rigorously inspected, compared, and verified
under Col. Strange's personal superintendence, and the
improved forms of instruments now supplied to the ser-
vices in India, are in a very large measure due to his
efforts, and it must have been a source of gratification to
him to find that they were received with almost universal
approbation. He devoted much anxious time and thought
to the laborious task of testing the magnificent series of
instruments above alluded to.
The telescope has an aperture of 3J inches, with a
focal length of 36 inches. The instrument is constructed
upon what is known as "the flying micrometer plan,"
and possesses a great number of peculiarities which
are quite unique. It will be found fully described in a
paper read by him before the Royal Society in 1872.
This is undoubtedly the finest instrument of its kind ever
constructed, and will be an enduring monument to his
unremitting energy and constructive genius. The zenith
sectors were designed for the accurate determination of
latitude, and in design are unlike any of their prede-

cessors; being intended for portable instruments the
problem was to get the maximum of power out of the
minimum of weight, and in this he was eminently suc-
cessful, for on comparing one of these with the weight of
the zenith sector designed by the present Astronomer
Royal for the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain it was found
to be only about one-half. With regard to the perform-
ance of these instruments, Capt. J. Herschel, R.E., F.RS.,
who has been employed in determining latitudes in
Southern India, in comparing the facility of working the
zenith sector and the former astronomical circles of the
Great Trigonometrical Survey, states that " the sectors are
competent to turn out at least double the amount of work
of the same order," adding, " at this rate two or three
years' work, would equal in amount the whole results up
to the date of the arrival of the sectors, and ten years (a
comparatively short period for which to arrange a system
of observation on a matter of this magnitude) will see us
in a position to look back on the arrival of the sectors as
on the commencement of a new era." All the other in-
struments present evidences of Col. Strange's construc-
tive genius.
Such is the amount of skill and forethought brought to
bear upon the design of these exquisite instruments that
an observer may select a series of stars differing only five

minutes of time in Right Ascension. Each star is observed
twice in reversed positions of the telescope at the same
culmination, and each of the two reversed observations
involves two settings of the telescope in altitude, four
microscope, two level and one micrometer reading. To
admit of all these operations being performed within five
minutes of time, with the deliberation requisite for obser-
vations aiming at fractions of a second, demands the
highest conveniences of instrumental construction.
After their completion and final testing, they were seve-
rally despatched to India, where they have for some years
been employed in the Survey Department, unapproachable
for manipulative facilities and giving results unsurpassed
in accuracy. Indeed, it is not too much to say that these
instruments, in the construction of which Col. Strange had
the advantage of being so ably seconded by the late Mr.
Cooke, of York, and the well-known firm of Troughton
and Simms, are the most perfect and powerful geodetical
instruments which have ever been constructed or are likely
to be constructed for some years to come.

by the tide or waves, there is no evidence of their volun-
tarily leaving the water to bask or feed on the shore.
The species now existing are very few, and there is
reason to believe that the time is not far distant when
they will all become extinct. One species, the Rytina
stelleri, or Northern Sea-cow, an animal attaining nearly
the length of thirty feet, by far the largest known member
of the order, from the North Pacific, was totally exter-
minated by the agency of man during the last century,
and the surviving species, the Manatis and Dugongs,
being valuable for their flesh as food, their hides, and
especially for the oil obtained from the thick layer of fat
which lies immediately beneath their skin, rapidly
diminish in numbers as civilised populations occupy the
regions which form their natural habitat.
The Manatis (genus Manatus), found on the Atlantic
coasts of America and Africa, are rather fluviatile than
marine in their habitat, ascending large rivers almost to
their sources, and feeding chiefly on aquatic grasses. The
Dugongs (genus Halicore) are more distinctly marine,
feeding chiefly on algae. They inhabit the shallow waters,

bays and creeks of various coasts of the Indian Ocean,
the Red Sea, East Coast of Africa, the Indo-Malayan
Archipelago, and north coast of Australia. There is
probably not more than one species, but they have been
divided into three according to the locality which they
inhabit. H. tabemaculi from the Red Sea, H. dugong
from the Indian Seas, and H. australis from Australia.
These two existing genera present such well-marked dis-
tinguishing characters that if they alone were known they
might be placed in separate families, but as in so many
similar cases our knowledge of the extinct forms, imper-
fect as it is, goes far to bridge over the distinction between
them. It is true that Brandt, a great authority on this
group, divides the order into two primary sections—Mana-
tidct, consisting of Manatus alone, and Halicorida, con-
taining all the other genera; but it scarcely seems that
these can be considered in any sense as equivalent, espe-
cially as one of the distinguishing chracters, the external
form of the tail is unknown in the extinct genera.
The Miocene and eaily Pliocene seas of Europe
abounded in Sirenians, to which the generic name Hali-
therium, Kaup, has been given. They had large tusk-like
incisors in the upper jaw, as in the existing Halicore, though
not so greatly developed. Their molar teeth are — or —,

anteriorly simple and single-rooted, posteriorly with three
roots in the upper jaw, and two below, and with enamelled,
tuberculated, or ridged crowns, in which respect they ap-
proach nearer to Manatus, the molar teeth of the Dugongs
being without enamel and single-rooted. The anterior
molars were deciduous. Some species, at least had nasal
bones, short, broad, but normal in position, whereas in all
the existing genera these bones are quite rudimentary.
Another and still more important evidence of conformity
to the general mammalian type is the better development of
the pelvic bone, and the presence of a small styliform
femur articulated to the acetabulum, although no traces of
any other part of the limb have been discovered. These
ancient Sirenians were thus, in dental, cranial, and other
osteological characters, less specialised than are either of
the existing species, and if the intermediate links could be
discovered, might well be looked upon as ancestral forms
from which the latter have been derived, but at present
the transitional conditions have not been detected. As

to the origin of the Anglo-Saxons by showing that they
came from Friesland in the sixth or seventh century.
The same remark applies to the origin of nearly all fishes,
in fact, only one clear case of progressive modifi-
cation is known in the whole class ; this is afforded by
the group of the Pycnodonta.
These are fish not unlike our John Dory in shape,
which appear for the first time in the carboniferous
rocks, and become extinct in the older tertiaries ; they
are distinguished by the possession of rows of large
crushing teeth, and in place of a vertebral column had a
gelatinous chorda dorsalis or notochord. The spinal cord
above this was embraced by arches of bone, placed at
regular intervals along the chorda; and, immediately
below these neural arches, were attached the ribs, also
bony. In the Carboniferous forms, both arches and ribs
are quite distinct from one another, and are simply united
by ligamentous fibres to the notochord; but, in the older
Secondary species, they become expanded at their ends,
and thus tend to embrace the notochord ; and, lastly, in
the Tertiary pyenodonts this process is carried to such an

extent as almost to produce a ring of bone, like the body
of a rudimentary vertebra.
Now let us turn to the next group of Vertebrate animals,
that of Amphibia (frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders),
which are distinguished from fishes by certain very
striking peculiarities. Fishes are all capable of breathing
the air dissolved in water by means of gills, and—a far
more important distinctive character—their limbs always
have the character of fins, which organs are seen in their
simplest form in Ceratodus. In this fish, there is a long
jointed cartilaginous axis, running down the middle of the
fin, with rows of rays of the same substance on each side
of it; the whole is invested by a fold of the integument,
the margins of which are beset with horny filaments called
fin-rays. In all fishes these elements are to be found,
generally in a curiously modified condition; in the bony
fishes, for instance, the central axis with its side appen-
dages are broadened out and shortened, the fin-rays
becoming at the same time so much larger as to form the
main part of the fin.
Some modification of this type of limb is possessed by
all fishes which have limbs at all; but the first character,
that afforded by the respiratory organs, is not absolute,
for there are some fishes which, besides gills, possess an
apparatus for breathing air directly. This apparatus,

represented by the air-bladder of ordinary fishes, first
takes on its new character and becomes a lung in that
remarkable genus, Ceratodus, in which it exists as a
large cellular structure situated in the upper part of the
abdominal cavity, just under the vertebral column, and
connected with the gullet by a slit—the glottis—by means
of which the fish can pass air from the mouth into the
lung. It is not, however, this peculiarity of opening into
the cesophagus which constitutes a lung, for the air-
bladder of many fishes possesses an open duct of a simi-
lar nature; the great distinguishing feature is, that the
blood taken to this bladder docs not pass into the ordi-
nary venous channels, but is returned immediately to the
heart, in a purified condition, by a special vein. In Cera-
todus there is no special vessel to carry blood to the lung,
in other words, although there is a pulmonary vein, the
pulmonary artery has not appeared; but in the Mudfish
(Lepidosiren) of Africa and eastern South America, the
development of the lung goes a step further, a special
pulmonary artery being present, as in all the higher
animals. Thus Ceratodus and Lepidosiren are truly

series of changes, in which the fish, Lepidosiren, perenni-
branchiate, and triton, are all represented.
One would be inclined to infer from these metamor-
phoses, that, on tracing the Amphibia back in time, the
story of their origin should be told, but, as a matter of
fact, palasontological history tells a different story alto-
gether. Abundant remains of frogs and toads are found
in the Miocene deposits, some of which are of so fine a
character that even the tadpoles are preserved ; but these
tertiary frogs and toads do not differ, in any important par-
ticulars, from those of the present day, and the same is
true of the tritons and salamanders. Some of the latter
attained a very great size, and one of them—a near ally of
the great Japanese salamander of the present day—has
had a very singular fate, having been described, about the
middle of the last century, as a fossil man, by the German
naturalist Scheuchzer, who named it "Homo diluvii
testis," the man who saw the flood!
In the Wealden and Purbeck formations no Amphibia
have as yet been discovered, but, from the Lower Lias to
the Carboniferous they turn up again in remarkable num-

bers, and of great size, but differing f om existing forms
in some important peculiarities, and affording no help
whatever to our inquiries as to the origin of the existing
or of the tertiary frogs, toads, and salamanders. Under
the throat, these gigantic Amphibia had a remarkable
shield of three bony plates, as well as a series of plates
along the belly. Their teeth were large and powerful,
and presented an extremely complicated structure, vhence
the group has received its name of Labynnthodonta.
Thus, in tracing back the existing Amphibia, we find a
great break in the secondary period, and then come upon
a distinct group, the Labyrinthodonta, from which the
existing forms cannot possibly be deduced. These, again,
have been traced no farther back than the carboniferous
epoch.

PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS

as the correspondence proceeds will confer on education

The moment is a critical one for scientific teaching.
Lord Salisbury's Bill will come to mean a revolution in
the educational structure of the Universities ; the Report

other points, is distinct in wishing to see Science heartily
recognised and systematically taught. If Science Teach-

rously, the game is in their hands.

certain propositions on this subject in the hope that they,
or such others as may be preferred to them, may become
the basis of the agreement we all desiderate :—
1. The business of a school is general education; the
business of a University is special education.
2. The principal subjects taught at a school should be
Literature, Mathematics, Science.
3. Each of these subjects should be studied in fixed
relative proportions of time, from the very beginning of a
school course until its close.

ments therein stated, as applying to the extension of my
especial subject—Biology—may be found to suit the case
and claims of science teaching at large. And it may not
be inappropriate to conclude by re-echoing the remark
with which I started, namely, that if we can succeed in
creating a demand for science teaching, by showing the
honest claims and true value of scientific instruction in
an ordinary educational curriculum, we shall have paved
the way for a harmonious and natural after-adjustment of
fiuch questions as have very ably been ventilated in

I have read with considerable interest what may be
styled the evidence of your correspondents as to the state
of scientific instruction in schools, and I think possibly if
your space will permit me, that I shall be able to confirm
some of the statements of previous writers. I have reason
to believe that in some large schools where science is
demanded as a branch of education it is practically sup-
pressed, some of the clever lads are removed from the
science classes in order to be "crammed" in classics,

sometimes against their own desires, for the purpose, if
possible, of making a show in school-lists as having
obtained scholarships at Oxford. 1 am acquainted with
facts which cannot be otherwise explained. Sometimes I
have learned these from the boys themselves, sometimes
from science-masters in different establishments. At one
large school in connection with a College there are about
600 boys ; formerly very nearly 100 attended chemistry lec-
tures once a week, and about 25 attended the chemical
laboratory of the College for i| hour. The subject was
a voluntary one, and the undoubted interest shown by the
scholars was very striking; one could see that they were
being taught to think, it was something so entirely dif-
ferent from their ordinary school work. For the last year
or two the number of boys attending these science classes
has been limited almost entirely to those who intend ma-
triculating at the London University, those whose parents
expressly wish their sons to receive such education, or
others "the most stupid and ignorant," who are so un-
likely to hold their own in any other competition that it is
considered they may be better fit for distinction in science.
I need hardly say that one fails to make anything of the
latter class, although, on the other hand, I have seen such

eight, and those who hear lectures about thirty-six. In a
school with unusual facilities for scientific instruction at a
small cost, since the teachers, the laboratories, the lecture-
rooms, and the very costly scientific apparatus, all belong
to the College, there is this small result simply because the
pupils are prohibited attending the lectures on science lest,
as it is said, " they should shirk their other work." This is
certainly riot equalising the various branches of human
knowledge. In some schools the science masters are ap-
pointed not from among those who have made the teaching
of science a study, but from that peculiar body who are
willing to combine instruction in science (which includes,
of course, Physics, Chemistry, Natural History, and
Botany), with Mathematics, Classics, and Foreign Lan-
guages, and whose views as to the suitable remuneration
for their services suggests a limited expenditure of
thought, time, and money, on their own acquirements.
From the present low estimation in which scientific know-
ledge is held, I should be exceedingly sorry to see the
number of efficient science teachers increased. The
capital expended on a classical education gives a far

The Athcnaum of Saturday last has a well-timed and justly
severe note in connection with the filling up of two vacancies
among the trustees of the British Museum. A writer in the
Times has mentioned the names of Sir Henry Rawlinson and
Mr. Layard as having claims for the vacant posts, and the
At/ioumm shows that only one trustee is appointed by the
Crown, and that the two vacancies will be filled up by the
Trustees themselves. "Let us hope," the Athcnaum says,

or at least one of them. But if they are elected, they will succeed
to a perfectly barren honour, unless they are subsequently placed
on the Working Committees. It is notorious, that Dr. Hooker,
who is a trustee, by virtue of his office as President of the Royal
Society, has absolutely no voice in the disposal of the vast col-
lections of natural history contained in the Museum; and that
although there is no naturalist among the trustees with the
exception of Sir Philip Egerton. And it is doubtful whether
such men as Mr. Layard and Sir Henry Rawlinson, whose
sympathies are likely to be with progress and reform, with
scholarship and education, will be quite in harmony with that
system which has made the British Museum what it now is.
They might not feel anxious to strengthen the hands of those
officials who are said to have recently endeared themselves to
the gentlemen and scholars beneath them by the issue of a
slave circular (to use the name by which it is popularly known in
the Reading-room), of which it is asserted that some member of
the legislature will before long demand the publication."
We are grateful to the Daily News for the advanced and
decided views it always takes in matters affecting the interests of
science; indeed its advocacy of the claims of science in the
country is a distinctive feature of the paper. In an able article
in Friday's issue the unsatisfactory condition of the British Museum
;s pointed out, and it is shown that until an entirely new system
of management is instituted, no reform can be expected. "It

would seem, indeed, as if the framer of the constitution of the
British Museum had, with fiendish malignity, selected precisely
those persons as trustees who could by no possibility find time
to attend to their duties." It is shown that the recommendations
of successive Royal Commissions have been ignored, and that
no means have yet been taken to carry out improvements which
would greatly increase the usefulness of the Museum. We hope
that this article, in conjunction with the note in the Atheiiicum
to which we have referred, will have some effect in stimulatisig
the Government to carry out the recommendations of the Duke
of Devonshire's Commission and take steps to render the Museum
of greater service than it is to science and the country; and that
even with its present drawbacks it does render great services
must be admitted.

fiendship between the natives and ourselves, exchanging pre-
sents. We have learnt something of the character of the in-

looking, energetic people. We obtained a considerable number
of specimens of natural history. We were disappointed at not

Each of the courses on the subjects numbered 5 to 11 would
probably require two terms, except those marked *, each of

With respect to the distribution of these courses among diffe-
rent teachers : —

with the delivery of one course of lectures, usually those on
general chemistry, would sufficiently occupy the time of the
professor. Organic chemistry, including the superintendence of
the practical work in this subject, would occupy the greater part
of the time of a second professor. He might, however, in some
cases also deliver one of the special courses. Some of the
special departments of chemistry might perhaps be undertaken
by demonstrators, but for the remainder, and tor catechetical in-
struction with a proper division of classes, two additional teachers
are at present needed who may very well be inter-collegiate
lecturers.
2. The superintendence of the physical laboratory, with the
teaching of such branches of mathematical physics as are not
provided for by other professors under the jurisdiction of the
Mathematical Hoard, would probably occupy all the time of the
Professor of Experimental Physics. The special experimental
courses might, if necessary, be given by demonstrators, but at
least one regular teacher of experimental physics in addition to
the professor would be desirable.
3. The mineralogical teaching at present required in the Uni-
versity might be given by the professor, the students being re-
ferred for the chemical part of the subject to one of the teachers
of Chemistry.
4. Stratigraphical geology, petrology, and Paleontology would
each require a separate teacher. Lectmes on different portions

of stratigraphical geology might b; delivered in different years.
Parts of the course on general geology {e.g. that on glacial phe-

on stratigraphical geology. Some parts (e.f. that on volcanic
phenomena; being undertaken by the penologist. Special de-
monstrations on Paleontology in connection with the course on
stratigraphical geology might be given by curators or demon-

might be given by one teacher.

teaching which is at present required in the special departments
of zoology might be given by Curators of the Museum, who
should also act as demonstrators; but special teachers of each

curators in zoology (molluscs and insects), to act also as demon-
strators; (4) two Demonstrators of Physiology; (5) an addi-
tional Demonstrator of Comparative Anatomy ; (6) an Assistant-
Curator of the Herbarium, to act also as Demonstrator of Syste-
matic Botany ; the Professor of Botany being ex officio Curator
of the Herbarium. The appliances most urgently needed are
laboratories for chemistry, comparative anatomy, physiology,
and vegetable morphology, and workrooms for the zoological
museums.
II. (a) It is desirable that all the teachers in each of the
several departments should be grouped in one organisation.
{A) The Board considers that while there is room in the Uni-
versity both for professors and lecturers, appointed directly by
the University, and for inter-collegiate lecturers, it is undesirable
to have lecturers in natural sciences teaching members of their
own colleges exclusively.
(c) It appears that physiology, comparative anatomy (as dis-
tinguished from zoology), and vegetable morphology and physio-
logy (as distinguished from systematic botany), are so important
and so distinct that they should be entrusted to independent
professors, but till this can be done the subjects may be under-

taken by other lecturers.
(d) It seems desirable that the selection of University pro-
fessors should be entrusted to a body of about seven electors, of
whom a majority should be residents in the University ; that
such electors should be appointed either for life, for a term of
years, or by virtue of holding some official post, and that those
who are not tx-officio electors should be nominated by the Board
of Studies with which the professorship is connected, and be
elected by the Senate. Further, that the selection of other
teachers appointed by the University, but not directly subordi-
nate to the professors, should be made by similar liodies of
electors resident in the University, or by the several Boards of
Studies, and that demonstrators should be appointed as at
present.
(e) It seems desirable that in the case of the recognition of
individual inlcr-collegiate lecturers by the University, the appoint-
ment of such lecturer should receive the confirmation of the
several Boards of Studies.
III. (a) It seems highly desirable that the professorial and
inter-collegiate lectures should be brought into closer relations
with each other ; and it seems probable that this may be effected,
in part at least, by organising meetings of the professors and
other teachers in each department, in order to arrange a plan of
combined action in teaching, and to consider and determine a
scheme of lectures, such scheme to be submitted to the Board,

ai'd, if approved by the Board, published at the beginning of
the academical year by its authority.
Further, the Board thinks it desirable that the university
should appoint, from time to lime, on the recommendation of
the Boards ol Studies, lecturers on any subject or subjects which
may not at the time l>e adequately represented by professors,
inter-collegiate lecturers, or other teacher.".
(i) The Board is not prepared to suggest any further provi-
sion for the organisation of the professorial lectures in its depart-
ment.
With respect to inter-collegiate lecture-;, the control exercised
by the Board over the authoritative publication of the scheme
drawn up after consultation with the professors would, it is
hoped, be sufficient for the effective organisation of the whole
system.
(c) The power given to the Board of Studies of remitting for
farther consideration any scheme of professors' lectures which
the Board disapproves, may be used to prevent any undue inter-
ference of one professor with ^departments properly belonging
to another.

film of silver is deposited, is placed in the focus ot the eye-lens;
transparent lines are drawn on the film, instead of wires, and as
the star passes across the lines it is seen to flash out brightly.
The film of silver is made sufficiently thin to permit of the star
being seen when it is between the lines, but it appears that the
lines themselves are only visible, except in the case of very large
stars, when the star disc is in transit across a line. Capt.

Dr. Vogel, in 1874, and more recently Capt. Waterhouse, had

a red dye the collodion was found to be most sensitive to the red
end of the spectrum. He had repeated these experiments, and
had obtained only partial success; he had, however, from con-
sidering the chemistry of the question raiher than the physical
explanation which had been given and which he believed to be
a mistake, been led to try other experiments as to mixing gum
resins with the collodion, and had obtained a compound which
was very sensitive to the long wave-lengths, so that he had been
able to obtain distinct traces of the spectrum beyond A. He

a Btirsen burner, first, when in its ordinary condition, and after-
wards with the air openings at the base closed. It was shown
that, whereas in the first case the effect produced was equivalent
to three divisions of the scale, in the latter case one-teuth of the
current produced by the exposure deflects the needle to the end
of the scale. Prof. Johnstone Stoney then explained the theory
which he has suggested in explanation of the phenomena observed
in the radiometers of Mr. Crookes, which has been published in
the Philosophical Magazine for the current month. The theory
rests on the supposition that there is an excessively small trace of
residual gas in the sphere in which the moving discs are enclosed.
When the apparatus is exposed to heat the blackened side of
the disc is slightly warmed, and this warms a layer of air in con-
tact with it. At the ordinary atmospheric pressure, Prof. Stoney
assumes the layer so warmed to have the thickness of a sheet of
paper, when the temperature of the disc is 20° C. above that of
the surrounding air, and on such a supposition we may calculate
it for any other pressure and temperature. If we diminish the
pressure the thickness varies inversely as the pressure raised to
the power J. Thus if the disc be raised TV° C. above the sur-
rounding air, and the exhaustion carried to the yiriinr'h of an
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
atmosphere, the layer will have a thickness of more than a deci-
metre, and the effect of the air will then be peculiar. If the gas
is of such a density that the glass envelope is beyond the range
of this action, the gas beyond the limiting distance will be cold,
but if the effect reach the glass, conduction will take place to it.
There will then be a procession of warm molecules towards the
glasy, where they will be cooled down, and form a number of
cold, slow-moving molecules, which will go back to the disc and
beyond it. And these processions will be intermixed with mole-
cules taking no part in the action. In consequence of this, very
few members will travel far in their paths; a portion of the
motion of each, however, will be carried forward in the
right direction. So long as these processions go on, the
slow-moving molecules which reach the front of the disc

Stoney considers the pressure thus produced to be that mea-
sured by Mr. Crookes. With a pressure of the gas of
iiTi<rotn of an atmosphere, an elevation of temperature of ,V° C.
will produce the fores actually observed, while if the exhaustion
be carried to Tuwisjth the elevajion of temperature necessary
will be jV C. Thus with the greater pressure a lower tempe-
rature will suffice, but other influences .will then be brought into
play tending in an opposite direction. It was pointed out that
on this theory the action maybe considered as closely resembling
electricity, and Mr. Crookes has shown that the glass envelope

BLASIUS ON STORMS
Storms; their Nature, Classification, and Laws, with the
Means of Predicting them by their Embodiments, the
Clouds. By William Blasius, formerly Professor of the
Natural Sciences in the Lyceum of Hanover. (Phila-
delphia: Porter and Coates. London: Lock wood and
Co.)
WHATEVER may be thought of this work as a con-
tribution to the extremely difficult question of the
theory of storms, its delightful "positiveness of state-
ment born of conviction," makes it a very readable book;
and, further, the fresh facts contained in its pages, collected
in most cases with evident care, form a useful repository
to meteorologists in the study of atmospherical disturb-
ances. In matters pertaining to general meteorology, the
author is less at home as regards his facts, such as when
he states that the heat of the sun's rays scarcely pene-
trates an inch into the surface of the land in the course
of a day. He is also at fault as regards the seasonal dis-
tribution of atmospheric pressure over the globe, and the
extent over which the south-west monsoon spreads to

westward off the coast of Africa.
A storm is defined to be "in general the movement of
the air caused by its tendency to re-establish an equili-
brium which has in some manner been disturbed, and we
may call all such movements storms, whether they are
gentle breezes or furious hurricanes, whether they are
accompanied by more or less condensation of moisture or
clouds, or even by none at all; in general the laws of the
motion and changes of the wind in re-establishing an
equilibrium must be the same, whether the action takes
place in a greater or less degree " (p. 43), and the author
"is certain that the storm is the conflict of air-currents
of different temperatures, and that the barometric de-
pression is the effect of their movement" (p. 5). Thus
storms are considered in a very broad sense,—in fact, they
are regarded as synonymous with the whole atmospheri-
cal movements, and the book is therefore an attempt
to state the theory of the circulation of the atmosphere.
Since the disturbances which occur in the distribution
of the temperature and humidity of the air are either ver-
tical or horizontal, it follows that the equilibrium will be
restored either by the setting in of ascending or descend-
ing currents of air, or by the setting in of horizontally-
flowing currents. Observation affords abundant proofs
of the existence of all these types of aerial movements.

In accordance with this conception of atmospherical dis-
turbances and consequent movements which follow, Prof.
Blasius classes all storms under three heads, viz. :—1.
Local or vertical storms, which are stationary and centri-
petal, being produced by the atmosphere tending to re-
establish in a vertical direction an equilibrium that has
been disturbed; the characteristic cloud being the cumulus.
2. Progressive or lateral storms which travel, being pro-
duced by the atmosphere tending to re-establish in a
lateral direction an equilibrium which has been disturbed.
This second class of storms are of two kinds, viz., equa-
torial or north-east storms (winter storms), which are pro-
duced by a warm current displacing a cool one to supply

a deficiency towards the poles, the temperature changing
from cool to warm, the direction in which they travel
being to the north-east quadrant, and their characteristic
cloud being the stratus. Polar or south-east and south-
west storms (summer storms), which are produced by a
cool current displacing a warm one to supply a deficiency
toward the equator, the temperature changing from warm

one hand, and to polar regions on the other, or even to
have had their origin in these regions; and that the idea
of two great atmospheric currents having in storms a
common plane of meeting (Begegnungs-flache) is a mere
supposition. Such statements as these: "The storm is
the conflict of air-currents," and "the barometric depres-
sion is the effect of their movement," are, to say the least,
altogether unwarranted in the present state of our know-
ledge.
The tornado is conceived as originating from the sultry
calm felt before it, which is due to the conflicting of the
two aerial currents, bringing about a state of equilibrium
by the great compressive force they exert against each
other. This equilibrium is disturbed by a particular
uneven configuration of the earth's surface, and the dis-
turbance produces the tornado. Leaving out of view the
imagining action of conflicting aerial currents, it will be
enough to point to the geographical distribution of tor-
nadoes as disproving this theory of their origin.
Notwithstanding these very serious drawbacks, the
book will repay perusal as being the production of one

who not unfrequently gives evidence of acute observation,
and who has thought out his subject for himself. The
following may be given as specimens of what are re-
peatedly to be met with :— " Meteorology is fully as much
a science of the earth's surface as of the air." "The
wind changes, not by the veering around of one and the
same current, but by a succession of different currents,
blowing inwards." "Among the meteorological elements
the real direction of the wind is the most difficult to arrive
at, especially at observatories above cities or near moun-
tains and coasts, and wind observations are therefore in
general the least reliable." "The thermometer, as mea-
suring a primaiy effect, is, with the hygrometer, at least
as important as the barometer."
The theory of atmospheric movements remains still to
be stated, and it needs scarcely be added that this cannot
be done till we have a better knowledge than we yet pos-
sess of the physics of the atmosphere with its vapour,
and of the merely mechanical effects of ascending,
descending, and horizontally-flowing currents of air.

MANY details concerning the latter of the expeditions
referred to in this volume have been made known
in this country through the daily papers, in connection
with the much-to-be regretted murder of Mr. A. R. Mar-
gary. Indeed, Dr. Anderson states that his work was
suggested by the interest called forth by the repulse of
the recent mission and the tragedy attending it. The
principal object of both expeditions was to prepare the
way for establishing an overland trade-route between
Burmah and China, and thus save the delay and expense
of a roundabout sea voyage. That the establishment of
such a route is desirable from a commercial point of view
is maintained by all who have a knowledge of the cir-
cumstances, and in the meantime appears to have been
frustrated by the machinations of native traders who
think it their interest to shut out British enterprise from
a field which is evidently capable of great development.

The Kakhyens especially are a very interesting race.
They inhabit the mountains on the border-country be.
tween Burmah and China, and Dr. Anderson considers
them as cognate with the hill tribes of the Mishmees and
Nagas. The name Kakhyen is a Burmese appellation
and the people are widely spread under other names,
as Singphos, Kakoos, &c. They do not seem, however,
to be a genuine aboriginal population in Burmah and
China as so many hill-tribes are elsewhere.
"By their own account the hills to the north of the
Tapeng, for a month's journey, are occupied by kindred
tribes. South of the Tapeng, they occupy the hills as far
as the latitude of Tagoung, and, as mentioned, were met
with on our voyage near the second defile. To the east,
they are found occupying the hills, and, intermixed with
the Shans and Chinese, almost to Momien. Here they,
as it were, run into the Leesaws, who may be a cognate,

strongly of that which prevailed in the Scottish High-
lands in the so-called "good old times," before the aboli-

curious superstitions and customs, which Dr. Anderson
describes with great minuteness. Everything in "the
heavens above, the earth beneath, and the waters under
the earth" seems to have its particular "nat" or spirit;
"every accident or illness is the work of some malignant
or vindictive one of 'these viewless ministers.'" The
will of these "nats" is consulted by means of a tnedium,
who works himself up into a state of great agitation, so as
to become " possessed." The Kakhyens are not very bold
warriors, though they are great braggarts, and very
troublesome to deal with. They are altogether a very
interesting people.
With regard to the wide-spread Shan race, also, many
details will be found in the volume, the result both of Dr.

hills of the Tapeng valley are the Lakone and Kowrie or
Kowlie, but numerous subdivisions of clans occur. All
are said to have originally come from the Kakoos'country,
north-east of Mogoung; and Shans informed us that two
hundred years ago Kakhyens were unknown inSandaand
Hotha valleys. To give one instance of their migrations.
The Lakone tribe have at a very recent period driven the
Kowlies from the northern to the southern banks of the
Tapeng. A Lakone chief, having married the daughter

of a Kowlie, asked permission to cultivate land belonging
to his father-in-law j receiving a refusal, he took forcible
possession, and drove the Kowlies across the river to the
hills where they now dwell."
The Kakhyens are divided into numerous tribes or
clans, between which there does not appear to be any
strong common bond of union. Indeed, in very many

Tay-Shan or Great Shans of the Tai-race, the branches
of which, under different names, are found extending to
the eleventh parallel, their various states being tributary
to Siam, Burmah, and China. The Shans of Burmah
have become closely assimilated to the Burmese in all
respects; the Yunnan Shans are the remnants of the
Shan Kingdom of Pong, conquered by the Chinese
in the fourteenth century, and which included part of
Burmah.

is slightly observable. The Shan face is usually short,
broad, and flat, with prominent malars, a faint obliquity
and contraction of the outer angle of the eye, which is
much more marked in the true Chinese. The nose is
well formed, the bridge being prominent, almost aquiline,
without that breadth and depression characteristic of the
Burman feature. The lower jaw is broad and well deve-
loped; but pointed chins below heavy, protruding lips
are not infrequent. Oval faces laterally compressed,
with retreating foreheads, high cheek-bones, and sharp
retreating chins, are not infrequent; and the majority of
the higher classes seemed to be distinguished from the
common people by more elongated oval faces and a de-
cidedly Tartar type of countenance. The features of the
women are proportionately broader and rounder than
those of the men, but they are more finely chiselled, and
wear a good-natured expression, while their large brown
eyes are very scantily adorned with eyebrows and eye-
lashes. They become much wrinkled by age, and,
judging from the numbers of old people, appear to be a
long-lived race. They are by no means a tall people,

the average height for men scarcely reaching five feet
eight, while the women are shorter and more squat in
figure.
A minute account of these people, their manners, cus-
toms, dress, &c, is given by Dr. Anderson. Some of the
ornaments worn by the women are of most artistic work-
manship.
The latter part of the volume contains a clear account
of the second expedition undertaken to open a trade
route between Burmah and China, but which, as we
have said, came tq an untimely and sad end about
a year ago in the murder of Mr. A. R. Margary. Dr.
Anderson sets ff^h the whole circumstances with evi-
dent fairness, and yet it is difficult to say exactly who
was to blame in the matter. That such a trade-route
as it was attempted to establish would be of great ad-
vantage to all concerned, there is no doubt; and no
doubt also it only requires time to establish it. There
is yet a very great deal tp be learned both with regard to
thejiatural history of that part of the world, and with regard
to the several interesting races of people which form its
population. Dr. Anderson's work is a valuable contribu-
tion to such a knowledge, and the clear and straightfor-
ward manner in which he writes adds greatly to the
intrinsic interest of the information with which his pages

follow satisfactorily the footsteps of the explorers.
OUR BOOK SHELF
A Class-book of Chemistry. By Edward L. Youmans,
M.D. (London: Henry S. King and Co., 1876.)
"This book is not designed as a manual for special chemi-

class, both in and out of school, who would like to know
something of the science, but who are without the oppor-

and descriptions of the most important substances, and
is not to be judged of by the fulness of its details." This
extract from the author's preface sufficiently explains the
objects which he has had in view in compiling the book
before us. Certainly the work has no claims as a text-

Water-supply of the Metropolis
I have no intention of enteiing into a controversy in your
columns with my friend Dr. Frankland, but his letter in your
impression of March 16 seems to requite some reply.
When I made the remarks which are called in question by Dr.
Frankland, I was careful to say that I might not unfaiily be
accused of having done so from interested motives, an admission
of which no one who reads Dr. Frankland's letter can say that
he has not taken the full advantage. I am not ashamed of my
occupation, and am quite ready to admit another historical
parallel afforded by Jack Cade, and confess that I, or those who

have gone before me, "against the king, his crown, and dignity,
have built a paper-mill." But, whether paper-manufacturers
"in the exercise of what they call their rights are polluters of
streams or no, is a question into which I never entered, and is
entirely beside the points which I raised.
These are in the main avoided by Dr. Frankland. The two
Commissioners, a portion of whose report I criticised, and of
whom it is as well to observe Dr. Frankland is one, recommend
that the Thames and the Lea should be entirely abandoned as
sources of supply for domestic use in London, and particularly
refer to the Chalk in the neighbourhood of London, and not to
the distant springs of the upper Thames as the future source of
supply. In his letter to you Dr. Frankland states that "The
Commissioners advise that the drinking water of London should
continue to be derived from its present sources, Lut that it should
be led away to its destination before it is mixed with the sewage
of Oxford, Reacing, Windsor, and other towns, and before it is
fouled by the filthy discharges of paper-mills, and by other dis-
gusting refuse." I presume that these two statements can be
reconciled, but looking at the proposal that the water should be
procured "within a moderate distance of I^ondon " the calcula-
tions as to the area of 849 square miles of Chalk and Upper Green-
smd within thirty miles of London, and looking at the enormous
expense of conveying water more than thirty miles, I took that
radius as representing the area out ol which some district was to

be placed under unnatural conditions with regard to its springs
and streams, in order to supply our vast metropolis, which I am
told it is contemptuous to term "overgrown." I never spoke of
the fertile meadows of the Thames valley, about which Dr. Franl.-
land makes merry, and I never intentionally alluded in the
slightest degree to the main valley ot the Thames, except to say
that both below and above London there might be spots in it
from which a limited supply of water might be pumped without
much injury to the neighbouring property. My comments were
intended to be confined to districts in «Inch the proposal of the
Commissioners could be carried out of sinking wells below the
present spring-heads, and so constantly drawing upon them that
there should be alwa)s a void below the level at which the
drainage naturally escapes. If this dees not mean the drying up
of the streams by cutting away their natural sources of supply I
shall be glad to know what it does mean.
If Dr. Frankland were as well acquainted as I am with the
gravelly soil of some of the low meadows in Chalk districts, he
would cease to be surprised at the possibility of their being con-
verted into "arid wastes" by the abstraction of the water with

Metachromism
A few words of explanation may seem necessary after Mr.
Ackroyd's observations (Nature, vol. xiii. p. 385) on my pre-
vious letter regarding the above subject.
The question as to whether a change of composition can be
said to produce or to accompany changes of physical properties, is
a matter of words which the chromium series does not affect, as
the relative number of atoms of the two elements is the test of
arrangement followed.
With regard to the two colour scales—one co-existent with
alterations of composition, the other with alterations of tempe-
rature—I never wished to "criticise" Mr. Ackroyd's results,
but solely to point out a resemblance which I had observed a
few years ago, and which I was not aware that that gentleman
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
had noticed. The two series need not necessarily be similar;
and, whatever other reasons may exist for placing white in the
ultra-violet, the question in hand is not whether the ultra-violet
rays produce the same sensation on our eyes as a mixture of all
the colours, but, Do the white compounds in question, when spec-
troscopically examined, only show the ultra-violet, leaving the
rest of the range in darkness, or do they show a complete spec-
trum? If the first, then of course their place of classification
would be in the ultra-violet; but if they give a whole spectrum
(as the compounds do to which I referred), then they must be
classed as having an average refrangibility greater than yellow light
(became they have blue in addition to it), and less than blue light
(because they have yellow also), for the centre of luminosity (on
c ach side of which the total of light rays is balanced) falls in the
green.
If we had only to deal with monochromatic substances, then
ol course the usual pan-spectral white would not need to be con-
sidered, and green (as Mr. Ackroyd says) would be the only
appearance to be clawed between blue and yellow.
Thus "the assertion that white comes between yellow and
blue "does not "rest upon the colour relation found to obtain
between the oxides of the alkali metals," though it is in accord-
ance with the rule given on p. 347, in the six sets of the oxides
and chloiides there mentioned ; the sole case not agreeing with
it being that of the chromium chlorides, wh'ch, however, may
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be accounted for.
As to the orange colour of NajO., as Miller does not mention
any colour, Turner was referred to ; and if he is in error, that one
instance may be laid aside; in any case it does not affect the
relative natural order of blue and white.

When I wrote the letter to the Times about Socotra, alluded

Wellsted, published in the Geographical Society's Journal for
1835 (Joum. R. Geog. Soc. v., p. 129). After perusing it I am
more than ever of opinion that Socotra is well worthy of the
attention of the naturalist, and may probably possess many most
interesting indigenous plants and animals. Unless matters are
very different from what they were in 1834, there can be little
difficulty in exploring the island, and if, as we are told, it has
really become British property, I trust we may not have to wait
much longer for some information about its zoology and botany.

Bullfinches and Primroses
I have a bullfinch which was hatched last summer after prim-
roses were over. They were therefore quite new to him when I
offered him the first I could get this season. He pulled it to
pieces quite indiscriminately, biting stalk, flower, or calyx quite
indifferently, and the same with a few more which were given to
him at the same time. But since then he has often had a few at
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
a time, perhaps twenty or thirty in all, and he now almost always
bites out the lower part of the calyx, as described in Nature,
vol. ix. p. 482. Sometimes he bites a little too high up, but
almost instantly tries again with better success. When that
part is eaten he attacks the stalk rather than the corolla.
Last spring I offered primroses to four bullfinches belonging
to friends. Not one seemed to pull the flower to pieces accord-
ing to any method. Two of them I saw only once. Another
(an old bird and somewhat shy), after being supplied with the
flowers for several days, seemed as unskilful in picking out the
tit bit as he was at first. The fourth was a young bird. His
mistress was called away before she had heard what was the
peculiarity for which 1 was watching. A few days later she told
me she had been giving him primroses in the meantime, and had
noticed that he ate only the green part. In those few days he
had learnt the art of primrose eating, not indeed quite perfectly,
but wonderfully well considering how little practice he had had.

author made experiments with several flowers which had suffi-
cient food at their disposal, and found that some of his flowers
changed their colour when placed in the dark, while it was not
so with others. Therefore it cannot be said that light has no
influence. The cause of this difference, observes the author, has
as yet not been explained; other experiments will have to be
made to clear up this point
I think the colour of most flowers is a thing that by con-
tinued inheritance during a very long lapse of time has become
almost constant, and cannot be changed in a few weeks or
months. Long-continued experiments with the same flowers
and their offspring would, perhaps, show more considerable
changes than Askenasy found.
So much for the point referred to by Mr. Dyer.
As to the seasonal order itself, a continuation of Mr. Alex-
ander Buchan's observations would be necessary, and probably
also experiments with the several parts of the spectrum to which
the flowers are to be exposed.

How Typhoid Fever is Spread
The case recently reported (Nature, voL xiii. p. 331) by
Prof. Frankland from a Swiss village, where the poison of typhoid
fever is said "to have filtered through a mile of porous soil, but
which had nevertheless lost none of its virulent properties," is
certainly so striking that some further reference to authorities
seems requisite. If it can be satisfactorily proved that this was
the most likely and reasonable origin of the case, it will give
additional weight to every endeavour for preserving our water
supply from every conceivable impurity ; but unless based on the
opinion of a competent and skilled investigator of such cases, it
will lay us open to the charge of receiving any similar statement
that favours our view, however rash. As medical officers of
health it is our duty frequently to trace the origin of cases of this
disease, and my anxiety to have further information of this case
will thus seem reasonable, and I hope will meet with some reply
from the distinguished professor. J. MITCHELL WILSON

There is no screw on the samara of the ash (Fraxinus excel-
sior) while it is green. The pitch of the screw, at the same date,
differs on different trees, and also on different seeds of the same
tree, and also on different parts of the same seed.
Why the wing generally becomes twisted as it dries is a very
interesting question. But what seems to me the most remark-
able fact about this phenomenon is, that in every case, and on
all trees alike, the thread of the screw is in one direction; that
direction being the same as in a cork-screw, or ordinary screw-
nail.
All varieties of the wild oat (Avenafatua) and the fly oat (Av.
sterilis) have long awns, which also in the green stage are straight,
but which in ripening become twisted. And in these also, the
direction of the screw is uniform and the same as in the ash
seed; but the pitch of the screw is variable.
Are these facts the same in other parts of the country? Are
the screws left-handed on the south of the equator?

DENCE AS TO THE ORIGIN OF EXISTING
VERTEBRA TE ANIMALS >
III.
IT will be necessary to preface our remarks as to the
origin of the next highest group of Vertebrates—that
of Reptiles—by some account of the distinction between
them and the Amphibia, and by some observations on
what zoologists mean by the terms " higher" and "lower"
as applied to animals or groups of animals.
In external form there is little difference between such
a reptile as a lizard, and such an amphibian as a newt,
and there seems, at first sight, to be no reason why they
should be placed in different primary groups. In former
times, as a matter of fact, the essential difference between
reptiles and amphibians was not seen, and the two were
united into a single class; but modern researches have
shown that, beneath this external similarity, lie great and
important differences, the chief of which we must now
consider.
In the first place, no reptile, at any period of its life,

possesses gills, and, in consequence, the breathing of air
dissolved in water •becomes impossible. Nevertheless,
reptiles, in common with all the higher animals, have, at
one period in their existence, slits leading from the throat
to the exterior, in precisely the same position as the
branchial clefts of an amphibian, but functionless.
Secondly, certain organs, known as "fcetal appen-
dages," are developed in connection with the young
animal before it leaves the egg, and serve a temporary
purpose in its economy. In the possession of these
appendages, as well as in the absence of gills, reptiles
agree with birds and mammals, and differ from fishes and
amphibians.
The young reptile is produced from an egg of relatively
large size, and consisting of a considerable mass of yolk,
surrounded by a quantity of transparent "white" or
albumen; the whole being invested by a hard or soft
shell. The yolk does not divide as a whole, but the pro-
cess of division is confined to a small patch on its surface;
in fact, the reptilian egg answers to the amphibian egg,
plus a quantity of additional matter, called accessory, or
food-yolk, which is unaffected by the process of yolk-
division. It is the small superficial patch, answering to
the whole amphibian egg, which is converted into the
body of the young reptile, the accessory yolk becoming
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
gradually smaller and smaller, as its substance is used up
in the nourishment of the embryo; in the meantime it
forms a bag attached to the umbilicus of the embryo, and
hence called the umbilical vesicle or yolk-sac; it is the
first of the fcetal appendages, and the only one which
occurs in any vertebrate below a reptile, being possessed
by certain fishes.
After the embryo has attained a certain size, and has
come to lie, like an inverted boat, on the yolk-sac, a fold
grows up, all round it, from the surface of the yolk, and,
the edges of the fold coming together above, a bag is
formed enclosing the embryo into the interior of which a
watery fluid is secreted, in which the little creature lies.
This natural water-bed is called the amnion; it is the
second of the fcetal appendages, and no trace of it is to
be found in any fish or amphibian.
The third and last of thesecurious embryonic appendages,
the allantois, grows out from the tail-end of the embryo
as a pear-shaped body, solid at first, but soon converted
into a sac, which extends round the embryo and yolk-sac,
immediately beneath the membrane of the shell. The

most of them are land animals, a few only being in-
habitants of fresh water, and one—the genus Ambly-
rhynchus of the Galapagos Archipelago—lives on the sea-
shore, and, if hard pressed, takes to the sea.
Through the whole of the Tertiary epoch the lizards
are essentially the same as those now existing. Some of
the Secondary species, also, have the same characters, but
in the chalk are found, in addition, strange marine lizards,
such as the genus Mosasaurus, which attained a length of
30 feet. As far back as the Purbecks, the lizards have verte-
brae like the existing kinds, but on descending to the Solen-
hofen slates we find abundant remains, which present the
lower character of bi- concave vertebrae, and the same is
true of all the still older forms, such as the Telerpeton of
the Triassic sandstones of Elgin and the Permian Proto-
rosaurus.
Thus the older lizards have a slightly simpler structure
than those of the present day, but resemble them, on the
whole, so closely, that we must conclude our existing
forms to have been derived from the ancient ones, and
have no need whatever to assume their special creation.

Lizards, then, offer another example of what is meant by
a persistent type.
A remarkable instance of this persistence is afforded
by a case of quite the same order as that of Ceratodus,
described in the first lecture. The Hatteria, mentioned
above, differs from all other lizards in many particulars.
Its jaws are armed with a horny beak, and its upper jaw
has two rows of teeth, one on the maxillary, the other on
the palatine bones ; the teeth of the lower jaw bite between
these, like a pair of scissors with a double upper blade.
The vertebrae are bi-concave, and, along the belly, arc
placed a number of bony plates.
No other existing form whatever is known presenting
these characters, but, about the year 1858, a number of
fossils were discovered in the sandstone of Elgin, and
amongst them the remains of a large lizard with bi-concave
vertebrae, abdominal plates, a horny beak, a double row of
upper jaw teeth, and, in fact, altogether like the existing
Hatteria.
The crocodiles are the only other reptiles the history of
which it will be possible to notice in this course. Two of
the most important characters by which they are distin-
guished from lizards are, the lodgment of the teeth in dis-
tinct sockets and the position of the hinder nostrils or
posterior nares. The maxillary, palatine, and pterygoid
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
bones are so disposed as to form a remarkable shelf or
partition in the roof of the mouth, thus bringing the
posterior nares to the hindermost part of the throat.
The soft palate forms a veil in front of these aper-
tures, and hangs down so as to rest on the back part of
the rudimentary tongue, and thus, except when the animal
is swallowing, entirely shuts off the cavity of the mouth
from the air passages. This arrangement has been prettily
explained by the crocodile's habit of killing its prey by
drowning; it is said that it can hold a captured animal
under water, while its own nostrils—placed at the end of
the long snout—are just above the surface, and thus is
enabled to breathe freely, the air passing through the
posterior nares, behind the veil of the palate, and so to
the lungs, while its prey is being suffocated. This is an
admirable explanation as far as the crocodile is con-
cerned, but, unfortunately, it is probably untrue, for pre-
cisely the same arrangement is found in the Gavial and
other crocodilians which live upon fish.

'"T"VHIS is the title of a paper which has been presented

meeting of the 24th ult., a description of the instrument
which he has designed with this object. He commenced
by giving a mathematical statement of the effect of local

and by substitution of 2 R for /; in this, Newton's state-
ment of the total attraction *-Rtt is obtained.
3
Now, if in place of the solid substance which forms the
exterior crust of the earth, whose density may be taken to
be the mean density of superficial rock, water, a material
of less density is substituted, it is shown that the total
attraction must be diminished, and the measure of this
diminution is a measure of the depth of light substance
which has been substituted for heavy. If we were in
possession of the exact mean density of the earth, of that
of the surface-rock, and of sea-water, a scale could be
calculated beforehand, to show what depth would agree
with a certain diminution of the measured effect of gravi-
tation. Such an approximate calculation was made in
designing the instrument, but Mr. Siemens has preferred
to compare the readings of the instrument with actual
soundings, in order to obtain a scale.
The instrument which is called a bathometer is repre-
sented in the accompanying illustration, and consists of
the following parts : a weight being a column of mercury
affected by variation of gravitation, a counterbalance being

springs unaffectedby variation of gravitauo.", md an arrange-
ment by which the variations in gravitation can be read as
depth in unit?. The column of mercury is maintained in
a vertical steel tube having cup-lika extensions, the lower
portion being closed by a corrugated diaphragm of thin
steel plate, and the upper portion containing an apertuie
for filling the instrument, having a screw stopper. The
internal diameter of the tube is reduced at the upper
portion, in order that the vertical oicillations of the
mercury produced by the motion of a vessel in a sea-way,
may be reduced to a minimum, and the instrument is
suspended in a universal joint above its centre of gravity,
so that it may always hang in a vertical position at sea,
and is enclosed in an air-tight casing so that it may not
be under the influence cf atmospheric changes. The
weight of the column of mercury is balanced at the centre
of the diaphragm by the elasticity of the steel springs,
and the modus operandi of the instrument is evident; as
the mercury diminishes in potential through the effects of
diminished attraction, the action on the springs diminishes,
and these shorten upon themselves.

432
\March 30, 1876
NATURE
the potential of the mercury should diminish in the same
ratio. Mercury contained in a tube of uniform section
would always have the same potential, for as it expanded
and lengthened by heat, its specific density would diminish,
and the product of density into height would remain
constant. If contained in a tube of infinitely small
diameter, compared with the diameter of the cup-like
extensions, the height would remain constant, whilst the
potential would diminish in the ratio of the expansion of
mercury, but this is different from the ratio of the diminu-
tion of potential of the springs, and in order that these
ratios may be accordant, or in other words that the equi-
librium of the whole system may be the same at all
temperatures, the peculiar form has been employed repre-
sented in the illustration, which is between the two forms
already referred to.
The amount of the variation of gravitation with varia-
tion of depth is exceedingly small, and requires some
method for indicating it. The method employed in the re-
sults hitherto tabulated and presented with the paper is by
means of electrical contact, which is established whenever

a sounding is to be taken, between the centre of the steel
diaphragm and the end of a micrometer screw, which is
at other times insulated from the body of the instrument.
The screw is of such pitch, and the circular plate which
turns with it has divisions so proportioned, that each
division represents a depth of one fathom.
The readings of the instrument have been compared
with soundings taken by means of Sir Win. Thomson's
steel wire sounding apparatus, and the accordance
between the two is very satisfactory, especially as the
bathometer, from the very nature of its action, gives
a mean of the surrounding depths, whilst the sounding-
line gives the actual depth below the ship. The reading
of the instrument is also effected by means of a spiral
glass tube, connecting by means of liquid, less dense than
mercury, with the mercury in the upper cup; this arrange-
ment has lately been tried and found to work successfully.
The instrument is also available for the measurement of
height; in mountain ascents, however, the elevated land
will influence its readings, and allowance would have to
be made for the effect of this local attraction.
The chief disturbing element in the use of this instru-
ment is the effect of latitude, which will have to be ascer-
tained approximately before its readings can be accepted
as true indications of the depth. The difference between
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the total attraction of the earth at the pole and on the
equator amounts to yJj> of its effect at the equator, the
rate of increase in travelling from the equator to the pole
being as the square of the sine of the latitude. The
amount of this variation is easily calculable in fathoms of
depth, to be tabulated for use with the instrument.
The principal value of the bathometer would be to
serve the mariner as an additional means of determining
his position when he was debarred from taking astrono-
mical observation on account of the state of the weather.
If the contour of the ocean bed were laid down on charts
more perfectly than it is at present, and if these were in
the hands of the mariner, he would be able to tell from
his bathometer what was the depth of ocean below him,
and whether that depth was increasing or decreasing in
pursuing his course; he could also observe the rate of
increase or decrease of depth, and in consulting his chart
he would be enabled to determine his actual position with
considerable accuracy, and thus be forewarned of the ap-
proach of danger.

The high price at which it is sold prevents many people
from buying it. It is for the purpose of rendering the
supply of this useful and healthful article abundant and
cheap that ice-making machines have been devised. These
are of three classes, of which we shall give a brief account
in order to show the advantages of the new invention, due
to the ingenuity of a young Genevese physicist, M. Raoul
Pictet.
The first class comprises the Ammoniacal Machines.
These are based on the principle, applied by M. Carrd, of
the solution of ammonia in water. A saturated solution
of ammonia is introduced into a boiler which is heated to
1400 or 150° C. The ammonia is disengaged under
strong pressure, and is liquefied in a condenser washed by
a current of ordinary water. The liquid ammonia flows
into the refrigerator, where it is evaporated and it returns
into the liquid in a gaseous form. The evapora-
tion is the source of the cold, which may be made very
intense.
In order to work an apparatus of this kind, it is neces-
sary that the first operation be effected, i.e., the liquefac-
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:53 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
tion of the ammonia in the condenser. For this purpose
it is necessary that the pressure in the boiler correspond
to the tension of ammonia vapour, at the temperature of the
water of condensation, 30° C. at least in warm countries.
This pressure is raised then to fifteen or eighteen
atmospheres, an enormous pressure, liable to great
danger.
Under so great tension the gas traverses cast-iron
walls of two centimetres, the joints leak, not being
air-tight, and the ammonia rapidly escapes from the
apparatus. The alkaline solution must then be constantly
renewed, which is very costly. There is another incon-
venience. The fire under the boiler causes deposits,
which, increasing day by day, give rise to the danger of
an explosion. The fear of such a catastrophe demands
constant watchfulness.
In countries less warm, with a water of condensation
at 20°, the tension of the ammonia hardly exceeds eight
atmospheres. In these circumstances the Carrd machine
works well and produces economical results. But in such
countries natural ice is abundant, and the service ren-
dered is consequently of less value.
The second class includes the Ether Machines. Sul-
phuric ether was first employed for the manufacture of ice
in England. A large pneumatic pump draws up the
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
vapours of ether, which are formed in a tubular refrige-
rator, and compresses these vapours in a condenser
bathed in spring water. The evaporation may also freeze
the water contained in the tanks, while the compression
of the vapours and their condensation in the condenser
transfer to the spring-water all the heat freed from the
water in the tanks, transformed into ice. A pipe allows
the condensed ether to return to the refrigerator, and be
again subjected to volatilisation.
These machines, more simple than the ammonia ones,
are, however, less workable. Ether is a liquid of small
volatility, and gives only weak tensions. At — 40 or - 5° C,
this tension varies from 4 to 8 centimetres of mercury
according to the quality of the ether. The cylinder of the
pneumatic machine must then be of considerable dimen-
sions in order to draw up a small weight of ether and
produce a limited amount of cold. The whole of the first
half of the machine works with an almost complete
vacuum, but if the joints, the walls of the tubes, and the
caulking of the cylinder are not perfectly hermetic, atmo-
spheric air will enter the apparatus; and should the ma-

machine, manufacturing 250 kilogrammes of ice per
hour:—
A cylindrical tubular copper boiler has a length of
2 metres and a diameter of 35 centimetres; 150 tubes of
15 millimetres traverse its entire length, and are soldered
by their extremities to the two ends. This first boiler is
the refrigerator. It is placed horizontally in a large
sheet-iron vat, which contains 100 tanks of 20 litres each.
An incongealable liquid, salted water, is constantly circu-
lating in the interior of the refrigerator by means of a
helix. This liquid is re-cooled to about — 7° in a normal
course, and it licks on its return the sides of the tanks
which contain the water to be frozen.
In the space reserved between the tubes of the refri-
gerator, the sulphurous acid liquid is volatilised, its
vapours are drawn up by an aspirating force-pump, which
compresses them without the condenser. This condenser
is a tubular boiler, the same as the refrigerator; only a
current of ordinary water passes constantly into the inte-
rior of the tubes to carry off the heat produced by the
change of the gaseous into the liquid state of the sul-

phurous acid, and by the work of compression. A tube
furnished with a gauge tap, adjusted by the hand once
for all, permits the liquefied sulphurous acid to return
into the refrigerator to be subjected anew to volatilisa-
tion.
Sulphurous acid has the exceptionally advantageous
property of being an excellent lubricant, so that the
metallic piston which works in the cylinder of the com-
pressing pump requires no greasing. Thus the introduc-
tion of foreign matter into the apparatus becomes entirely
impossible.
The work necessary to manufacture 250 kilogrammes
of ice per hour is at the most seven-horse power.
A cold of 7° in the bath is amply sufficient to obtain in
the tanks a rapid and in every way economical conge-
lation.
With these mechanical arrangements the following im-
portant advantages are realised :—1. The pressure never
exceeds four atmospheres. 2. There is never any entry
of air to fear, the pressures, as far as — io° C, being
always above that of the atmosphere. 3. The volatile
liquid employed is perfectly stable, undecomposable, and
without chemical action on metals. 4. All greasing in
the machine is dispensed with. 5. The volatile liquid is
obtained at a very low price, and it is accompanied by no
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
danger of explosion or fire. 6. The cost of production of
the ice approaches infinitely near to the theoretic mini-
mum: it is about 10 francs per ton of ice.
By means of all these advantages the practical problem
of the manufacture of ice may be considered as solved for
all climates, and the process of M. Pictet will not fail to
be speedily adopted in all warm countries as soon as it
becomes known; it is in such countries that its happy
results will be specially utilised and appreciated.
A small specimen of M. Pictet's machine will be shown
at the forthcoming Loan Exhibition of Scientific Apparatus
at South Kensington.

lecture at the Royal Institution on Friday evening. He told the
audience that "A wise man before building a structure first
examined the nature of the foundation," and he then proceeded
to inquire into the nature of the evidence upon which the calcu-
lations have been made, as to the rate of denudation of valleys,
the wearing back of sea coasts, the growth of peat-mosses,
and the deposition of alluvium. He endeavoured to show by
means of examples of exceptional phenomena, happening at long
intervals and lasting for indefinitely short periods, that such cal-
culations were utterly fallacious, and concluded by comparing
our position to that of a "man in a cockle-shell boat, trying to
sound an almost unfathomable ocean, firstly, with too short a
line; secondly, with too heavy a weight; and lastly, with a
weight so light that he was perfectly unaware when he
touched the bottom." "To doubt," a great biologist tells
us, "is the first principle of modern science," but in life, as
in art, there are lights as well as shadows, and geological
time is so intimately connected with the history of life upon
our globe, and with the knowledge we possess of past denuda-
tions that have produced those missing leaves in the chapters of
the earth's life history that geologist's call unconformities, that
we venture to think that though we may not have reached the
bottom of the deeper oceans, yet we have certainly sounded some
of the most shallow seas. We therefore look forward with
pleasure to hearing another lecture from Prof. Hughes, in which

EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ON THE
EFFECTS OF ELECTRICAL INDUCTION,
FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECTIFYING THE
THEORY COMMONLY ADOPTED1
'"THE theory generally adopted in treatises on Physics and
-*¦ Electricity to explain the fundamental fact of electrical in-
duction in an insulated cylinder A B, acted on by an electrified
body c, is as follows :—It is admitted that on the extremity n of
the induced cylinder, that is, the extremity next to the inductor G,
is found only the electricity opposite to that of the inductor;
while on the rest of the same cylinder is found only electricity
similar to 'that of the inductor. But these two opposite elec-
tricities are both supposed to be endowed with tension, conse-
quently they ought to be divided by a neutral line. When it is
wished to represent in a graphic manner the electrical distribution
indicated, obtained by induction upon the cylinder A n, this is
done by means of Fig. i. In this figure A B represents the
induced and insulated cylinder, c the positive inductor, a b the
neutral line, apb the negative induced electricity, which may
also be called induced electricity of the first kind, and a q b the
positive electricity, or induced electricity of the second kind.

It is obvious that the explanation commonly adopted for electric
induction cannot hold for the following three reasons :—I. Because,
as the two opposite electricities possess tension, they ought on
that account to neutralise each other as they are present on a
conducting cylinder. 2. Because in putting into communication
with the earth the extremity n of the induced cylinder, upon
which extremity it is admitted that the homonym of the inductor
is not found, nevertheless that only is dissipated, while the oppo-
site electricity, which is found on the same extremity, remains
there entirely, notwithstanding its communication with the earth.

Fig. i.
3. Because of the two kinds of eloclricity which coexist upon the
induced insulated body, only the homonym of the inductor is
dissipated by contact with the air. The experimental proofs
upon which this old theory is based do not prove the fact! indi-
cated while the action of c is being exerted, contrary to what is
state! in treatises on Physics. But in what folbws we shall give
other experimental ani irrefragable proofs to demonstrate that
the explanation indicated is not admissible.
Mclloni * having discovered that the above-mentioned explana-
tion was altogether erroneous, proposed ano'her, which is as
follows -.—Upon the induced and insulated cylinder A B is found
tverywhere electricity of the same kind as that of the inductor, i.e.,
induced electricity of the second kind ; but to a much greater

degree at the extremity A. furthest from the inductor and much
less at the extremity n nearest to the same inductor. As to
induced electricity of the first kind, it does not possess any
tension, i.e., it is entirely latent (dissimulated) on the extre-
mity H, nearest to the inductor, and proceeding from this extre-
mity B towards the extremity A, furthest from the same inductor,
it always goes on diminishing. It is for this reason that upon
the induced insulated body there is a section in which the induced
electricity of the first kind, entirely concealed, will be equal to
that of the second kind, entirely free. Also these two opposite
electricities may coexist upon the induce! and insulated cylinder,
without neutralising each other.
In order to represent graphically this electrical distribution,
obtained by induction upon the cylinder A B, and regarded as
true by Melloni, let us make us; of Fig. 2. In this figure A B
represents the induced and insulated cylinder, c represents the
positive induction, a b the section of electricities equal to each
other but of opposite kinds; m, a, p, b, n, the induced of the
first kind, and a, q, b, h the induced electricity of the second
kind, i.e. the homonym of the inductor.
The new theory of Melloni, the truth of which I have proved

43«
{March 30, 1876
NATURE
that he is not able exactly to assign the true cause of certain facts
relative to electric induction, in the phenomenon in question.
We shall see in what follows, that nothing remains obscure in
the theory developed by Melloni, when we reflect on the exist-
ence of what is called curvilinear induction, which was dis-
covered by Faraday, and which is now acknowledged as a reality
by all those who have kept themselves abreast of electrostatic
science.
All that we have indicated in order to render clear the explana-
tion given by Melloni of the electrostatic fact of which we have
spoken, will be proved with a much greater amount of evidence
by the experiments which follow. But, before describing them,
it will be useful to give a britf historic sketch of the researches
of different physicists as to the effect of electrical induction.
The greater part of these researches are favourable to the theory
of Melloni, while some are opposed to it. This theory will be
acknowledged as true when it is proved that the induced electricity
of the first kind does not possess any tension, or, what comes to
the same thing, when it is proved that the homonym of the in-
ductor exists also in the extremity B of the induced and insulated
cylinder.

Historical. — Electrostatic induction, or electrical influence,
was first observed by Canton in 1753 (Phil. Trans, vol. 48, part i.,
p. 350). Franklin continued his researches, but Wilke and
VEpinus gave a greater development to the discovery indi-
cated.1 We conclude from the works of Canton that this physi-
cist knew also the induction now called curvilinear; for he
indicates several circumstances depending on the same pheno-
menon. The first who recognised, more tlian 100 years ago, that
induced electricity of the first kind, that is with the sign opposite
of the induction, does not possess tension, was /Kpinus." Subse-
quently Lichtenberg clearly announced that induced electricity
of the first kind has no tension.3 De Luc was also of the same
opinion,4 as also the celebrated Volta.5 This Italian physicist"
admitted the want of tension in the induced electricity opposite
to that of the inductor, and admitted moreover that the electrical
influence is exercised by means of a partial dissimulation of the
inducing electric ty, and the entire dissimulation of the induced
electricity with opposite sign, a fact which is always verified.
It seems that the question whether or not induced electricity of
the first kind can have tension, was discussed for the first time
by Lord Mahon and Volta, about 1787, to judge from what De
Luc says.7
Among no'able physicis s who afterwards admitted that in-
duced electricity of the first kind has no tension—before that
doctrine was reproduced in a more developed form by Melloni,
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
July 25, 1854—we must also reckon Fischer. This will be seen
in reading Fischer's "Mechanical Physics," translated by Biot
(4th ed., Paris, 1830^.238-242). The ph>sicist PfalTadmitted
completely the want of tension in induced electricity of the first
kind.8
The celebrated Ohm, in a paper "On an unrecognised
property of latent electricity," criticises Pfaff, and concludes that
it is not true that induced electricity of the first kind has no
tension.9 Consequently if Ohm had known of the existence of
the influence named curvilinear, he would, by means of his
experiments, have arrived at the contrary conclusion. The cur-
vilinear influence discovered by Faraday, was unknown also to
Melloni, but, however, he did not fail to recognise the truth that
the induced electricity opposite to that of the induction does not
possess tension.
C. F. Mohr, a Coblentz pharmacist, criticises Pfaff, stating
that in his experiments, the induced cylinder received the elec-
tricity by communication.'0 But we know that by operating on
a very dry day, such communication does not take place; and
yet by experimenting well, the result obtained by Pfaff is ob-
tained, which triumphantly refutes Mohr.11

the precipitation of clay suspended in water, by Mr. Wm. Ramsay
Principal Assistant in Glasgow University Laboratory. Com-
municated by Prof. Ramsay, F.R.S., V.P.G.S. The author
referring to the fact that clay when suspended in water in
excessively minute particles, settles more rapidly when the water
contains salts in solution, noticed the opinions expressed by pre-
vious writers on the subject, and gave the results of experiments
made by him, from which it would appear that the rapidity of
precipitation is proportionate to the amount of heat absorbed by
the salts in process of solution. By another series of experiments
he found that the fluidity of the respective solutions had apparently
no influence on the rapidity of deposition of the clay. He also
found that clay is deposited less quickly in acid solutions than in
solutions of salts, and more rapidly in a solution of caustic soda

than in one of caustic potash. In solutions of common salt of
different strengths he found that clay settled in the inverse order
of their specific gravities. From all these results the author is
inclined to attribute the varying rapidity of the settling of clay
suspended in saline solutions to the varying absorption of heat
by the solutions. When water containing suspended clay was
heated, the rapidity of the settling of the clay was proportionate
to the heat of the water. The author suggests that the increased
rapidity of settlement may be due to the greater amplitude of
vibration of the molecules of water when heated; the vibrations
being performed in equal times, particles descending at right
angles to the plane of vibration will experience less resistance
from the molecules of water. A note by Prof. Ramsay, briefly
indicating some of the geological bearings of these results, was
appended to the paper.—2. On some Fossiliferous Cambrian
Shales near Carnarvon. By Mr. J. E. Marr. Communicated
by Prof. T. McKenny Hughes, F.G.S. With an Appendix, by
Mr. Henry Hicks. Tl e shales described by the author extend
from about three miles S.W. of Carnarvon to Bangor, running
nearly parallel to the Menai Straits. They are faulted against
Lower Cambrian to the east, and disappear against a dyke on
the west. The shales vary from greyish black to bluish black
in colour, and are generally sandy and micaceous, but in places
chiefly clayey. Fossils were obtained from three places on the
banks of ihe Seiont, namely, near Point Seiont (where the beds
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
are concretionary in structure), along the old tramway from
Carnarvon to Wanttle, and near Peblig Bridge. The first-named
locality is richest in fossils; and here there is a greenstone dyke,
parallel to the bedding of the rock, and altering the shales for a
distance of about four yards from the edge of the dyke. The
fossils seem to indicate that the deposit belongs to the upper
part of the Arenig group. Mr. Hicks pointed out that the fauna
clearly showed thatthesj beds belong to the Arieng group, many
of the species being identical with those found in the upper part
of that group at St. David's Shelve, and in Cumberland. The
new species found by Mr. Marr are a Caiyocaris (C. Marrii)
and an ALglina {A. Hut-hesii). The oiher lossils were Didymo-
graptus indentus, D. bifidui, D. Murchitoni, and the var. furcil-
latus. Species of Barrandea, TrinucUus, Lingula, Obolella,
Discina, See, and Orthoceras cacresiense. The rock in its general
character is extremely like that at the same horizon in the
succession at St. David's Shelve, and in Cumberland, and indi-
cates, therefore, the prevalence of similar physical conditions
when deposited. The rock is such as would be formed over an
even sea-bottom at come considerable distance from land and in
moderate deep water. Mr. Hicks looked upon this discovery as

PREECE'S TELEGRAPHY
Telegraphy. By W. A. H. Preece, C.E., Divisional Engi-

Superintendent (Engineering Department) Post Office
Telegraphs. (London: Longmans, Green and Co.,
1876.)
IT is with feelings of great disappointment that we lay
down the latest book on Telegraphy. In a work
professedly a text-book of science, one of the series that
contains Clerk Maxwell's Heat, Jenkin's Electricity, Good-
eve's Mechanism, and the books of Bloxam and of Miller,
we certainly were not prepared to find the part of science
consistently left out. We considered, in fact, that when
two authors, high in their profession, undertook to supple-
ment a recognised want in so distinguished a series of
text-books, we might expect to receive from them the best
and the newest information obtainable on the subject that
they profess to deal with.
In the last twenty years the advances in our knowledge
of the science of electricity and magnetism and of the
principles of telegraphy, a branch of electrical science
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
applied, have been very great and very important. The
science and the practical application of electricity have
occupied a large part of the attention of the foremost inves-
tigators in physical science. The labours of Gauss, Weber,
Faraday, Joule, Helmholtz, Thomson, Maxwell, and of the
celebrated British Association Committee on Standards
of Electric Resistance have given to the student on the
one hand and to the practical engineer on the other, a
system of laws, of methods of calculation, and of experi-
mental results as to properties of matter, that make the
science of electricity perhaps the most exact of all the
branches of Natural Philosophy. To ignore every exact
principle from first to last of a science so well founded,
and to substitute for a clear statement of these well-
known principles a few sketchy paragraphs not worthy of
the middle of last century, is not, in our opinion, the
proper introduction to a scientific text-book on Telegraphy
for beginners.
The authors of the work before us naturally think that
"Electricity being its; main theme a certain acquaintance
with the elementary principles of that science must be
assumed on the part of the reader." However, "the
differences which exist among electricians with respect to
the signification of many of the technical terms employed
in connection with telegraphy render it necessary that the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
student at the outset should have a clear comprehension
of the meaning of those which will be used in this work."
Accordingly they proceed to give him a "clear" idea of
"Electric quantity," "electric potential," "electric re-
sistance" in the following way :—
"Electricity is an agent pervading terrestrial and solar
space, and is as universal in its effects as are heat and
light. We are cognisant of its existence when we hear
the roar of thunder and see the (lash of lightning, but we
do not know its particular form any more than we know
that of heat or that of light. The sound of the thunder

"Potential," we learn, "implies 'that function of
electricity -which determines its motion from one point to
another."
We doubt whether the elementary student will obtain
from this definition (?) or from the accompanying explana-
tions, any criterion for knowing a point of high potential
from a point of low potential, or any idea of how to reckon
numerically the potential at a point, or even the difference
of potentials between two points.
Next we learn that " Resistance implies that quality
of a conductor in virtue of which it prevents more than
a certain amount of work being done in a given time by a
given electromotive force." This is prefaced by the extra-
ordinary remark that "The transference of electricity,
such as that from a charged cloud to the earth, from a
rubbed glass to a rubbed comb, a signal from Europe to
America, may take place in different times; the path
between A and B offers obstruction to the passage of
electricity; the medium through which it passes ... is
an obstacle to be overcome." The unit of resistance is, it
is said, called the Ohm, from Ohm the German physicist,

but the laws of Ohm are not stated, nor is the beginner
even told to connect with them the idea of diminishing
the current between two points by increasing the resist-
ance between them; and with the exception of the mys-
terious and inaccurate reference to work done, just quoted,
(and the work done in the circuit by no means presents
itself directly to the attention of the beginner in electrical
studies), there is nothing to afford a clue to the effect of
the resistance in a given circuit. This remarkable chapter
concludes as follows :—
"The nature of electricity itself is not known, nor is
it necessary to the telegraphist that it should be known
by him. He is only interested in its quantitative mea-
surement and its application to practical purposes. Let
him master its elementary principles, its general ideas, its
properties and its conditions, and he can well afford to
leave to physicists the discussion of its nature, and to
mathematicians the determination of its laws."
We have no objection to these general sentiments, but
we venture to think that for any one who wishes to write
a book on telegraphy a moderate amount of attention to
what the naturalist (we can't call him physicist) and mathe-
matician have to impart would not be out of place.
We are far from satisfied with the chapter on bat-
teries and with the chapters on construction ; in fact our

idea of what the artisan class and the beginners in science
schools should expect to learn from a text-book of science
in no way agrees with the ideas of the authors of this
book. We cannot think that the last chapter (fifteen
pages), describing the message-forms used in the British
postal telegraphs, and a mass of technicalities even to the
inserting of the received message in an envelope and
handing it to the messenger, will be of use to anyone.
And yet the dimensions allowed for the book have com-

ruplex, multiplex, and other novel systems of telegraphy

and the apparatus depending upon them are not dealt
with." Everything scientific is in fact left out.
There is a mass of technicality in the chapter on
batteries, of which a host are described with their prices,

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AT SOUTH
KENSINGTON
A Descriptive Catalogue of the Musical Instruments in
the South Kensington Museum. Preceded by an Essay
on the History of Musical Instruments. By Carl Engel.
Second Edition.
THE collection of musical instruments in the Museum
at South Kensington is one of considerable and of
varied interest. Consisting, as it does mainly, of the
instruments employed by various nations within the last
few centuries, it exemplifies the improvements in art and
the gradual development of scientific principles in con-
struction. But it includes also instruments of more remote
d»tcs such as would range within "the middle ages," and
a few of prehistoric period. In the last case a similarity
of musical instruments and of musical systems may be
an important assistance in determining the ethnology of
an extinct people, while the practice of opposite systems
by neighbouring races will be a strong inference that they
sprung from different stocks.
The excellent Catalogue, of which we have now a

second edition, includes a prefatory essay by M. Carl
Engel on the early history of musical instruments, and he
has enhanced its utility by adding the scale of notes
which many of the instruments would produce. This
was practicable in the case of pipes, flutes, or other wind
instruments from extant examples, but not with such as
were stringed, because they would not remain in tune.
When a nation is found to have employed instruments
constructed for the diatonic octave scale, such as the
intervals of our A B C D E F G A, it is a proof that the
possessors practised harmony, although it may have been
but to a limited extent. The reason is that the fourth and
seventh notes of such scales require different basses to
the others, and would not be agreeable to the ears
without the addition of such basses. On the other
hand, if we find a scale of but five notes within an
octave, the two omitted will be the fourth and seventh
of the scale on that very account. We may in such cases
conclude with safety that melody was the chief attraction
to the people, and that harmony was either unknown or
little appreciated.
We should bear in mind that the most ancient recorded
octave scale of Greece and of Northern Asia and Africa is
the minor; but there may have been exceptional cases of
the use of the major, because the ancient Greeks had a five-

note major as well as a five-note minor scale in their
chromatic system. Nevertheless, it can have been but
little practised by them in early ages because it was never
admitted into their precepts. There is no Greek treatise
upon music which includes the major scale; and yet the
transition from one to the other was most easy, for who-
ever begins upon the third note, instead of the first, of any
minor scale, will transform it into its "relative" major.
These are the particular points to be borne in mind in
estimating remote dates for musical instruments.

And now to apply these principles to three of the
instruments of different races discovered in Central and

true parts of a major scale. They are such as a correct
musical ear would dictate, but they tell little as to the cul-
tivation of music.
Upon the same page (67) M. Engel passes on to the
Pitos (of the flageolet kind) used by the Aztecs. These
are of reddish pottery, having four finger-holes, and
producing five notes, including the open note of the
pipe
Several examples are in
the British Museum. Although Pitos vary in size they
have all the same pitch of sound, says M. Engel, and
are easy to blow. They have but five notes to the octave,
in the major scale, and this has been popularly called
"The Scotch Scale." M. Engel terms it pentatonic,
but, if it must needs have a Greek name, we prefer penta-
phonic, since two of the intervals for an octave scale are
of minor thirds. The points to be remarked in these
Pitos are that the "various lengths should have been so
proportioned as to be of the same pitch, and that the
scale should be major. We may say of the Aztecs, as of
the Chiriqui, that the practice of harmony did not obtain

among them, but the Aztecs had advanced further in the
direction of melody, and had in all probability a custom
of playing many pipes together in unison. They were
also advanced in the manufacture of pottery. It is often
convenient to suppose that a people is "indigenous," and
it may have been so for many centuries, but the specula-
tion for ethnologists is "Whence originally came the
Aztecs?"
The third case is of the Inca Peruvians
(p. 70). They had a Syrinx, or Pandean
pipe, which played in octaves. The seven
double pipes were of equal length, but
the one pipe was closed at the end, and
its fellow open. When M. Engel says:
"The reader is probably aware that the
closing of the pipe at the end raises its
pitch an octave," it is an error in writing
—he means that closing the end lowers
its pitch an octave. The Peruvian Syrinx
is pentaphonic in the key of C major.
The scale is printed as beginning with
the octaves of A, which we suspect to be
a misprint for B, and the reason will pre
sently appear.

viols had six strings, the Spaniards increased the number
upon their guitars to six, and termed them vihuelas, with-
out adopting the distinctive feature of the viol—the bow.
"No es otra cosa esta guitarra sino una vihuela quitada
la sexta y la prima cuerda," says Juan Bermudo, in 1555,—
"This guitar is no other than a vihuela deprived of its
first and sixth string"—but M. Engel has, by mistake,
given the name of vihuela to the earliest guitars with four
strings, as upon the portico of the church of Sant-Jago
di Compostella, and others. In England, in the sixteenth
century, the vihuelas were termed Spanish viols, and are
so named among the musical instruments left by Henry
VIII., but eventually they were reinstated in the name of
Spanish guitars, while the old English cittern, strung with
wire, and the number of strings increased from four to six
(single or double), was the guitar of the last century. M,
Engel has not recognised this change. The English
had also a small instrument with four catgut strings, very
like the four-stringed Spanish guitar called the gittern, or
ghittern. It differed chieily from the Spanish instrument
in having a lute-shaped back instead of a flat one. M.

Engel does not explain how this instrument differed from
the guitar, although he has given to another its Latinised
name, quinterna or guinterna.
Again, it is not in accordance with English usage to
term large pieces of bamboo partially split, in order that,
by shaking them, the sides may be rattled together,
"castanets ;" neither were castanets called crotata by the
ancients, as M. Engel suppose?. The ancient castanets
were made of nut-shells, cockles, oyster-shells, or small
pieces of metal, and were called krembala. "And beating
down the limpets from the rocks," fays Hermippus, "they
made a noise like castanets " (ic/jf/iffaAifbvo-i). The krotala
were maces and other large and loud rattles to be used in
the worship of Cybele. Sometimes the two parts were
detached and held in two hands, and sometimes they had
a hinge or spring at one end, to be sounded by closing
the hand suddenly so as to knock one against the
other. The stork was called crotalistria, from the noise
made by the bird in striking together the two bones of its
beak.
M. Engel's history is a little at fault when he writes
that " The earliest organs had only about a dozen pipe',"
and that " The largest, which were made about 900 years
ago, had only three octaves, in which the chromatic in-
tervals did not appear" (p. 108). This passage must be

contrast, the improvements which have been made in
Germany and other parts of the Continent of late years.
It can have no other meaning—for the organ at Winchester
had 400 pipes in the tenth and eleventh centuries. It is
fully described by a contemporary musician, the author
of a once celebrated, but now lost, treatise, De Tonorum

M. Engel makes also a mistake of from 400 to 500
years in the date of a manuscript, and, acting upon this
mistake, he claims priority for Germany over England
for the first use of the fiddle-bow. Strings have but a
fleeting tone, unless it be sustained by friction, and the
principle is so simple as to be intelligible at one glance,
and therefore to be readily adopted. But the first ex-

for the information of such should be couched in the
simplest language, and the sense conveyed should be at
once clear and comprehensive. In these respects Dr.
Procter's little work cannot be termed a success. To use
no stronger expression his language is frequently very
vague. For example, on page 14 the author in speaking
of " Chemical Affinity " says : "hence, in order that this
force may be exercised by the particles coming within
the sphere of each others' attraction, the substances must
be in the state of liquid or gas." There can be but one
way of understanding the latter part of this quotation,
viz., that no chemical action can take place, unless the
materials taking part in that action are each and all of
them in a liquid or gaseous state. Dr. Procter is scarcely
less happy in his definitions of bases, acids, &c. He
says: "An acid is a compound of an electro-negative
radical with hydrogen, which hydrogen it can ex-
change for a metal or basylous radical, and it is there-

f adopted, would introduce quite as serious, perhaps a mora
serious ambiguity. Gravity is an acceleration. When we say
that gravity is less in a balloon, or in a mine, than at the surface
of the earth, or greater at Glasgow than at Manchester, we are
speaking of alterations of g—the acceleration due to the earth's
attraction; and it would create confusion to employ this word to
designate forces also."
Now I do not think that the use of the word gravity as an
acceleration is at all common. On the contrary, I have looked
into all the books at my command and I cannot find any sup-
port whatever for such a use of the word. Every one is accus-
tomed to speak of the "force of gravity." To speak of the force
of an acceleration would be a complete anomaly.
All the dictionaries that I have seen support my view that
gravity means force, and does not mean acceleration. Take, for
example, a good modern book, the Imperial Dictionary. Tiiere
1 find—Gravity (Lat. graviias from gravis,heavy). I. Weight,
heaviness. 2. In philosophy—that force by which bodies tend
or are pressed, or drawn towards the centre of the earth—and so
on; showing that gravity always means force, though it has
various shades of meaning in its occasional applications.

Chambers' Encyclopedia says that the force which causes
bodies to fall towards the earth is termed gravity. The article
goes on to speak of the force of gravity at the earth, at various
heights above the earth, and at the moon. Acceleration is no-
where mentioned as a meaning of the word gravity.
Even if it could be shown that a few people have so far
departed from the original etymological sense and prevailing
use of the word gravity, as to employ it for an acceleration
instead of for a force, this would only prove that the ward is, to
that limited extent, subject to ambiguity at present. The course
that I advocaed was to avoid ambiguity by employing the word
gravity, used in its most common, and most authoritative sense,
instead of a thoroughly ambiguous word weight, in certain cases
where misapprehension from the use of the latter word is likely
to occur.
It seems to me that Mr. Stoney and Mr. Walker have been
led away by thinking of the letter g, rather than of the important
question at issue. The letter g stands for a number. One way
of specifying what number g stands for, is to say that it is the
numerical expression for the acceleration due to gravity, that is,
the acceleration due to the force of gravity acting on a falling
mass, But this is simply because,? is the number which repre-
sents the force in Gaussian units on unit mass, and because the
force of attraction on any body is proportional to the mass of the
body. The hitter is an experimentally discovered law. To say

Mr. Stoneyihat "gravity is an acceleration,"seemtomeexpressions
equally elliptic on the one hand, and, without full explanation,
misleading on the oilier.
If Mr. Stoney offers any method of getting rid of the ambiguity
better than that already introduced, others will gladly adopt it.
As to Mr. Walker's proposal to confine the_use of the word
"weight" to mean force, my former letter was partly for the
purpose of showing this to be impossible. The act of parlia-
ment, regulating weights and measures, settles that matter. Mr.
Stoney's letter forms, also, a sufficient answer to Mr. Walker's
proposal.

P.S.—Allow me to thank Mr. Barrett for his information as
to the earliest use of spring balances for kilodynes.
If Mr. Walker is serious in proposing to use vires for British
kinetic units of force, he ought to avoid centivires and millh'ires
for too vires and 1,000 vires respectively. These would be utterly
incompatible with the use of the prefixes cents, hekto and milli,

the epochs of maximum and minimum sun-spots.
It also appears as if the minimum had been reached again last
year, the mean oscillation (6'09) being less than in 1867. This
agrees with the conclusion derived by me from the Trevandrum
observations, and communicated to the French Academy of
Sciences last year. Dr. R. Wolf had previously (as I now
find l) concluded from his sun-spot observations that the mini-
mum would probably appear in 1S75 -6; and he considers we
have now one of the short periods, which his tables of sun-spots
show may be expected every 80-90 years. My own conclusion
to the same effect (that we have now a short period) was founded
on a consideration of the magnetic observations. The last short
period was that from the maximum 1829-7 (shown by Arago's
observations) to that of 1837-5 (shown by Gauss's observations),
an interval of rather less than eight years. If we may take
1875-5 as ,rie epoch of the present minimum, then the interval
from the last is nearly nine years. As the interval from the
minimum of Arago (1824-2) to the next was rearly 9-2 years, we
find a space of nearly forty-two years from the last short period
to this one. Should this hold for the next maximum it will

later measures of double-stars, amongst which is a con-
siderable number of well known binaries. The measures
are given in a slightly modified form from that adopted
in most of the Baron's previous important communi-
cations, which commenced in vol. 62 of the above
periodical.
For the sake of facilitating a comparison with the best-
determined orbits of revolving double-stars, we extract a
few of the most recent Gallarate epochs or means of the

and the baleen whales or Mysticetes, and none of the
known extinct forms present true transitional or interme-
diate characters; but it must be remembered that even
such remains as have been already collected have not
yet been thoroughly worked out. The Mysticetes appear,
at first sight, the most specialised and aberrant, in the
absence of teeth, in the presence of whalebone or baleen,
in the form and size of the mouth ; but as we see in other
groups, dental characters and all such as relate to the
prehension of food generally, are essentially adaptive,
and consequently plastic or prone to variation, and hence
cannot well be relied upon as tests of affinity. In
another character, also adaptive, the laxity of the con-
nection of the ribs with the vertebral column and with
the sternum, and the reduction of that bone in size,
allowing great freedom of expansion of the thoracic
cavity, for prolonged immersion beneath the water, the
Mysticetes have passed beyond the Odontocetes in spe-
cialisation. On the other hand, the great symmetry
of the skull, the more anterior position of the nares,
and their double external orifice, the form of the nasal

bones, the presence of a distinctly developed olfactory
organ, the mode of attachment of the periotic bone to the
cranium, the presence of a crccum. and the regular
arrangement of the alimentary canal, the more normal
characters of the manus and the better development of
the muscles attached to it, and the presence (in many
species at least) of parts representing a hind limb, all show
less deviation from the general mammalian type than is
presented by the Odontocetes. Taking all their struc-
tural characters into consideration, as well as what we
know of their past history, it does not appear that we can
consider either type to have been derived from the other,
nt all events in the form in which we see it now, but must
rather view them as parallel groups.
Among the Mysticetes, in the especially distinguishing
characters of the division, the Balanopiera are less
f pecialised than the Bahena, which in the greater size of
the head, the length and compression of the rostrum, i:._
development of the baleen, and the shortness of the cer-
vical region, are exaggerated types of the former, and yet
they retain more fully some primitive characters, as the
better development of the hind limb, the pentadactylous
manus, and the absence of a dorsal fin. Both forms are
found distinct in a fossil state as far back as the early
Pliocene, but generally represented by smaller species

than those now existing. The Mysticetes of the Miocene
seas were, as far as we know at present, only Balcrnoptera,
some of which {Cetolhcrium, Brandt) were, in the elongated
flattened form of the nasal bones, the greater distance
between the occipital and frontal bones at the top of the
head, and the greater length of the cervical vertebne
more generalised than those now existing. In the form
of the mandible they are considered by Van Beneden to
present more approximation to the Cetodonts.
Among the toothed whales, the earliest known form,
the Zeuglodon, was far the most aberrant, approach-
ing in the structure of its skull and teeth to a more gene-
ralised but very low carnivorous type. In smallness of
cerebral cavity, compared to the mouth and other parts
of the skull, it is as far below all other known cetaceans,
as the singular Arctocyon ptimcn'us is below all carni-
vores. One could quite imagine that the skull of a very
degraded seal would present many features in common
with Zeuglodon, and this is the only near link we seem to
possess between the Cetacea and the rest of the animal
world. All the resemblances which some naturalists have

A comparison of these figures with those usually given
in text-books to represent the distribution of heat in the
spectrum is a sufficient proof that the mechanical action
of radiation is as much a function of the luminous rays
as it is of the dark heat-rays.
The author discusses the question, '.' Is the effect due
to heat or to light?" There is no real difference between
heat and light; all we can take account of is difference of
wave-length; and a ray of a definite refrangibility cannot
be split up into two rays, one being heat and one light.
Take, for instance, a ray of definite refrangibility in the
red. Falling on a thermometer it shows the action of
heat, on a thermopile it produces an electric current, to
the eye it appears as light and colour, on a photographic
plate it causes chemical action, and on the suspended
pith it causes motion. But all these actions are insepa-
rable attributes of the ray of that particular wave-length,
and are not evidence of separate identities.
The author enters into some theoretical explanations of
the action of the different parts of the spectrum, but these
cannot well be given in abstract.
An experiment is described by which sunlight was fil-
tered through alum, glass, and water screens, so as to cut
off the whole of the ultra-red or dark-heat rays. The ray
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of light which was thus freed from dark heat was allowed
to fall on the pith surface of the torsion-apparatus, when
it produced a deflection of 1050. On interposing a solu-
tion of iodine in disulphide of carbon the deflection fell
to 2°, showing that the previous action was almost entirely
due to light. With a candle tried under the same circum-
stances, the light filtered from dark heat produced a
deflection of 370, which was reduced to 5° by interposing
the opaque solution of iodine.
In order to obtain comparative results among discs of
pith coated with lampblack and with other substances, a
torsion-apparatus was constructed in which two or more
discs could be exposed one after the other to a standard
light. One disc always being lampblacked pith, the other
discs could be changed so as to get comparisons of action.
If the action of radiation from a candle on the lamp-
blacked disc be taken as 100, the following are the pro-
portions obtained :—

of his balance is not excessive, and that in practice it will
safely indicate the millionth of a grain.
One observation of the weight of sunlight is given ; it
was taken on December 13; but the sun was so obscured
by thin clouds and haze that it was only equal to io'2
candles 6 inches off. Calculating from this datum, it
is seen that the pressure of sunshine is 2'3 tons per square
mile.
The author promises further observations with this in-
strument, not only in photometry and in the repulsion
caused by radiation, but in other branches of science in
which the possession of a balance of such incredible deli-
cacy is likely to furnish valuable results.
SCIENCE IN GERMANY
(From a German Correspondent!)
A FEW years ago Edlund attempted to decide the
question whether the galvanic current is capable of
directly altering the volume of a conductor through which
it flows, or not, i.e., whether changes of volume were
demonstrable that were independent of the heat produced
in the conducting wire? The results of his experiments
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
appeared to furnish an affirmative answer to this question.
More recently, Streintz published an investigation, the
result of which was a confirmation of Edlund s view on
the expanding power of the galvanic current. The ex-
panding action found by Edlund was from 2'8 to 65 per
cent, of the action of the heat simultaneously produced;
that found by Streintz was considerably greater. In soft
iron it amounted to 27 per cent, of the action of the heat.
From the fundamental importance which attaches to
this question, in relation to the theory of galvanism, and
from the difficulty of demonstrating the volume-changes
referred to, apart from the actions of the heat simulta-
neously produced, it was desirable that the subject should
be investigated by a method as free from error as pos-
sible. Such an investigation has lately been carried out
by Herr Exner, in Vienna. The essential points of his
method are as follows :—
Two pieces, a and b, of the same wire, about equally
long, were suspended vertically one over the other, as
indicated schematically in the figure. The lower piece,
b, passed centrally through a glass tube, c, which was
quite open above, but closed below with a cork, which
merely gave passage to the wire b by a short glass tube
(2mm. wide) inserted in it. From the lower end of the wire
b hung the plate d for holding weights. This was fur-

nished at its base with a sharp iron point, meant to act
on one arm of a lever which could be turned about e,
while the other arm bore the mirror / at right-angles to
its axis, and so in a vertical plane. If the image of a
vertical scale were observed in this mirror with a tele-
scope, I' 0 least change in length of the wires a and b
could tl.-eby be perceived. From the point of con-
nection between a and b a wire was connected with the
battery g. The other pole of the battery was connected
with the commutator /;, and thus the current could be sent
either through the rheostat i to the suspending point of the
wire a and through the latter back to the battery, or on the
other side to the mercury cup k, in which is dipped the
bent end of a short copper wire soldered to the plate, d,
establishing thus a conductive connection between the
commutator /; and the wire b. Through the latter the
current then went back to the battery. One could thus
easily send the current successively through each of the
two wire-pieces, a and b, separately, and so observe the
elongation experienced by each. Since, as has been
said, the two pieces a and b were not exactly equal in

Houses of Parliament last session by Her Majesty's com-
mand. Some further information upon the subject is
contained in the Ninth Annual Report of the Warden of
the Standards, recently published.
The following is a summary of the terms of the Conven-
tion/which bears date Paris, May 20, 1875.
By the two first Articles the high contracting parties
agree to found and maintain at their common expense an
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, scientific
and permanent, its seat to be at Paris. The French
Government will undertake to facilitate the acquisition,
or if requisite, the construction of a building to be spe-
cially appropriated for this purpose.
Article3 fixes the conditions under which the Interna-
tional Bureau will execute its functions. It is to be placed
under the exclusive direction and superintendence of an
International Committee of Weights and Measures, which
itself is to be under the authority of a General Conference
of Weights and Measures formed of delegates from all
the contracting Governments.

The President for the time being of the Academy of
Sciences at Paris is to be the President of the General
Conference of Weights and Measures. But this body
will not be called into existence until the verification of
all the new standards shall have been completed, when it
will be convoked for the purposes of sanctioning them
and their distribution. All the Governments who send
delegates to the International Metric Commission will be
entitled to be represented at the General Conference.
Articles 5 and 6 relate to the organisation of the Inter-
national Bureau, the International Committee, and the
Conference General. The duties of the International
Bureau are specified as follows :—The verification and
conservation of the new metric prototypes of the metre
and kilogramme, the construction of which has been en-
trusted to the French Section of the International Metric
Commission ; the verification of all the copies of these
prototypes and their periodical comparisons; the verifi-
cation and comparison of geodesical measuring instru-
ments ; and the comparison and verification of standards
and scales of precision.
Articles 7, 9, and 10 fix the establishment of the Inter-
national Bureau and the mode of defraying the expenses
by contributions from all the contracting governments,
according to a scale based on the respective amounts of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
their actual population.
These expenses are limited by Articles 5 and 6 of the
Regulations annexed to the Convention to the total
amount of 400,000 francs (16,000/.) for establishing the
Bureau and providing it with all the requisite instru-
ments, together with an annual sum not exceeding
ioo.oco francs (4,000/.) for the current expenditure, re-
ducible to 50,000 francs (2,000/.), after the completion
and distribution of the new national metric standards.
Articles II, 12, 13 of the Convention reserve the right
to every other civilised state to take part in it, under
specified conditions ; and enable the contracting parties
by common agreement to make all such modifications in
the terms of the Convention as may be found by expe-
rience useful; they also allow any of the contracting
parties to withdraw from the Convention at the expiration
of a term of twelve years.
A series of Regulations are annexed to the Convention,
which fix the details of the organisation of the Interna-
tional Bureau, and of the composition and functions of
the International Metric Committee and of the General

not yet been able to obtain the sanction of their Legisla-
tures for the ratification of the Convention, and they
requested further time for this purpose. The Argentine
Republic and Venezuela also requested further time, and
the requests were granted. Brazil alone declined to ratify
the Convention and take part in its objects.
Before the adjournment of the late French National
Assembly, they passed a law which was introduced by the
French Government to grant the Pavilion Breteuil at St.
Cloud, with some adjoining land, to the directors of the
International Bureau for the purposes of this scientific
institution, so long as it shall continue in existence.
The following appear to be the approximate proportions
which the several contracting States will have to contribute
towards the expenses of the new International Metric
Bureau, based on Article 20 of the Regulations, by which
the unit of contribution is to be determined from the
population of each State, expressed in millions, and mul-
tiplied by the coefficient 3 for those countries where the
metric system is adopted compulsorily; by 2 where it is
adopted permissively; and by 1 for other countries.

satisfied with one's work, however, is one thing; how to
make it better is quite another. In chemistry we have
perhaps all the means commonly employed. In physio-
logy we can get objective illustrations brought into the
class-room, and can use the microscope and diagrams.
In mechanics our workshops supply practical work, but
for the class-room we have only the most homely practical
examples, and I know of no apparatus that is not cum-
brous, needlessly costly, or ineffectual. Johnstone's ad-
mirable illustrations and the black-board arc our chief
agents. I would travel far to get a practical knowledge
of means and methods by which we could improve our
own.
I believe that such knowledge as I have indicated may-
be profitably given even to very young boys. They leam
thereby to distinguish the precise features and qualities
of natural objects, and the conditions of ordinary phe-
nomena ; and such teaching undoubtedly exercises in the
best way the' observing powers which develop much
earlier than the reflective faculty. I am inclined to say
that teaching elementary science to boys from ten to

thirteen is a greater success than teaching grammar, i.e.,
that the principles involved are more easily seen, excite
mire interest, and become therefore a better mental dis-
cipline. We rarely have boys come to us with any know-
ledge of science, and when they have, it has generally
been acquired from lectures, and is worthless as a means
of education. We do not lecture, but do real hard class-
work, and take periodical examinations on this work,
giving it equal value in these and our grade examinations
with language and mathematics. We have no reason to
believe that this work interferes with or deteriorates the
work in language and mathematics, in which subjects we
find our boys quite equal, and, except in very rare cases,
I may say, superior to incomers of like power, and who
have had no science teaching.
The great number of men eminent for their vast scicn-
tifi: attainments, who have achieved this eminence in
spite of our non-scientific, I may almost say anti-scien-
tific, system of education, clearly indicates that many of
us have an inherent scientific power or genius surpassing
our power in any other direction. I plead for such that
they have the same chance of being floated on their
scientific voyage as the linguist and the mathematician
have on theirs : and I have seen no satisfactory pica why
they should not. Value for value I claim for the science

man a higher status in our present social life than is due
to either linguist or mathematician.
My experience as a schoolmaster has revealed to me
many cases where the talent for language or mathematics
has been so low that the education effected by these has
been of the meanest kind; or where the incessant failure
has produced a stolid ignorance, a kind of mental paraly-
sis, most disheartening to all concerned. Such cases
have come into my hands, and I have seen intelligence
rekindled, and mental power aroused by simple science
teaching, and the power even for other subjects enhanced
thereby. I plead for these feeble ones. Is it not a crime
to them to keep the mind fixed on what to them is ab-
struse and unintelligible, and to shut against them the
inspiring book of nature, which may contain the only in-
tellectual sunshine of which their being is susceptible?

A discovery of great importance to prehistoric archeology
has just been made in France. On March 2, while some work-
men were excavating in a quarry of Jurassic limestone, near
the little commune of Cravanche, about three kilometres N. W.
of Belfort, at the base of a hillock, they came upon a small open-
ing which was found to lead into a cave of large dimensions. On
entering the cavern its floor was found to be covered with human
bones, so disposed as to lead to the belief that the cave formed a
prehistoric place of sepult ire. Magnificent stalagmitic columns
rise from the floor, but without corresponding stalactites. It
would seem as if these columns were partly natural and partly
artificial, as they appear to be disposed in a sort of systematic
method, after the form of dolmens. It is in these cavities that
the multitude of bones have been found. The skulls are raised
slightly above the level of the rest of the bodies, which appear
to be in a somewhat bent position. Several polished Hint
weapons have also been found, three beautiful ornamented
vases in the form of urns, polished stone bracelets, and a
mat of plaited rushes. The cave itself is calculated to be about
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
36 metres long and about 12 in breadth and height ; and numerous
galleries, or side-cavems, run off the main one. Immediately on
the discovery of the cavern, the authorities of Belfort took
measures to guard it and the treasures it contains in the interests
of science, and M. Felix Voulot, who has given great attention
to the subject of prehistoric archeology, has been charged wilh
carrying on the researches. M. Voulot hopes to be able to dis-
engage from the stalagmitic covering at least one entire skeleton.
There is no doubt that we have here important remains of the
polished stone period, but it is confidently expected that further
research will bring to light relics of a much older period ; indeed
the writer in the Revue Scicntifujuc, of April I, from which the
above details arc taken, hopes that remains will be found not only
belonging to the Tertiary, but even to the Cretaceous period.
The cavern is situated in a bed of one of the lower strata of the
Jurassic period (lower oolite), "on the exact limit of the shoreof
the ancient Jurassic sea."

Royal Society, March 23.—"Description of a Mammalian
Ovum in an early condition of Development," by E. A. Schafer,
Assist. Prof, of Physiology in Univ. College.
The author describes the ovum of the cat from five, in the
stage where they were rendered evident as scarcely perceptible
swellings in the cornua uteri. In their long axes they were f inch
long; in their short, ,'T inch. No mesoblast was anywhere
present between the hypo- and epiblastic layers, which latter were
clearly separable from one another and nearly in contact only in
a small part, where only the cells of each were in more than
single layers. At this spot also, the cellular elements of each
layer being perfectly recognisable, an exquisitely fine pellicle,
which in section appears as a mere line, passes over and forms
a definite boundary to the outer surface of the hypoblast at the
thickened area. This is named the mimirana limitans hypo-
blastica, and is found to be perfectly homogeneous and con-
tinuous, becoming stained slightly with carmine, and is probably
a cuticular formation produced by the underlying cells. This
structure seems to have been as yet unnoticed ; the mesoblast
cells without doubt first appear outside it, which is in favour of
the epiblastic origin of that layer.

Communicated by 15. Stewart, F.R.S., Professor of Natural
Philosophy in Owens College, Manchester.
Mr. Crookes has lately drawn attention to the mechanical
action of a source of light on delicately suspended bodies in
vacuo : I have made a few experiments with the view of finding
out the seat of the reaction which evidently must tend to move
either the enclosure or the source of light. I have found that
the action and reaction is entirely between the hght bodies sus-
pended in vacuo and the exhausted vessel.
Mr. Crookes' "Light-Mill" was suspended by means of two
cocoon fibres, forming a bifilar suspension from the top of a
vessel which could be exhausted. A slight movement of the
enclosure could be easily detected by means of a concave minor
attached to it. A beam of the oxyhydrogen lamp was concen-
trated on the light-mill, which then revolved about 200 times a
minute.
The light was cut off at the beginning of the experiment by
means of a screen, and the position of rest of the glass vessel was
read off by means of the dot of light on the scale. The screen
was then suddenly removed, and in every case a large deflection
of the glass vessel was observed. The vessel was deflected in

Mr. Darwin points out. Hildebran l's and Hanstein's explana-
tions of the torsion he thinks inadequate. Darwin's observations
prove it resides in the individual awn-cells. When isolated and
dried these latter twist on their own axis, similarly in direction,
Sec, to the awn and with moisture untwist. Finally, this re-
markable power is shown to depend on the molecular structure
of the twisting cell-walls. Niigeli and others' researches into
twisting cells have not led hitherto to their importance in plant
life.—The Secretary briefly referred to a technical paper by the
Rev. J. M. Crorabie, "On the Lichens of Antarctic America

H.M.S. Nassau, 1867-9." In this ninety-seven species and
varieties are recorded : twenty-four of these and a genus, Endo-
cena, are attributed to be new.—A discussion on the potato
fungus followed. At the President's request Mr. Carruthers
reiterated the salient features of Prof, dc Bary's recent investiga-
tions. He called attention to the difference in thickness of the
mycelial threads carrying oospores and antheridia, to the septate
character of the threads, and to other points collectively adverse

to Mr. W. Smith's views of the " resting spore " of Peronospora;
De Bary believing two fungi have been confounded. The Rev.
M. Berkeley defended Mr. Smith's conclusions as opposed to
De Bary's, asserting that as the former, by photographs
and drawings from nature, had shown the sexual congress of
antheridium and oogonium derived from the unequal sized
spawn-threads, no reasonable doubt of their connection existed.
Admitting De Bary's extensive knowledge of fungi, Mr.
Berkeley, nevertheless, objected to his style of criticism. Mr.
Smith himself read a long written reply answering De Bary's
objections in detail. He averred that Sadebeck's recent obser-
vations supported his own as to two sizes of mycelial threads,
and the other objections raised with regard to the o>gonia and
antheridia. As to septal character of the threads, this belongs to
Peronospora, those ol Pythium being destitute in this respect. He
further alluded to the warty bodies of Montagne's Artotrogus,
showing De Bary had misconceived their nature. The Stras-
bourg professor's animadversion on the life-history of Smith's
"resting-spore" being yet incomplete is weakened when the
former admits it may take a year to resolve, and as yet only nine
months have elapsed since the discovery of the bodies in ques-
tion. Other remarks pertaining to the "resting spores " being
found in dry leaves, after decay in water, and on perennial my-
celium were made, Mr. Smith concluding that De Bary had not
entirely comprehended his publications on the subject. Mr. Renny
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
expressed his opinion that the points were not absoutely settled
on either side, discrepancies still appearing to him to exist. De
Bary's objections were allowable on the ground of his extensive
acquaintance with the subject, while possibly Smith may not have
given the exact value to whit he saw. Mr. T. Dyer suggested
that the bodies of the so-called Artotrogus may be but mycelial
dilatations, and not true oogonia ; on this ground a fresh investi-
gation might be necessary to ascertain its relations to the ques-
tions at issue. Mr. A. Murray, Mr. Cooke, and Dr. Master5
each made a few remarks. Mr. Carruthers, in conclusion,
thought Mr. Rinny had put the case fairly. De Bary only meant
to question Smith's knowledge of the conidia, not that he was
ignorant of the potato fungus; he, De Bary, may have misunder-
stood Smith's drawings, but in the elucidation of facts and truths
he certainly could not fairly be accused of hypercriticism, seeing
that he himself had carelully watched and studied the develop-
ment, mode of hosts, &c, since 1874.

necessary either that the wires shall not touch each other, or that
if they do, no flow shall pass across the junction. This rule is
often overlooked, and the oversight has given rise in certain
cases to a notion of electrical "interference." The concluding
part of the paper has to do with the flow conditions when
fine poles are combined with point poles in a sheet, espe-
cially when point electrodes are introduced into a sheet when
a uniform current or "river" is flowing across the sheet.—Dr.
Guthrie then communicated a fourth paper on salt solutions and
attached water. It consists mainly of an account of an examina-
tion of the behaviour of a salt solution, when cooled below the
freezing point of water. Having shown in previous communica-
tions that every salt solution, when of a certain strength solidifies
as a whole, at a certain temperature as a cryohydrate, the present
research was directed to the determination of the temperatures
at which, (1) ice separates fro.n solutions of strengths weaker
than the cryohydrate, and (2), the anhydrous salt or some
hydrate richer than the cryohydrate, separates from solutions
stronger than the cryohydrate. About twenty typical salts have
been examined in this manner, and carves were exhibited in
which the abscissa1 represent strengths, and the ordinates solidifi-

cation temperatures. All the curves have a similar character
and exhibit a point of contrary flexure, between the origin repre-
senting pure water at o" C. and the cryohydrate. Between the
cryohydrate and the o" C. degree of saturation, they are nearly
straight lines, and a-e continuous with the curves of solubility
above o" C. The joint effect of two salts in depressing the
temperature of ice-formation was also examined. From previous
experiments the general law that the temperature of a freezing
mixture is identical with that of the solidification of the cryohy-
drate of the corresponding salt, appeared not to be the case
willi iodide ol sodium. It now appears that this salt offers no
exception to the general law and that what was previously mis-
taken forthe cryohydrate is really a sub-cryohydratesolidifying at a
higher temperature. Certain remarkable cases of supersaturation
were discussed which show that a solution may be supersaturated
in a 3-fold manner, (1) with regard to ice (2) with regard to a
salt, and (3) with regard to the cryohydrate of the salt. The
parallelism between a boiling saturated salt solution and a
glaciating one wa> pointed out.

A RESEARCH FUND FOR THE CHEMICAL
SOCIETY
AN offer has lately been made to the Chemical Society,
which has for its object the establishing of a fund
to be applied in aiding the development of scientific
chemistry. The offer comes from Dr. Longstaff, who
proposes giving the society the sum of 1,000/., on condi-
tion that at least an equal amount be raised and in-
vested together with his gift, in approved security. To
make this offer known to the Fellows of the Chemical

Dear Sir,
I am instructed by the President and Council of the
Chemical Society, to request your consideration of a matter,
which they hope will tlicit your interest and active co-operation.
Tlie advancement of Chemical Science, which constitutes the
special object of the Chemical Society, may be promoted chiefly

in two ways :—
1. By facilitating the early acquirement by students of
Chemistry of a knowledge of the results of chemical research
carried on in this and other countries.
2. By affording direct assistance to workers in chemical
science, with a view to encourage and facilitate their labours in
experimental research.
The Chemical Society has sought from the time of its founda-
tion to aid iu the first of these objects by the publication of
original papers communicated to the Society; and, during the
last five years, a special guarantee fund and liberal aid from the
British Association for the Advancement of Science have
enabled the Society to establish, on a firm footing, the publica-
tion of monthly abstracts of original papers published in this
country and abroad, on chemistry and allied brandies of science.
The Chemical Society has also recently endeavoured, as far
as its funds would permit, to afford assistance to chemists
undertaking original investigations, by the extension of its
library, and occasionally by grants of small sums of money,
when pecuniary aid was applied for. The limited resources of
the society have, however, restricted the number and amount of
these grants within very narrow limits. In 1872, Mr. T. Hyde
Hills placed at the disposal of the Chemical Society the sum of
10/. as the nucleus of a fund for promoting original research;
and offered under certain conditions, made with the object of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
securing the co-operation of others, to contribute a like sum
annually. This attempt of Mr. Hills to form a research fund
was not, at the time, seconded. The Council have, however,
recently received from Dr. G. D. Longstaff, one of the original
members, the generous offer to place at the disposal of the
society, the sum of one thousand pounds (1,000/.) towards esta-
blishing a permanent fund for promoting the advancement of
Chemical Science, on the condition that not less than an equal
amount be subscribed for the same purpose.
As the President and Council (eel that such a fund would add
much to the usefulness of their Society, and enable them to
encourage still further the prosecution of Chemical Science, they
are most desirous to secure to the Society the benefit of this
munificent offer of Dr. Longstaff; and have therefore instructed
me to ask your cooperation towards the attainment of this
object. I remain, Yours obediently,
William J. Russell, Treasurer.
Considering the use to be made of this fund, and the
very large number of persons interested either in the
scientific development of chemistry, or else in its many
lucrative applications, it is not unreasonable to expect

men—who wished to obtain in this way a notion of the
chief advances made in Natural Philosophy since their
student days. The demand, therefore, which these lec-
tures are intended to meet, is that of men who, though
they have received a liberal education, in which the ele-
ment of science has not been neglected, are too deeply
engaged in their professional work to keep themselves
abreast of contemporary science by regular study, but
who are yet able to avoid falling behind by occasionally
availing themselves of an hour with a scientific friend.
In lectures of this kind, therefore, we are not to look
for the elaborate exposition and reiterated inculcation by
which the facts and methods of science are impressed
upon the minds of beginners. Still less are we to expect
the forcible language and striking illustrations by which
those who are past hope of being even beginners may be
prevented from becoming conscious of intellectual ex-
haustion before the hour has elapsed. We are rather to
listen to one who has climbed high on the hard and slip-
pery peaks of science as he points out the grand features
of the prospect to those who stand on a lower level but

yet on the same solid foundation with himself.
In his own words he has "to point out a few of the
principal peaks which we have to ascend, and of the more
formidable abysses which we have to avoid."
As safety must come before success, it may be well to
observe that the most formidable of all these abysses is
that of a priori physics. The study of this branch of
science as it is to be found in the works of Hegel, Her-
bart, and others, seems to furnish an unfailing source
of recreation to those who are engaged in the less
amusing researches of experimental physics. In our
modern examinations those candidates who try to
conceal their ignorance by sending up what appears
to them to be the most plausible answer to a ques-
tion, often help to relieve by their felicitous absurdities
the tedious labours of the examiner. We have only to
imagine that instead of the weary examiner we have the
vigorous man of science, and instead of the timorous
candidate, some great philosopher before whose inner
vision the whole world of being and not-being, in its
apparent contradiction and fundamental indifference, lies
open ; and we shall then have some faint idea of the
mode in which the writings of these philosophers may be
destined to contribute to the merriment, if not to the
happiness of the coming race.

We are glad to find, however, that in spite of the con-
tempt which Prof. Tait pours upon the d priori physics
of non-experimental philosophers, he admits that there
is a true science of metaphysics which discusses the
fundamental ideas of all science and knowledge, not by
shutting out all the facts of experience, but by calling in
all the evidence obtainable from the whole circle of the
science.
In fact one of the greatest benefits which the advance
of science has conferred on the world at large is that
words and phrases have been gradually introduced into
ordinary language which are consistent with true scien-
tific ideas, and that these have displaced words and
phrases which implied false ideas about nature, so that
each generation, as it leains its mother tongue, finds it
better adapted to express what really exists, and less
suggestive of what is not.
We have only to read the expositions of science in the
seventeenth century to see that they are addressed to
students whose minds were imbued with prejudices and
superstitions which are now known only to archzeologists.

with respect to the nature of comets and the origin of
their light. He considers these bodies as consisting of
swarms of distinct meteorites, which are illuminated partly
by the light of the sun, but which also give out a light of
their own arising from the numerous and violent collisions
which are always taking place, especially near the nucleus
where the swarm is densest. The most remarkable fact
about this light is that discovered by Huggins, namely,
that its spectrum is identical with that of a hydrocarbon.
We are sorry, however, not to find in this volume any ex-
position of that theory of Prof. Tait's concerning the deve-
lopment and manifestation of the tails of comets to which
Sir W. Thomson referred in his presidential address to the
British Association in 1871 as "Tait's beautiful sea-bird
analogy." A " tactic arrangement" of brickbats extending
over millions of miles would perhaps account for what at
present appears from a dynamical point of view most
paradoxical in the behaviour of comets' tails, but the
dynamical explanation of this tactic arrangement itself
seems still to remain as a desideratum of the theory.

DR. BALL ON SCREWS
The Theory of Screws j a Study in the Dynamics of a
Rigid Body. By R. S. Ball, LL.D., F.R.S., Andrews'
Professor of Astronomy in the University of Dublin
and Royal Astronomer of Ireland. (Dublin: Hodges,
Foster, and Co., 1876.)
DR. BALL has published several papers of late years
on the subject here treated. The present volume
contains the substance of these papers re-cast, with addi-
tional matter, and with a greatly improved terminology.
It has been shown by the combined labours of Poinsot,
Chasles, and Mobius, that there is a perfect mathe-
matical identity between the composition of forces and
couples on the one hand, and of rotations and transla-
tions on the other. Every small movement of a rigid
body consists of rotation round a definite line combined
with sliding along it, in other words, consists of a twist on
a definite screw, and every system of forces applied to a
rigid body is reducible to a force along a definite line,
together with a couple round it. The force is the
analogue of the rotation, the couple is the analogue of
the translation, and the combined action of the force and
couple is called by Dr. Ball a wrench on a screw. In
each rase the screw consists of the definite line (fixed in
position but unlimited in length), associated with a
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
definite length, called the pitch, namely, the quotient
of the translation by the rotation, or of the couple
by the force. The amplitude of a twist is the mag-
nitude of the rotation; the intensity of a wrench is
the magnitude of the force. A twist, or its analogue a
wrench, is defined by six numbers, one of which may be
the amplitude or intensity, and the other five will then be
common to all twists and wrenches on the same screw.
A screw is therefore defined by five numbers.
When a body twists while acted on by a wrench, the
work done by the latter is the continued product of the
amplitude of the twist, the intensity of the wrench, and a
thiid factor called the viitual co-efficient of the two
screws. The virtual co-efficient is a symmetrical func-
tion of the two screws, and when it vanishes the two
screws are called reciprocal. In other words two screws
are said to be reciprocal if a wrench on one of them does
no work in virtue of a twist on the other.
Taking six screws at random in space, we can express
any twist as the resultant of six twists, one on each of
these screws, and the amplitudes of the six components are

NATURE
We have said enough to indicate the richness of the
ground which Dr. Ball has broken, and we would com-
mend his treatise to the careful attention of mathema-
ticians.
We could wish that a sharper line had been drawn
between real and imaginary solutions, and also between
results that are only true for screws of finite pitch and
those that are true without this restriction. We also
think that the convention which Dr. Ball proposes (foot-
note, p. 11) for removing ambiguity from the expression
for the virtual coefficient, is defective, partly because he
has overlooked the fact that the virtual coefficient of two
screws is essentially signless until positive as distin-
guished from negative directions have been arbitrarily
selected along them. When this selection has been
made, the virtual coefficient is the value of the quater-
nion expression - pSafj -f- Sa^y, where p denotes the
algebraical sum of the pitches, a and /3 unit-vectors
parallel to the two selected positive directions, and y
the vector perpendicular from the screw a to the screw /3.

ternions would require such a long specification as would
weary the patience of our readers.
The value of Dr. Ball's book is enhanced by an appen-
dix containing a very clear and interesting n'sume of the
Literature of the subject, from Poinsot downwards. We
may supplement this list by a reference to §§ 200, 201 of
Thomson and Tait's " Treatise on Natural Philosophy,"
where one degree of constraint is shown to be reducible
to the condition that "every longitudinal motion of a
certain axis must be accompanied by a definite propor-
tion of rotation about it." This comes very near to the
indication of the one reciprocal screw by which such
constraint may be defined. J. D. E.

Colour of Flowers Grown in the Dark
In Nature, vol. xiii. p. 348, Mr. Thiselton Dyer gives an
extract from Sachs's "Text-book of Botany" to the effect that
no change is produced in the colour of flowers by growing them
in the dark. This led to a letter from Mr. J. C. Costerus
(vol. xiii. p. 427), calling attention to the results obtained
by Askenasy, published in 1876, who found that some kinds
were changed in colour, and some not changed. In the
autumn of 1873 I made a number of experiments on this subject,
and published a short account of them in the same year in the
Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. iii. p. 474. I came to the
same conclusion as Askenasy has come to, and was also able to

establish some important generalisations. I will only mention a
few special instances. I was unable to cause any change in the
colour of the common Orange Lily (Lilium auranliacum),
whereas I found that a very considerable change was produced
in the case of Erysimum Peroffikianum by only a moderate
degree of darkness. This may perhaps be owing to the fact
that the orange tint of these two kinds of flowers is due to entirely
different substances. That of the lily is due to what I have called
orange xanthophyll, whereas that of the other flower is due to
a much less stable compound, giving an entirely different spec-
trum, met with also in the orange marigold, and therefore
named by me Calendula xanthine. Comparing together the
mixed colouring matters found in an equal weight of the petals,
I found that the amount of the Calendula xanthine was only
liaif as great in the petals grown in the dark, whereas the more
K yellow constituents were reduced only to three-quarters, so that
the general colour was more yellow. I found that a similar
change could be produced in the case of the marigold. If
shaded when the flowers are somewhat grown, the total colour
may be very considerably reduced without there being any
material change in the ratios of the different colouring matters,

C. G. S. system of units has been introduced into the course of
Mechanics in this College, I may be permitted to say that the
system actually employed is not that referred to by your cor-
respondent. I generally employ the kilogramme, metre, and
second, and sometimes the foot, pound, and second, to measure
3 dynam or unit of force. The dynamometers alluded to as about
to be exhibited at the Loan Exhibition of Scientific Instruments
at South Kensington are suitable to the former system, and I
use them for the measurement of dynams in kilogrammetres.
One of these dynamometers is graduated for every 200 grammes
up to 100 kilogrammes, the other for every 100 grammes up to
10 kilogrammes, and they cannot be depended on for results
within the tenth of a kilogramme. Spring dynamometers, though
suitable for the large units employed in mechanics, are totally
unfit for measuring units on the C. G-. S. system. I concur with
Prof. Everett, in his book on this system, when he says :—" A
spring balance, it is true, gives a direct measurement of force,
but its indications are too rough for purposes of accuracy " (p. S).
Spring dynamometers are therefore unsuited to a system where
the units are measured by ?jT of a gramme, or about CV of a
grain, as in the C. G. S. system. Henry Hennessy

Dr. Andrews has shown by his experimental researches on
carbonic acid, that at a temperature above 31° C. or 88" F. the
difference between the gaseous and the liquid states no longer
exists. I quote the following brief statement from an admirable
paper on the subject, by Prof. James Thomson, in the "Pro-
ceedings of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical So-
ciety," 1872 ;—he is speaking of the case in which a given quantity
of carbonic acid, of which part is in the gaseous and part in the
liquid state, is kept at constant volume, while the temperature,
and consequently the pressure, are gradually increased :—
"As the temperature and pressure are augmented, the gaseous
part is always increasing in density, and the liquid part is dimi-
nishing in density, till at last the two come to have the same
densiiy with one another, and then they are perfectly alike in
every respect, all distinction between them having vanished. At
this stage the ttmperature is 310 C, and the pressure is about
seventy-five atmospheres. Above this temperature of 31° no
change of pressure can cause gasification or liquefaction ; and
above this pressure of about seventy-five atmospheres, no change
of temperature can cause gasification or liquefaction."

Olbers' Supposed Variable Star near 53 Vir-
gin is.—The only comet detected in the year 1796 was
found by Olbers in Virgo on the night of March 31. On
the following evening, at 8h. 55m., apparent time at
Bremen, it was over a star of the seventh magnitude
south—following 53 Virginis, and the light of the star
was remarked to be little affected by the intervention of
the comet. On March 1, 1797, desiring to fix more
exactly the place of this star, Olbers found in its position
one of only the tenth or eleventh magnitude, whereas in
April previous, according to Schroeter, who appears to
have compared the comet with it early on the morning of
April 2, it was the brightest star in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of 53 Virginis, and hence in Olbers' judgment
"a seventh magnitude at least." Writing to Bode in
March 1797 he directs attention to this star, as perhaps a
more remarkable variable star than even x Cygni. The
circumstances preclude suspicion of a similar phenomenon
to that described by Piazzi when the great comet of 1811
passed over his star XX. 197.
From the positions of the supposed variable, and its
neighbours given by Olbers (who also appends a diagram),
it is evident that his star, which followed 53 Virginis
30' 55'' in R.A., 20" 45" to the south, is No. 12,728 of

If we had specimens of all known forms of crocodiles,
recent and extinct, and set to work to classify them
according to their degrees of likeness and unlikeness, we
should find that they naturally fell into three series.
In the first of these it would be found that the skull
had all the characters mentioned at the end of the last
lecture, the posterior nares being small apertures opening
into the cavity of the mouth behind the pterygoid bones;
the vertebrae would be concave in front and convex be-
hind; the two bones composing the shoulder-girdle, the
shoulder-blade or scapula and the coracoid, would be
similar in shape, both being long and narrow; in the hip-
girdle, the haunch-bone or ilium would be much cut away
in front and excavated below, the ischium and pubis
being both long blade-like bones; and there would be
seven or eight longitudinal rows of bony plates on the back.
In the second set we should find the posterior nares to
be much larger and placed farther forwards, immediately
behind the palatine bones, the pterygoids not uniting as
in the first group. The vertebrae would be slightly hollowed
out at each end. In the shoulder and hip girdles there
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
would be no important difference from the first group, with
which also the more minute structure of the limbs would
correspond closely. A difference would, however, be
found in the fact of there being not more than two rows of
plates on the back.
In the third series, we should notice certain very
striking changes. The posterior nares would be actually
as far forward as in a lizard ; neither the palatine nor the
pterygoids uniting in the floor of the mouth ; the vertebra
would be completely amphictelous or biconcave; the
coracoid no longer long and narrow, but expanded and
rounded like that of a lizard ; the ilium more elongated
and without the notch on its lower edge; and the ischium
considerably broadened. As in the preceding group, the
rows of bony plates on the back would not exceed two.
Thus we should find that the second group held an
exactly intermediate place between the first and third, and
that the third ser, in every respect in which it differed
from the normal crocodilian structure, approached to that
of lizards.
It is a very interesting point to see how these three
groups appear in time. We should find that in the first
are included all the Recent and Tertiary forms, and that
there are no indications of the type below the later
Cretac ous.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
The second group would be found to extend from the
older Cretaceous down to the Lias ; moreover, a careful
examination would show that there were lesser modifica-
tions among the individual species of a very instructive
nature; those from the Wealden, for instance, would be
seen to have the posterior nares farther back (i.e., nearer
the typical crocodilian position) than those of the middle
Mesozoic, and these again than those of the Lias.
The third group would contain exclusively Triassic
forms, such as the dragon-like Beloaon and the St,igono-
lepis of the Elgin sandstones. In this latter formation the
fossils are in a very curious condition; after the sand
accumulated "round the bodies of the Triasssic animals
had hardened, water, percolating through the porous rock,
completely dissolved out the bones, leaving nothing but
cavities. Thus we have only the remains of remains to
deal with, but casts taken from the cavities enable us to
make out, with perfect certainty, even important cha-
racters, although there may be hardly a bone left.
We see then, that our third set of forms is the oldest,our
first the youngest, and the study of crocodilian remains

ON SAFETY MATCHES
THE fact has been known during some years past that
the so-called safety matches, which are warranted to
ignite " only on the box," can be fired by being rubbed
on glass, and as Mr. Preece recently pointed out (Nature,
vol. xiii. p. 208), on ebonite. I find that they can be ignited
by friction against ivory (I used an ivory paper-knife), steel
(a steel spatula, somewhat worn), zinc, copper, marble with
the polish worn off, and a freshly-cleaved surface of slate.
The match (or two matches together, for the sake of
strength) should be held near the tipped end, and then
be rubbed with strong friction, and with a long sweep upon
the solid surface. From two to twelve such sweeps may
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
be required before the match ignites, and the result seems
to be due to the conversion of mechanical work into heat
sufficient to fire the paste at the end of the match, which,
I suppose, consists mainly of potassic chlorate and sul-
phide of antimony.
After a few rubs the match begins to crackle, and then
suddenly bursts into flame. A similar result may be
obtained by grinding the chlorate in a mortar with a
little sulphur or sulphide.
The readiness with which the match ignites by friction
depends greatly on the nature of the surface. Lead is
too soft, and tin too smooth. The metals produced by
rolling have a sort of skin on the surface, over which the
match glides without sufficient friction, but if the surface
of zinc be rubbed with sand-paper or with a fine file, it
becomes active in firing the match. I noticed that the
polish of my ivory paper-knife became worn before it
acted well. Nor is it very easy to fire the match on glass.
A long sweep repeated about a dozen times with con-
siderable pressure seems to be necessary. The two
specimens of sheet copper used by me have a sort of
grain which is favourable to the success of the experi-
ment. The copper acted equally well whether the surface
was dirty or cleaned with dilute sulphuric acid. After

effect, the same match rubbed on copper immediately
took fire.
In the case of slate, lead, tin, and some other surfaces,
the composition on the match acts as a polish, and thus
renders it unfit for ignition. On the other hand, a finely-
cut file removes the composition from the end of the
match without igniting it.
I have no doubt that many other surfaces might be
found on which the safety matches would ignite with
greater or less difficulty. Notwithstanding this, the match
is still a safety match, although it does not comply with
the conditions asserted twice over on the box. It does
not ignite readily on any of the surfaces pointed out except
copper and marble, but it does ignite with wonderful
facility when rubbed against the side of the box, an
invention so ingenious that a few words of its history
may not be out of place here.

Since I am on the subject of Siberia, I may mention
two facts of considerable interest which I learnt last year.
I was told by inhabitants of Jenesseisk that in the re-
gions to the north of that town the compass is of no use
during an auroral display. It is not at all unlikely that
this should be the case in a country where auroral effects
are intense, and the horizontal component of the earth's
magnetism is small. The other interesting fact is that
Mr. Muller had reached Gauss' Siberian magnetic pole,
where he found the needle vertical. This was shortly
before I reached Irkutsk. His observations were to be
published in the Proceedings of the Siberian Geographi-
cal Society. I do not know whether a translation has
been published. George Forbes

THE DUBLIN SOCIETIES
WE have recently referred in several articles to the
efforts which are being made to introduce a more
satisfactory organisation among the various scientific
institutions in Dublin, which have hitherto been inde-
pendent of each other. It appears now to be proposed
not merely to unite museums, but to unite into one body
the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.
This project would seem to have originated at a meeting
which a deputation from the latter body had with Major
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Donnelly. It is evident that many difficulties would be
removed and many advantages result from the amalga-
mation of these two societies. Of course the arrangements
for such an amalgamation must be carried out entirely by
the societies, though it would no doubt tend to forward
such a scheme if the societies were assured of the approval
of Government, and of such aid towards taking the
necessary steps as the Government has in its power to
give.
We understand further that there is some possibility of
an amalgamation of the Royal Agricultural Society of
Ireland with the Royal Dublin Society. It is most desir-
able that such an amalgamation should be effected, and
that the agricultural shows should be removed from the
present buildings beside Leinscer House to the Phoenix
Park.
From a letter which has been published in the Irish
papers, it appears that these points have been submitted
by Major Donnelly to Lord Sandon, who has informed
him that the Government are prepared to aid the amal-
gamation and to give the necessary space in the Phcentx

ON A MODIFIED CARDIOGRAPH
T""vR. A. L. GALABIN, whose investigations with the
*-J sphygmograph and cardiograph we have had the
opportunity of noticing on former occasions (vide Nature,
vol. xii. p. 275), has introduced a modification of the car-
diograph, a woodcut drawing of which, through the kind-
ness of the Council of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical
Society, we are able to reproduce from their "Transac-
tions."
The cardiograph of Marey is too well known to require
description ; suffice it to say that it depends for its action
on the transmission through air-filled tubes of movements
from one stretched elastic membrane to another. In it,
therefore, errors originating in the tubes are introduced;
and these, from practical experience, are found to be con-
siderable. More than one physiologist has obtained far
more satisfactory " cardiograms " by applying the sphyg-
mograph, which was originally constructed by its in-
ventor—M, Marey—for the purpose of recording the
movements of the pulse at the wrist, upon the chest-wall,
in the intercostal spaces. This instrument, when thus
applied, reproduces in a most faithful manner the move-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ments of the chest-walls as there produced by the sub-
jacent heart in action; and in the healthy subject any
accessory apparatus is rarely reeded for the satisfactory
production of the tracings.
In many pathological conditions, and in the healthy
subject when the cardiac movements are more than ordi-
narily powerful, the movements of the heart are trans-
mitted to the neighbouring ribs, on which the sphygmo-
graph has to be supported, as well as to the more yielding
intercostal tissues. Under these circumstances it is far
better to employ, as supports for the instrument, more
fixed points, which must, from the nature of the chest-
wall, be at some distance from the centre of cardiac
movement. Dr. Galabin's apparatus supplies us with the
means needed. It is an expanded framework constructed
in a manner which allows of its being firmly applied to a
considerable expanse of the irregularly-shaped chest.
From the drawing its principle can be best understood
(See Figure).
In the middle of the figure the sphygmograph is seen.
It differs from M. Marey's original in one or two minor

knife-edge by means of which the recording lever is set
in motion is fixed, can be varied in length; and this
makes it possible to vary the magnifying power of the
lever, because the distance of the knife edge from its axle
can be changed. Such an addition has always been
a desideratum, even in the wrist sphygrnograph. The
screw, c, clamps the two component parts in any desired
position. A second reserve knife-edge, D, can also be
turned up to replace the ordinary one, A, when the
cardiac action is extraordinarily forcible. By the screw,
K, the compress-spring is fixed. L is the secondary spring,
which prevents the recording lever from quitting the
knife-edge; it can be thrown out of gear when not
required.
The supporting bars are seen at H H; they re-
placing the side-lappets of the original instrument. On
them are fixed uprights, G G G, on which again are
attached by screw-clamps two transverse bars for the
suspension of the sphygrnograph. That to which the
clock-work end is joined can only be moved upon the
uprights with which it is connected. The other has an

additional sliding-piece, I, that allows of the screw-pad
portion being independently raised or lowered in a hinged
manner.
That this suspending stage will prove of great service
in the study of the heart's action there can be no doubt.
The presence of the large number of movable centres
must, however, render its adjustment somewhat difficult.
It will be seen in the figure that the recording plate above
the watch-work is of considerable depth. We have found,
practically, that it is never advantageous to allow the
oscillations of the lever to reach nearly so great an am-
plitude as this will permit; and it is known by all that it
is very important that the average level of the lever's
tracing should never be far above that line which is per-
pendicular to the tangent of the circle formed by the
lever in its movements, at the point where the two cut
one another.
Whilst on the subject of Dr. Galabin's cardiograph
and sphygrnograph work, we may incidentally draw at-
tention to a point in a paper by him in the January
number of the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. Dr.
Galabin there comments on Mr. Garrod's law respecting
the length of the cardiac systole as it appears in the
arterial system—that it is constant for any given pulse-
rate, and varies as the cube root of the rate. He remarks,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"I have found the length of the systolic portion of the
pulse-curve to deviate somewhat considerably from that
deduced from the equation. ... It appears to be approxi-
mately true in normal pulses." Would it not have been
better if Dr. Galabin had given a larger number of
examples—he having confined himself to two, of which
one is pathological? In the paper in which the law
was announced, the agreement of the measurements with
the requirements was very close, and others have been
published since, even more satisfactory ; it has also been
indicated by its author that a pathological condition, like
anaemia (the instance taken), is just such an one as that
in which a deviation might be expected. Mr. Edgar
Thurston, of King's College, has recently read a paper
before the Medical Society of that School, which is
quite in confirmation of the law as originally stated, from
a considerable number of observations on healthy sub-
jects.

s a valuable one. But it must be remembered that it is
lot a personal question, which admits of the simple solu-
.ion that Mr. Tuckwell can teach science and that Mr.
Wilson cannot, but a general one: can science be taught to
young boys by the rank and file of science teachers, who
are, or will be when they are numerous, neither more nor
Less able and enthusiastic than the rank and file of classical
teachers, very average sort of people? I do not doubt
for a moment that my old pupil West can teach little
boys science with great advantage, but I doubt very
much whether there exist fifty Wests as schoolmasters at
any one time in England; and to justify making his
practice universal we want to be certain of finding five
thousand or fifty thousand such men as teachers. Let it
be remembered that very dry and dull men teach classics,
and not very badly, while the same men would teach a
science class nothing, or worse than nothing.
I wish Dr. Farrar, of Marlborough, would give us his
opinion on this whole question. He has had unusual
opporluniues for forming an opinion and has, no doubt,
used them ; and 1 do not know to what conclusions he

has arrived.
Mr. Gerstl's proposal to teach facts only—-facts in
italics—is truly fearful to me. I fancy an honest stupid
man, like some I know, teaching conscientiously what he
considers the facts of chemistry or botany, or mechanics;
and selecting a book the counterpart of Page's " Advanced
Text-book of Geology," or Nicolay's "Physical Geo-
graphy," bristling with facts. The facts of botany, in the
hands of most teachers, would be a dreary list I suspect.
Mr. Gerstl mayteich facts alone successfully, but could
the rank and file of our profession do the same?
I will most willingly admit, on the contrary, and main-
tain, that there exists an early science teaching that is at
once useful and well-timed: the excitement and gratifica-
tion of disinterested curiosity about nature; it is to do
for a class, if possible, what an intelligent and encyclo-
paedic father would do for an intelligent child. But how
difficult this is for bored and weary schoolmasters! It
is so much easier to tell them to get up up pp. x to y
in Oliver or Ansted.
One and only one English book do I know that might
almost make a stupid man teach one science well; and
that is Mrs. Kitchener's "A Year's Botany" (Rivington's).
That happily does not teach facts only; but is the ex-
pression of the method of a first-rate teacher in such a
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
form as to enable any one to follow it. And yet I tremble
as I mention it, for fear some class of tinies shall be
ordered to get it and learn the first six pages for their first
lesson in botany.
To conclude, therefore, for I will write no more on this
matter, what I advise is to interest young boys in science
by conversation, by informal teaching, by Natural History
Societies, by encouraging collections, aquariums, &c,
but not, except in the case of having that rare thing, a
genius for the science master (by which I mean a genius
for being a master, not a genius for science), to make
science a regular subject of class teaching in the lower
forms; but to teach the other subjects well. Then to
bring in science as compulsory on all, first as Physical
Geography and Astronomy or Botany, then as Chemistry
with laboratory work, and Physics ; and after two or three
years to let boys choose their own lines. Some will drop
it, others will pursue it further. This is one opinion, in
brief, on the right place of science in liberal education.
Now let us hear wnat others have to say.

In No. 13 of the Journal d'llygiine. Dr. de Pietra Santa

men of keeping steadily in view the two-fold function of climat-
ology, which is, in the first place, to collect, by means of accu-
rate instruments and simple methods, regular meteorological
observations; and in the second place, to observe and study
carefully the influence of these phenomena in their physiological
and pathological relations. In the latter case the attention must
be directed to types and sequences of weather which meteorolo-
gists have scarcely yet made subjects of investigation.

the Faculty of Sciences. At the age of twenty-four years he
discovered the element Bromine, and about 1S33 was appointed
Professor of Physics to the Montpellier School of Pharmacy and
Professor of Chemistry to the Faculty of Sciences. He mani-
fested great perseverance and energy in his researches on the
utilisation of sea-water for obtaining various saline bodies, and
it was while at Montpellier as professor that he made his fine
experiments on hypochlorous acid and amylic alcohol. In 1843
he succeeded M. Thenard at the Sorbonne, and in 1846 he was,
besides, appointed Superintendent of Lectures at the Upper
Normal School. In both positions he acquired a high reputation
for his solid instruction and his eminent qualities as a professor.
In 1854 he was appointed Professor of General Chemistry at the
College de France, a post which he held till his death. lie
shortly after quitted his position at the Sorbonne to become
Inspector-General of Superior Education. In this capacity he
never lost an opportunity of impressing upon teachers the great
importance of introducing experimental science into schools;
the want of apparatus he considered no difficulty, as for such
simple experiments as are required in a school, the teacher, he
thought, might easily devise his own apparatus. In 1846 he was
made a member of the Academy of Sciences, and other well-
deserved honours were awarded him. M. Balard's efforts and
discoveries were mainly directed to the economic applications of
science, and in this respect he has done much valuable work;

and in the future his researches in the utilisation of sea-water
may probably turn out to be of even greater practical value than
they have hitherto been. M. Balard was a man who made
many friends, was warm-hearted and benevolent, and was loved
and respected by all who knew him. He has left no written
work behind him, but his personal influence in the advance of
science in France has been great.
Mr. Torrens has given notice that on April 24 he will ask

We are glad to know that the idea has been broached in New

expedition, and we hope it may grow and take substantial shape.

the first kind is devoid of tension, when they treat of the experi-
ment known as the induced cylinder. Yet the same physicists,
Verdet says, admit this want of tension when they treat of the
plate condenser, in the instrument known as Volti's condenser,
as if these two experiments were not identical. It is cleir, he
says, that a similar restriction of the same hypothesis is not
established, and that if there be dissimulated electricity upon two
conducting discs placed near each other, it ought also to exist,
although in a less proportion, on two cylindrical or spherical
conductors, such as are ordinarily employed in experiment*.
All this is confirmed by De la Rive;1 "the experiments of
Melloni," he says, "appear to me to account for these anomalies
in a satisfactory manner."
In Gehler's Vocabulary * we read that Munck, agreeing with
Plaff, did not admit the theory of Riess.
Prof. Tyndall thus expresses himself on the subject under dis-
cussion3:—"When an insulated conductor is under the influ-
ence of an electrified body, its repelled electricity is free; but its
attracted electricity is held captive by the inducing electrified
body. If for a moment we put the induced inductor into com-
munication with the earth, its free electricity is dissipated; and
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
if we remove to a distance the inducing electrified body, the
captive electricity becomes free, and is distributed over the sur-
face of the induced conductor." This manner of conceiving the
phenomenon of electrical induction agrees perfectly with the
new theory of Melloni, which, we maintain, satisfactorily ex-
plains the same phenomenon.
Finally, Melloni communicated to the Paris Academy of
Sciences4 (July 24, 1854) his ideas on electrical induction,
and maintained, adducing all his reasons in support, that there
was ground for amending the theory of induction commonly
adopted, that it must be admitted that induced electricity of the
first kind did not possess tension, and that the homonym of the
inductor is found on every point of the induced body, including
the extreme point nearest to the inductor.
After having given this brief but complete resume of the
various opinions which have been enunciated on the question,
showing that there have never been wanting eminent physicists
to maintain that indue d electricity of the first kind is entirely
devoid of tension, I sh:i1l now recount my own observations and
experiments, by which, if I am not mistaken, I have proved the
truth of Melloni's the iry of electrical induction.
EXPERIMENTS.—The experiments I am about to describe
should be made when the air is sufficiently dry, as then only are
the results perfectly satisfactory.
Hrst Experiment.—Upon the conducting cylinder, induced and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
insulated, the following five facts are proved :—I. On the same
cylinder the two opposite electricities exist without neutralising
each other. 2. If the extremity of the cylinder nearest to the in-
ductor is put into communication with the earth, it is only the
homonym of the inductor which is dissipated and not at all the
opposite electricity. 3. Of the two kinds of electricity which
are in the cylinder, the homonym of the influent alone is dissi-
pated by contact with the air. 4. Points applied to the ex-
tremity of the cylinder nearest to the inductor allow only the
homonym of the inductor to escape and not at all the opposite
electricity. 5. Induced electricity of the first kind is not trans-
ferred from the induced body to the inductor, but the electricity
of the inductor may certainly be transferred to the induced body.
These five experimental facts cannot be logically explained by
the old theory of electrical induction, but only by the new,
showing that induced electricity of the first kind does, not
possess tension, i.e., that it is entirely dissimulated, and that
induced electricity of the second kind, i.e., the homonym of the
inductor, is entirely free on all points of the induced object.

that continuous electrophoroi furnish, when carefully examined,
a clear proof that induced electriciiy does not possess any tension.
In fact, in the case of these machines, as in that of frictional
machines, the conducting spikes of the prime conductor possess
the two opposite electricities co-existent on the same points ; this
is easily shown by means of a very small proof-plane.1
Thirteenth Experiment.—It is shown, by means of Geissler's
tubes submitted to the electrical influence, that induced elec-
tricity of the first kind has no tension.3
Fourteenth Experiment.—Here it is observed that the proof-
plane, whether submitted or not to electrical induction, always
receives by contact a charge greater than that which is iree on
the element which it has touched. Then the coibent, always
indispensable in the construction of the proof-plane, receives, by
infiltration, a certain quantity of electricity, besides that obtained
by communication with the metallic part. This infiltration or
absorption varies not only with the nature of the coibent, but
also with its quantity, within certain limits. This communica-
tion * contains other observations on electrical induction, and it
is concluded that on the extremity of the induced body nearest
to the inductor, the two opposite electricities coexist, and that

consequently induced electricity of the first kind has no tension.
It is also concluded that the homonym of the inductor is always
found on whatever point of the induced body this may be, and
that the homonym indicated is the only one to be dissipated,
because it alone is the only one endowed with tension.
Fifteenth Experiment.—In this is explained Nicholson's dupli-
cator, which is satisfactory, since it is based on the want of
tension in induced electricity of the first kind.1
Sixteenth Experiment.—In this is shown how we may shield
from curvilinear induction the electroscope which hangs from the
extremity of the induced body nearest to the inductor. From
this experiment it is concluded that the divergence of the straws
is due principally to curvilinear induction, and that induced elec-
tricity of the first kind does rot possess tension.5,
Stventeenth Experiment.—In this is analysed a little known
electrostatic phenomenon ; and from this analysis it follows that
induced electricity of the first kind has no tension.6
Eighteenth E-xpetiment.—It is shown mathematically that
electric induction does not traverse conducting masses. It is
afterwards observed that first the Florentine Academicians
and then Faraday admitted this truth. It is also observed that
if we admit that induced electricity of the first kind possesses no
tension, we arrive at the conclusion given below by means of
experiment.7

electric influence—I. Induced electricity of the first kind does
not possess tension. 2. It is found in greater quantity at the
extremity of the induced body nearest to the inductor, and
diminishes always as it approaches the other extremity. 3. In-
duced electricity of the second kind, i.e., the homonym of the
inductor, is found on every point of the induced body, not
excepting the extremity nearest to the inductor; it continually
increases in proportion as it approaches nearer to the other
extremity, and is always free.

a greater depth than 1,600 fathoms ; it is Fun^ia symmetrica.
Only three other corals have been obtained at as great a depth
as 1,500 fathoms. Only about twenty-seven genera of corals
have as yet been proved to exist in a depth of 250 fathoms and
upwards; of these a list is given, to which is added those ob-

reactions, whenever heat is communicated from a surface to a
gas, and vice versd, and the connection between these forces and
the motion caused by heat and light falling on bodies in vacuo.
Having obtained one of the beautiful little "Light-Mills"
constructed by Dr. Geissler, of Bonn, the author was in a
position to make quantitative measurements of the effects pro-
duced, and of the force producing them.
In the first place, with regard to the sufficiency of the residual
air to cause the motion. It was found that this air is, with the
exception of the friction of the pivot, which is found to be so
small as to be inappreciable, the sole cause of the resistance
which the mill experiences, of the limit which is imposed on its
speed for such intensity of light, and of the rapidity with which
it comes to rest when the light is removed. The law of resist-
ance, as determined by careful measurements, is found to agree
perfectly with the resistance which highly rarefied air would
offer to its motion; and this law is distinctly special in its cha-
racter, being proportional to the velocity at low speeds, and
gradually tending towards the square of the velocity as the speed
increases.
Having established the fact that there is sufficient air in the
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
mill (and Mr. Crookes's behaves in the same manner as this
mill) to balance, by its resistance, the force which moves the
mill, it is argued that all question as to the sufficiency of the air
to cause the forces is removed. What the air can prevent it can
cause.
As regards the possibility of the motion being in any way the
direct result of radiation. This supposition the author had pre-
viously shown to be directly contradicted by the fundamental
law of motion that action and reaction are equal. A cold body
runs away from a hot noily, while, if free to move, the hot body
will run after the cold body, showing that the force does not act
from body to body, but that each body propels itself through the
surrounding medium in a direction opposite to its hottest side,
the effect of one body on the other being due solely to the dis-
turbance which it causes in the equilibrium of temperature.
Besides proving that the force acts between the vanes of the
mill and the medium immediately surrounding them Dr. Schuster's
experiments furnish a quantitative measure of the actual force.
From this measure it is shown on theoretical grounds that the
difference of temperature on the two sides of the vanes neces-
sary to cause heat-reactions of this magnitude could not be less
than i°7, while the probability is that it is considerably more.
In order to apply this test and see how far the actual difference
of temperature in Dr. Schuster's experiments correspond with
that deduced from the theory, a new photometer was devised by

the author with an immediate view of measuring the difference of
temperature caused by light on a black and a white surlace.
Of two thin glass globes, 2 .J inches in diameter, connected by a
syphon tube i inch internal diameter, one was blackened with
lamp-black on the inside over one hemisphere and the other was
whitened with chalk in a similar manner, the two clean faces of
the globes being turned in the same direction. Oil was put in the
tube and the globes were otherwise sealed up. Any light which
enters through the clean faces is received on the black and white
surfaces, and the air in the globes expands in accordance with
the difference of temperature which they attain, moving the oil in
the tube. A motion of J an inch on the part of the oil shows a
difference of 2° -2, in the temperature of the air within the globes.
The instrument so constructed is exceedingly delicate, and will
show a difference in the intensity of light sufficient to make one
revolution per minute difference in the speed of the null.
Measured with this instrument, the difference of temperature
caused by the light necessary to give the mill 240 revolutions per
minute does not exceed 24°, and is probably less than this, which
shows that the theoretical difference of heat necessary to cause
the heat-reactions is well within the difference as actually mea-

composed of six or seven ranges of irregular plates, each perfo-

Note on the phosphates of the Laurentian and Cambrian rocks
o( Canada, by Principal Dawson, F.R.S. The author described
the mode of occurrence of phosphatic deposits in various locali-
ties in Canada. Dark phosphatic nodules, containing fragments
of Lingu/i?, abound in the Chazy formation at Allumette Island,
Grenville, Hawkesbury, and Lochiel. Similar nodules occur in
the Graptolite shales ol the Quebec group at Point Levis, and in
limestones and conglomerates of the Lower Potsdam at Riviere
Ouelle, Kamouraska, and elsewhere on the lower St. Laurence;
these deposits also contain small phosphatic tubes resembling
Serpulites. The Acadian or Menevian group near Si. John,
New Brunswick, contains layers of calcareous sandstone black-
ened with phosphatic matter, consisting of shells and fragments
of Lingula. The author described the general character of the
phosphatic nodules examined by him at Kamouraska, and gave
the results of analyses made of others from various localities,
which furnished from 3638 to 55*65 per cent, of phosphate of
lime. A tube from Kiviere Ouelle gave 6y53 per cent. The

author accepted Dr. Hunt's view of the coprolitic nature of the
nodules, and inclined to extend this interpretation to the tubes.
The animals producing the coprolites could not be thought to
be vegetable ieeders; and he remarked that the animals inha-
biting the primordial seas employed phosphate of lime in the
formation ot their hard parts, as had been shown to be the case
with Lingula, Conularta, and the Crustaceans. The shells of
the genus HyoHthcs also contain a considerable portion of phos-
phate of lime. Hence the carnivorous animals ol the Cambrian
seas would probably produce phosphatic coprolites. With iegard
to the Laurentian apatite deposits, the author stated that tliey,

ALL who are acquainted with the undoubted merits of
Mr. Campbell's earlier work—merits to which not
even the most serious and glaring defects in style, matter,
and arrangement can render us insensible—will hail with
pleasure the appearance of this latest production of his
ever lively pen and amusing pencil. We cannot but think
that in this, his second venture, the author has greatly
profited by some of the severe but not unfriendly criti-
cisms which were elicited by the publication of his first
work. Mr. Campbell has, in "My Circular Notes,"
avoided the grave mistake of mingling together in wild
confusion humorously-written notes of travel and sober
arguments on difficult scientific questions; and he has
exercised, as we think, a very wise discretion in relegating

to an appendix the discussion of that important geological
problem, the hope of solving which seems to have been
his main incitement to undertaking this journey round
the world. In perusing this scientific portion of his book,
with which of course the readers of Nature are princi-
pally concerned, we are happy to find far fewer examples
of that looseness and inaccuracy of language and to miss
that dogmatic tone and redundancy of illustration which
were the conspicuous blemishes of the author's earlier
work. And all these improvements have we think been
effected, without any sacrifice of his really graphic and
vigorous style of writing upon scientific questions.
Before proceeding to notice the purely scientific portion
of " My Circular Notes," we must remark that, even those
who care nothing about the geological problems discussed
in it, will find very much to interest them in this most lively
and amusing record of travels. Those who would realise
the curious scenes which may be witnessed in the Western
States of North America, where the most volatile elements
of old nationalities are uniting to form a new community—
those who take interest in that wonderful social experi-
ment which is now being tried in Japan, no less a one

relics of the ancient nations, languages, folk-lore, and
creeds of Ceylon—cannot do better than accept the
guidance of Mr. Campbell. In him they will find a most
vivacious and ever-amusing companion. Yet, on the
other hand, his digressions upon such subjects as emigra-

aimed at something higher than merely writing a diverting

follows :—At the present time glaciers enter the sea, within
the northern hemisphere, down to the latitude of 6o°; the
sea is frozen and ice-marks are produced on the shore as
far south as 400; and icebergs drop their rocky burdens
within 37° degrees of the equator. If there ever prevailed
a universal glacial period with a general reduction in the
temperature of the whole northern hemisphere, we ought
to find traces of glacial action everywhere round the
whole globe and extending even to more southern lati-
tudes than 37°. If the ice-cap " ever existed, the marks'of
it ought to be found on all meridians alike. If ever there
was a glacial period in our world, glacial marks ought to
be found everywhere, in the same latitudes and at the
same levels, in the same state of preservation."
Keeping these premises constantly before his mind, our
author found, during his journey of eleven months, quite
sufficient evidence to cause him to make a full retraction
of his former conclusions on the subject. As far as
Chicago he observed everywhere the most striking
traces of former glacial action; but in the same latitudes
to the westward he found these marks of old glaciers

entirely disappearing ; and although some signs of glacial
action were detected in the Rocky Mountains themselves,
yet from this great range onwards to Ceylon they were
found to be wholly wanting. Mr. Campbell's previous
expedition in eastern Europe had led him to conclusions
as to the local character of glacial action which were quite
in harmony with those obtained in this journey round
the globe, and he enunciates the results of his latest obser-
vations upon the subject as follows :—" Whether I take
marks which can be explained by glacial erosion, such as
firths, valleys, lakes, &c, or marks which clearly are not
glacial, such as peaks,and canons, I find nothing to suggest
a general glacial period in America or in Europe;" and
he further proceeds to state that he can find no evidence
whatever of a recurrence of universal glacial periods such
as might result from the action of some astronomical
cause.
We have already extended this notice of Mr. Camp-
bell's valuable work to the farthest limits, and must refer
to the book itself for the details of the evidence on which
his conclusions are founded.
In bringing our remarks to a close, we may add
that the author's present views on the influence pro-
duced on climate by the changes of level in different
districts, resulting in alterations in the direction of

ocean currents, Sec, appear to be quite in harmony
with those so long and firmly maintained by Lyell, in
opposition to the cosmical theories of the extreme
glacialists. His observations on Western North America
are fully confirmed by the more detailed examination of
the districts by several of the United States' geologists;
and his conclusion that there is no evidence of the former
existence of a general "Glacial period" are quite in
accordance with those enunciated by Dr. Hector and
other observers who have studied the glaciers of the
southern hemisphere. Prof. Nordenskjbld has, moreover,
shown how completely pakcontological evidence of the
clearest character disposes of the notion of frequently
recurring glacial epochs in past geological times.
We cannot but admire the candour with which Mr.
Campbell renounces his previously-expressed opinions;
and we may, perhaps, be allowed to express a hope that
the facts and arguments which have led him to so gtcaty
modify his views on glacial phenomena, will not be with-
out effect on the minds of others, who, like him, havs
certainly pushed their conclusions derived from a stuc;

Mr. Frost's work is an elementary one, inasmuch as no
advanced acquaintance with the differential and integral
calculus is required; nor do his methods turn upon the
higher algebra, nor upon the science of projections.
Indeed he is careful to restrict himself for the most part
to fairly elementary processes. It is not a complete
treatise, as he does not touch upon roulettes or upon
curves, given by intrinsic equations. These latter curves
have been, as is well known, discussed and fully illustrated
in the late Dr. Wheweli's two memoirs in the Cambridge
Philosophical Transactions (vols. viii. and ix.) We miss,
too, all account of curves of historical interest. Occa-
sional notices of these have been given by different
writers, but we should like a sketch of them drawn up by
some competent hand, with an account of their origin and
applications.
Reasons have weighed with Mr. Frost in making these
omissions, and we do not grumble at his taking his own
line in his treatment of the subject as he has given us a

covered compounds we are of opinion that a short biblio-

are first made known would have greatly increased the
valne of the articles without materially adding to their
length. The author has fallen into an error in treating
of thermo- and pyro-electricity under the same heading;

Clouds in the East. Travels and Adventures on the
Pcrso-Turkoman Frontier. By Valentine Baker. With
Maps and Illustrations. (London : Cha'.to and Windus,
>876-) . ....
THE author of this interesting volume had special facili-
ties for visiting the Russian outposts in Asia and the
Persian frontier; he had powerful recommendations to
the highest Russian and Persian authorities. By various
causes, however, he was prevented from taking complete
advantage of these, so that the main part of his work
dtscribes his journeys in the district to the south of the
Caspian, and from Teheran towards the north-east Per-
sian frontier. He reached the Caspian by Trebizond and
Tiflis, and gives some interesting particulars as to naviga-
tion on the inland sea. He was able to visit the mouth
of the much-talked-of Attrek, and found that the Gurgan,
to the south of the Attrek, is the real Russian frontier in

this region. He was unfortunately prevented from visiting
Merv and Herat, which he had intended to do. Mr.
Biker's main objects were sport and to ascertain the real
nature of the advances made by Russia in Central Asia.
Of the former he got a fair amount around Teheran, and
his work will be of very considerable importance to those
who arc interested in the movements of Russia. He took
considerable pains to ascertain Persian feeling on the
question; Persia cannot understand, or rather misun-
derstands, England's inaction. Mr. Baker gives many
valuable notes as to the nature of the country passed
over, its productions, antiquities, and inhabitants. Con-
cerning the Turkomans especially, and their wonder-
ful houses, many details will be found. Altogether the
work is an intelligent and interesting narrative of travel
in an important region, and a substantial contribution to
the Asian question. There are three gcod maps, but the
chromolithographs are very poor specimens of their
kind.

2. "W. 13. D." asserts that in every one of the cases cited by
me (I cite one or two hundred) to prove "the ages" simul-
taneous, "there is no proof that the deposit has not been dis-
turbed."
I select by way of reply five examples : the pile-village at

planted here on a palaeolithic station, "as he was informed by
Dr. Broca at the French Association at Lyons in 1873." "In
this case," he proceeds, "which is made the basis of the attack
on the high antiquity of palaeolithic men, the human skulls are
comparatively modern, and the refuse heap of an untold age."
This statement implies both ignorance and a treacherous
memory,on the part of " W. B. D.

We are all aware that there are Merovingian remains at
Solutre. There are also Roman or Gallo-Roman remains. But
the argument from Solutre is this: (1) That the bones of the
extinct animals found in association with the flint implements
have preserved a portion of their gelatine, and that the horns of
the reindeer, when cut, yield the odour of fresh horn. (2) That
the Hint implements found, though unpolished, are of very
superior and advanced workmanship, hardly inferior to the
beautiful specimens from Denmark. (3) That there are found
here the remains of some 40,0x1 horses, and that the horse was
probably domesticated. (4) That there are numerous instru-
ments here of paleolithic date, some of them in carefully closed
stone cists or boxes. The remark of "W. B. D." about the
Merovingian graves has therefore no application except in connec-
tion with (3) and (4); as regards (3), the hone-deposit, as it is
called (outside of the refuse-heaps), some of which was compacted
into a solidified mass—contained the flint implements and the
bones of the mammoth, reindeer, Sec. ; and, in addition, extendid
beneath the most ancient fire-places, or heirlhs, containing the
paleolithic skeletons and the flints and the bones of the reindeer
and mammoth. The horse-remains are not, therefore, Mero-
vingian. As regards (4), and the assertion, on the authority of
Dr. Broca, that the graves are Merovingian ; this whole subject
came up at the French Association at Lyons in 1873 ; the Asso-
ciation visited Solutre" ; and by way of reply to what " W. B. D."
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
says he gathered from Dr. Broca, I quote from the report of the
Proceedings of the Association in " Matcriaux pour l'Histoire de
l'llomme," 7', 8°, and of Livraisons, 1873, pp. 324, 325, 342.
When M. Cartaiihac observed that "the discussion was of the
greatest gravity, and would remain celebrated in the history of
anthropological science," and that although there may have been
some d.sturbances of the soil, "one thing remained certain, viz.,
that in more than ten instances, a human skeleton had been
found on a quaternary fireplace, and not one fact exists to be
opposed to the admission of their contemporaneity"—when M.
Cartaiihac had expressed himself to this effect, the report
proceeds :—
"M. Broca pattage cettc opinion ct declare ouverte la discus-
sion sur le deuxieme probleme : les chenaux."
Subsequently, participating further in the discussion (p. 342),
M. Broca stated that he had examined twenty-five skulls from
Solutre, and that of this number seventeen belonged to the
epoch of the reindeer—"a la veritable epoque paleolithique

In a careful examination, however, of the whole argument of
the authors of the " Unseen Universe," it looks to me as though
they saw clearly to what their course of reasoning, as far as this
particular point is concerned, tended, but were willing to stop
short of the true logical result, believing that humanity was not
yet prepared to admit that we are only a small part of one
stupendous whole, a universe of individual life.
Of the main object and scope of their argument I have
nothing to i>ay, only this: if the premises assumed—and they
are the assumptions of the modern school of science— are cor-
rect, there is nothing unreasonable in the conclusions at which
the authors have arrived.
Note.—Since writing the above I have seen the authors' pre-
face to the second ed.lion oi the "Unseen Universe," in which
they say: "To reduce maters to order, we may confidently
assert that the only reasonable and defensive alternative to our
hypothesis (or, at least, something similar to it) is the stupendous
pair of assumptions that visible matier is eternal, and that it is
alive. If anyone can be found to uphold noti ns like these
(from a scientific point of view), we shall be happy to enter the

Whether matter is eternal and each individual particle or

isolated teeth. In the early Miocene a very interesting
form occurs, named Amphicyon, characterised by the
greater development of the tubercular molars, which are
not only larger relatively than in modern dogs, but the
one missing in them is present, making the typical num-
ber complete. In addition to this generalisation in the
dental characters, they possessed five toes on each foot,
whereas the modern dogs have lost the hallux. They were
large heavy-limbed animals, and have been supposed to
present affinities to the bears, which, however, they only
do inasmuch as they are more generalised carnivora
than are the typical dogs. Remains have been found in
various Miocene deposits in France, Germany, Italy, and
some assigned to the same genus in North America. It
is doubtful if the cynoid or dog-like type of carnivore was
distinctly recognisable in the Eocene period, for the Cams
parisiensis of the Paris gypsums was founded on a single
tooth.
From the dogs, which hold a very central position
in the order, the other existing members deviate in

"make the nearest approach to the seals, and the other
through the civets and hyaenas to the cats, the most
highly specialised and characteristic carnivores. The
true bears are especially distinguished by the great deve-
lopment of the tubercular and the suppression of the
sectorial portion of the molar series. The peculiar den-
tition of a bear is, for a carnivorous animal, highly
specialised, and, as might be expected, appears to be a
comparative recent introduction upon the earth, not ex-
tending beyond the Pliocene epoch, though several tran-
sitional forms occur, as Arctotherium bonariensisof South
America, and Hyanarctos sivalensis of the Siwalik Moun-
tain, and H. insignis of the Pliocene of Montpellier. Otters
have been traced back to the Pliocene in France, and an
allied form Potamoiherium, to the Miocene. Enhydriodon
is a large otter-like animal from the Siwalik Hills, with
very broad and tuberculated molars. The evidence
as to the ancient history of the Mustelidce is not very
satisfactory, as isolated teeth, by which many of the
fossil forms are known, are not sufficient indications as to
their general characters.
True Viverrida are met with in the European Mio-
cenes, one genus, Ictitherium, forming a transition to the

existing species, and continued abundant until the close
of the Pleistocene, but are now restricted to Africa and
Asia. The species so common in the British caves
appears to have been identical with the Spotted Hyxna
(II. croaetd) of Africa, and the Striped Hyaena (H.striata),
has been found fossil in France. The genus has not
been met with in America.
The Felidce present the most complete adaptive modi-
fication of the carnivorous type for a predatory existence.
The jaws are short and wide, the incisors very small, the
canines powerful, and the molar series shortened, and its
sectorial element developed almost to the complete sup-
pression of the tubercular portion. The limbs and claws
have undergone corresponding specialisations. The
family has now a very wide distribution, and has existed
both in Europe and America since the Miocene period.
It acquired one most remarkable modification in the

may best be exhibited so as to satisfy all the purposes
for which they are intended. M. Felix Plateau, at a
former meeting, proposed to substitute yellow for colour-
less glass in lighting rooms containing entomological col-
lections. In the discussion which followed it was sug-
gested that experiments should be made by submitting
insects to the influence of glasses of various colours. M.
Capronnicr was entrusted with carrying out these experi-
ments, and the paper referred to contains his report.
Everyone knows that among the Lcpidoptera it is the
preen and carmine colours which arc most rapidly
destroyed by daylight. M. Capronnier wished to obtain
insects of the year's hatching, but could only obtain
sufficient quantities of Euchelia Jacobace, L. The inferior
wings of this insect are of a deep carmine, uniform in
tone, an important point in the experiments.
The principal colours of the solar spectrum are the
yellow, the red, the blue. M. Capronnier rejected the
red as giving a tint too dark, and added the mixed

He made five small square boxes of "08 centimetres
square and one centimetre in depth; the whole surface
was covered with one of the above-mentioned glasses.
Each wing was fixed in the middle of the box and
floated in a bath of very bright light, but protected from
the rays of the sun. Each of the wings was partly
covered by a band of black paper, and their position was
so arranged as to leave exposed successively each of the
parts during a period of fifteen, thirty, and ninety days.
The following are the results :—
Colourless glass.—After fifteen days of exposure the
carmine tint was visibly attacked. After thirty days the
alteration was more sensible, and after ninety days the
work of destruction had rapidly advanced, and the car-
mine had passed into a ) ellowish tint.
Blue.—With this tint the same alterations took place as
in the case of colourless glass.
Green.—This colour preserved the carmine during the
first fifteen days; a change was indicated on the
thirtieth day, and on the nintieth the alteration was
marked.
Yellow.—During the ninety days the yellow alone left
the carmine colour almost intact. M. Capronnier says
almost, for a slight alteration in the tint could be noticed

at the end of the ninety days. This last observatibn
proves that there is no absolute preservative, and that
collections must be kept in darkness, under penalty of
seeing them seriously changed at the end of a given
time.
Nevertheless, it is evident from the above that the
yellow is the best preservative against alterations in the
colours of insects. M. Capronnier consequently con-
cludes that a yellowish colour should be preferred and
combined in every arrangement of an entomological
room. Moreover the cloths that cover the show-cases
ought to be yellow rather than green, and what is im-
portant and indispensable, the window-blinds ought to be
absolutely yellow.

The work was begun from two points, Airolo and
Goeschenen, the two extremities of the future tunnel.
The advance of the gallery, which is pushed on with
activity, produces about 400 cubic metres of rubbish a
day at each of the two faces of attack. To carry away
this mass of rubbish, which is thrown regularly into
trucks running on rails, it is impossible to employ loco-
motives, as the cul de sac nature of the galleries prevents
effectual ventilation. The high price of horses and the
large number required prevent their use. The idea sug-
gested itself of making use for St. Gothard of machines
moved by compressed air, which would have many advan-
tages. First, it is well known that compressed air is
used to work the perforating machines used in boring the
tunnel; then by the employment of compressed air loco-
motives ventilation of the galleries would be produced, as
these machines would allow only pure air to escape; and
then these motors would be more powerful than hone;
and effect more rapidly the clearing away of the diiru.
A first attempt was made in which two ordinary loo
motives were employed, one at each side of the tunnel;

the boilers, in which, of course, there was no water, were
filled with condensed air under a pressure of four atmo-
spheres. This air played the part usually done by steaa
passed into slide valves, entered the cylinders
alternately on each face of the pistons, whid.
it set in motion, and then escaped into me
atmosphere.
It is easily seen that if compressed air were
to be employed, it would be indispensable ti
have a very considerable quantity of it; tie
boiler of a locomotive, sufficient when it is
worked by means of steam constantly pro-
duced under the action of heat, was too smi!
to contain a quantity of air sufficient for as
without being filled. This led to adding to
each locomotive a special reservoir for com-
pressed air; each locomotive was accom-
panied, as a kind of tender, by a long sheet-iron
cylinder, 8 metres long and i£ metres diameter, supported
towards its extremities by two trucks, which, on starting,
were filled with condensed air, and which communicated
by a tube with the distributing apparatus of the cylinders.
The locomotive then worked as before, except that com-
pressed air came from the reservoirs instead of from tie
boiler. The two locomotives, the Jieitss and the Tissk.

awkwardness of the long cylinders that accompanied
them. We can give some interesting figures resulting
from the mean of a certain number of observations. At
departure the pressure in the reservoir was about 7 kilo-
grammes per square centimetre; the locomotive having
drawn a train ot twelve loaded waggons along a course of
abou' 600 metres, the pressure was found to fall to 4J
kilogrammes; the train then returned empty to the point
of departure, and the final pressure was found to be 2\
kilogrammes.
In spite of the relatively advantageous results whico
were obtained, the employment of compressed air U> a
steam locomotive presented a certain number of dra*"
backs. It is expedient that the air should issue /«*

from the reservoir to enter during only a part of the
course of the piston. But the admission of the air
ought to vary if it is desired to obtain the same final
effect, since the pressure in the reservoir diminishes
continuously; and as the apparatus which regulates the
admission was arranged to correspond only to determined
fractions, but not to vary in a continuous manner, it fol-
lowed that there was a greater expenditure of air than
was necessary, and consequently a diminution in the
length of the course over which the locomotive could run.
On the other hand it is necessary that the air should
arrive in the distributing apparatus with the least possible
pressure, for it is in this apparatus, in the slide-value,
that the greatest losses take place, and these losses in-
crease in proportion to the pressure. No means could,
however, be thought of for diminishing the pressure in
the reservoirs, which would have reduced considerably
the work which the machines were capable of doing,
unless by augmenting considerably the volume of the
reservoirs, the dimensions of which Were already un-
usually large.

At this stage M. Ribourt, the engineer of the tunnel,
devised an arrangement which allows the compressed gas
to flow at a fixed pressure whatever may be the
pressure in the reservoir. The gas in escaping from the
reservoir enters a cylinder B (Fig. 1), over a certain
extent of the walls of which are openings m in, that
communicate with another cylinder c, which surrounds it
to the same extent, and which is connected with the slide-
valve by which the air is distributed, or, more generally,
with the space in which this air is to be utilised. On one
side moves a piston E, which shuts the cylinder and
hinders the escape of the air. This piston carries ex-
ternally a shaft F, which supports externally a spiral
spring H, the force of which is regulated by means of a
screw. Internally it is connected by another shaft L with
a second piston N, which bears a cylinder M, movable in
the interior of the principal pump, and forming thus a
sort of internal sheath. This sheath presents openings
tin, which may coincide exactly with those already
referred to, and in that case the gas passes without diffi-
culty from the reservoir at the point where it is to be
employed. But if the sheath is displaced, the openings
no longer correspond, there is resistance to the passage,
and consequently diminution of the quantity of gas which
flows out, and hence lowering of pressure in the exterior

cylinder. By making the position of the sheath to vary
continuously we may make the pressure of exit constant,
notwithstanding the continuous variation at entry. But
the apparatus is automatic. In fact the part of the cylinder
B comprised between the bottom and the piston n com-
municates by openings p (which are never covered with
the escape-tube of the gas), in such a manner that upon
its posterior face the piston n receives the pressure of the
gas at the moment when it flows, a pressure which it is
sought to render constant. The piston e receives on its
anterior face the action of the spring which can be regu-
lated at pleasure. As to the other faces of the two
pistons, they are subjected to equal actions proceeding
from the pressure of the gas at its entry, actions which
thus counteract each other; so that the forces which de-
termine the position of the movable system are on the
one hand the tension of the spring, a constant and deter-
mined force, and on the other hand, the pressure of the
flowing gas; and thus equilibrium cannot occur unless
the two forces are equal. If the gas should flow in too
great quantity, the pressure increases on the posterior face

of five classes. No science work (at present) is done in
the preparatory school, but all boys in the upper school
do some. With the lowest class the subjects are physical
geography, and in the summer, botany.
The two reasons why science should be taught in
schools arc (to quote from Mr. Wilson) that it "is the
best teacher of accurate, acute, and exhaustive observa-
tion of what is," and that "of all processes of reasoning
it stands alone as the exhaustive illustration." And the
teaching of physical geography and botany I regard as
fulfilling the first of these purposes. We enjoy unusual
advantages for the study of these two subjects in the
nature of the surrounding country. We are upon the
millstone grit, but only a few hundred yards from the great
Craven Fault, where the mountain limestone is elevated
some 800 feet above the grit into the Giggleswick Scar.

vertical Silurian rocks. Traces of glacial action are
numerous—the new line from Settle to Carlisle cuts

picked up by the dozen. Erratic blocks are scattered
thickly over the whole country. At hand we have the
Victoria Cave, and the remains it has yielded are pre-
served in the school museum, and we are within an alter-
noon's ramble of the summits of Ingleborough and Peny-
ghent, and of Clapham Cave, and numerous others. We
are equally well off in the matter of botany ; a radius of
six miles round the school probably includes a greater
variety of plants than any equal area in England.
Supposing a boy to enter the upper school at the age of
twelve, he would perhaps remain in the class for a year,
and at the age of thirteen would enter upon the systematic
study of science ; and his first subject would be chemistry,
which he would attack at once practically. Four hours a
week are given in this class to the study of chemistry—
a practical lesson of two hours and two oral lessons of an
hour each. In the class of perhaps twenty-five, all the
boys are making the same experiments at the same time,
and the work consists mainly in the study of the
properties of the salts of particular metals. The boys
are led to infer for themselves from their own experiments
the solubility or insolubility of the salts of the metals in
water, acids, &c, and from that to advance to simple
analysis. No text-book is used.
In the oral lessons we advance very slowly ; one term

suffices probably to get through not more than oxygen,
hydrogen, and water, and perhaps to begin air. It seems
to me that a boy learns much more by understanding
thoroughly the experimental evidence that nine pounds
of water contain eight pounds of oxygen, than in learning
'the " mode of preparation and properties " of the oxides
of nitrogen and a dozen other substances. In the next
class in which the average age is perhaps fourteen to
fifteen, we get through nitrogen, carbon, chlorine, bro-
mine, iodine, fluorine, and perhaps sulphur, practical
work being continued at the same rate as before.
In the second class we have two hours a week for
chemistry, two hours for practical work, and two hours
for physics. In physics we take the various branches in
succession, and get through the subjects of Balfour
Stewart's " Physics " in about two years, which is the time
many boys remain in the class, the ages being fifteen to
seventeen. In the first class we have eight hours a week.

for training the observing powers of pupils in the country;
which should be judiciously directed by the teacher so as
to render the observations continuous and systematic as
far as they go; they should be always duly recorded,
dated, and correctly described. But the encouragement
of making collections must be done cautiously, as boys
are too prone to be thoughtlessly cruel. Of course in-
formation on animals may be given informally. With
regard to botany nearly twenty years' experience of teach-
ing boys and girls of all ages and of nearly all classes, has
convinced me that it may be commenced as soon as one
likes. The plan pursued by my father at Hitcham (of
which an account will be found in the Leisure Hour for
1862, p. 676) clearly proved the advantage to be derived
by village school children, and I can corroborate it by my
own attempts in another village; for there was a marked
increase in the general intelligence, to say nothing of
botany giving the children an amusing and instructive
employment in the fields instead of their idling in the
street—a fact noticed and strongly approved of by their
parents. This subject, whatever may be the objections

to others, can be taught to almost infants.
With regard to electricity, magnetism, and the elements
of chemistry, beyond the last of these, I have no expe-
rience, but should fancy that the manipulation required
would be unattainable before the ages of eleven or twelve,
and the abstract nature of force would scarcely commend
itself lo the understanding before that age.
Physical geography, however, is another subject which,
although affording less scope for the observing powers as
botany, is by no means absolutely wanting in this respect.
I cannot say that my "young boys [were] more (or less)
attentive, active-minded, diligent when they [were] doing
arithmetic than when they [were] at a lesson on physical
geography." One principle I would insist upon is to
appeal to the eye, as well as or rather more than the
imagination, of young people. Hence in teaching this
science, where no direct observation of the facts is pos-
sible (as of glaciers, in Warwickshire), my plan was to
procure abundant and good illustrations, while the chief
facts connected with their motions and formations would
be illustrated by diagrams on the black board. Yet the
effects of river and atmospheric action may be actually
seen, often to a considerable extent, everywhere; and
marine action having been learnt and understood at
school, has been eagerly looked for when a visit to the

sea-side was forthcoming. Here, however, not only facts
should be taught, but their causes, or forces in action
which have produced them and the study will then never
be dry. Physical geography has its value in realising in
the pupil's mind the true nature of sequences between
cause and effect, and he thus begins to grasp the funda-
mental principle of philosophy or " continuity" of action.
I have found boys of eight thoroughly able to appreciate
the elements of the subject; of course by adapting the
facts and reasoning to their capacities.
Physical geography, being simply "modern geology,"
should invariably precede geology, which above all sub-
jects cultivates inductive reasoning, and I have found boys
from about twelve well able to grasp the main facts and
reasonings. If they happen to be near any fossiliferous
strata or where a variety of rock specimens may be
procured, the encouragement to collect as many as
possible should be given at any preceding age, for the
most fascinating pursuit in science is undoubtedly col-
lecting. (I have to this day crag shells collected at the

March 11, we learn that the past winter has been particularly mild,
the cold having been at no time either persistent or severe. The

what did fall quickly disappeared. The absence of snow
allowed cattle and horses almost always to get good pastur-

on the intensity, or (the same thing) the amplitude of the vibra-
tions. He gave an affirmative answer, and said that the wave-
length increases with the intensity. In view of the important

issues involved, M. Lipplch has recently been led to repeat the ex-
periments, and with arrangements of greater accuracy (about 2,000
times, as he estimates, more accurate than Midler's). From this
investigation, of which an account appears in the Silzungsberichtc
nf the Vienna Academy, he concludes, in opposition toMiiller, that
the wave-length of light, whether in free ether, or in any ponder-
able media, is independent of the intensity of the light vibra-
tions, and so, the duration of vibration being given, a constant
depending only on the nature of the medium considered at rest.
The time elapsing between the action of an external stimulus
on some part of the body, and the giving of a signal (previously
agreed upon) in reply, has been determined in the case of several
senses, by various experiments. A short time ago M M. Vintsch-
gau and Hdnigschmied sought to determine this "reaction-
time '' for sensations of taste on the point of the tongue ; and in
the subject experimented on, this was found to be, for ordinary
salt, 01598', for sugar 01639", f°r *Qi& 0*1676", and for quinine
02351". It is interesting to compare the results which the same
observers have recently obtained in further experiments as to
the reaction-time for sensations of touch on the tongue. This,
in the same individual, was found to be 01507'' in the case of
the tongue being touched with a pencil; a smaller value, there-
fore, than that of the shortest interval in the former case of
taste. In the middle of the tongue the reaction-time, on
touching with a pencil, was o'I527". A weak electric stimula-

tion of the tongue-point was answered after 0*1813', whereas
with a stronger electric stimulus the answer came in o,J452".
These numbers represent^ in all cases, the averages of all the
experiments. It wid be seen, then, that the point of the tongue
is most sensitive for strong electric stimuli, and the order of
sensibility for the remaining stimuli, was (for this individual):
Contact, saltness, sweetness, sourness, weak electric stimulation,
and bitterness. Other persons on whom similar measurements
were made, gave values that were different both relatively and
absolutely, and the results for different persons appear to be not
comparable together. Various secondary influences play an
important part, among which may be cited the thickness of the
mucous membrane at the particular part experimented on ; this
may considerably increase the reaction-time. An estimate of the
comparative sensibility of the separate organ of sense can best
be had from comparisons in one and the same individual.

In nearly ail thi species of naked and covered-eyed Medusa;
which I ha 1 the opportunity o( examining, there was a remark-
able absence of monstrous or mis-shapen forms. In the case of
one species, however, such forms were of frequent occurrence.
This species was Aurelia aurita, and the monstrosities showed
themselves l>L>tii as abnormal multiplications and abortions of
parts. In all the cases of asymrr.e rical multiplication which I
observed, the ] eculiarity was confined to the lithocysts, and
always showed itself in the same manner. That is to say, I
have several times observed, in otherwise normal specimens of
Aurelia aurita, the presence of nine instead of eight lithocysts,
and in all these cases the supernumerary lithocyst—which was
always fully formed and provided with the u-iial hool—was

placed beside and in close contact with one of the normal litho-
cysts. This latter fact appears to me important when considered
in relation to the theory of Pangenesis; for upon this theory it
would follow that if a supernumerary lithocyst is to be deve-
loped at all, we should expect it to be so in apposition with one
of the normal lithocysts rather than in any other position. Our
ground for expecting this, of course, is that the theory of Pan-
genesis supposes similar gemmules to have a mutual affinity for
one another; and as lithocyst gemmules would naturally be
plentiful in the region of any normal lithocysts during the pro-
cess of its development, or of its repair if injured, if anything
went slightly wrong in either of these processes, facilities would
be offered for the adhesions of improper gemmules at the point
where the disturbing cause acted, and these improper adhesions
having once taken place, and being then followed by normal
adhesions of proper gemmules, the result would probably be a
duplex organ.
I have said that in all the cases of asymmetrical multiplication
of parts which fell under my notice, it was the lithocysts alone
that were affected. But besides these cases of asymmetrical
multiplication of parts in Aurelia, I saw several instances of

system, and tentacles—underwent a marked decrease; so that at
la«t I was only able to obtain specimens one half or one quarter
the ordinary size of Aurelia aurita, and having nearly all their
natural rose-pink colour discharged. I believe that these two
phenomena—the loss of colour and the diminution in size—are
related to one another in a very intimate manner. Just at the
time of year when these two phenomena began to manifest them-
selves, I observed that all the specimens of Aurelia I met with
were infested by a species of crustacean, which lodged chiefly in
the ovaries and nutritive canals. These crustaceans appeared to
devour with avidity all the coloured parts of their hosts, and I
think it was probably due to the ever-increasing numbers of these
parasites that the size of the individuals composing the incoming
generations of Aurelia continued to become more and more
diminutive. I shall, however, attend to all these points more
closely next year, after which I shall doubtless be able to speak
with more certainty regarding them.

sphere has been notably thinner than usual, and the granulations
smaller and less numerous, rendering more conspicuous the
light-grey coloured back-ground between the granules. The
veiled spots are seen through the chromosphere that is spread
over them like a veil; they are, like ordinary spots, true openings
of the photosphere; they are scattered throughout all latitudes,
though more complicated in regions where the ordinary spots
make their appearance. Mr. Trouvelot has observed spots at
least within 10 degrees of the north pole of the sun (very few of
the ordinary spots have hitherto been observed beyond 40).—
Prof. Kimball describes an ingenious arrangement by which he
demonstrates that the law affirming the coefficient of friction on
an inclined plane to be constant for all velocities, is not strictly
true. The sliding box had a cover 6 feet long, with strips of
smoked glass upon it, on which a tuning fork, fixed above to an
independent support, traced a wave-line as the box slid down,
thus giving a perfect autographic register of the experiment.—A
new method of measuring the velocity of electricity is described
by Prof. Lovering. He avails himself of Lissajous' method of
compounding the rectangular vibrations of two tuning forks, the
reflected beam entering a telescope. The forks being maintained
in vibration by electro-magnets and brought into unison, the
resultant orbit seen in the telescope is invariable. A length of
resistance coil is introduced sufficient to change the orbit to some
other in the series, and this change reveals the amount of retard-

a rule that unpublished observations should be deemed scientifi-
cally useless. As to congresses, he does not think that they
should be occupied with discussions on the laws of meteorology.
The derivation of laws from observations should be looked lor
in the undisturbed thoughtfulness of individuals. Experience
shows, however, that private persons do not employ themselves
as much as formerly in working out observations, and it seems
to be absolutely necessary for the advancement of meteorology
that every official observer should be given sufficient time, beyond
that required for mechanical work, for developing the science as
far as his powers will permit, and that the central institutions
should be adequately endowed for this purpose.—The next paper
is a review, by Dr. Hann, of the publications of Messrs. Fjord
and Paul la Cour on the climate of Denmark, which contain very
valuable statistics in the decennial means of fourteen stations. As
in other similarly situated countries, both the heat of summer and
the cold of winter are more intense inland than on the coasts, and
in July the most easterly stations are the warmest. The mild
weather of spring seems to advance from S.W. toN.E., and
the cool weather of October from N. \V. to S. E. Thus the mean

23rd and 24th of October. The mean monthly range of tem-
perature is greatest in May, least in January; from April to
August the maxima rise higher above the monthly mean than the
minima sink below it; from September to March the relation is
converse. The absolute maximum range was registered in July,
the absolute minimum in November. The average number of
days on which frost occurs is ninety-two ; lime of maximum rain-
fall the latter end of August and beginning of September; of
minimum, the beginning of April. Yearly mean rainfall—in
Denmark, 604 mm. ; on the west coast of Jutland, 670 mm. ; at
Copenhagen, 587 mm. ; Bomholm, 580 mm.. A small table in-

on which rain fell, and on which thunderstorms, hailstorms, fog,
and cloud occurred. January is the cloudiest, May and July are the
least cloudy of months. Tables showing tie frequency per cent,

results of his inquiries into the distribution of thunderstorms in

western coast of the Baltic, sixteen; and on the coast of the
North Sea, fifteen. Inland, the number averages twenty. They
increase in number with increasing altitude, up to about 1,400 m.,
then decrease rapidly. Winter thunderstorms are much more
common in Northern Germany than in Austria and Hungary.

Magnetic Rotation." By W. Spottiswoode, M.A., Treas. and
V.P.R.S.
The phenomena of the rotation of movable conductors, carry-
ing currents, about lines of magnetic force, are well known.
One form of experiment, commonly called the rotating spark,
presents, beside the actual rotation, some peculiar features
which do not appear to have been noticed in detail.
The spark, when carefully observed, is seen to assume a spiral
form ; and the spiral is right-handed or left-handed according to
both the direction of the current and the magnetic polarity.
This effect is particularly noticeable if the magnetic pole be in-
serted only a short distance beyond the ring. The discharge is

Titration which strikes nearly in a straight line between the
erminals. This opens a path for a continuous discharge, which
>eing nearly in a condition of equilibrium, though an untranslat-
ihle one, remains a short time without much change of place.
Tnen it moves rapidly to its position of equilibrium, the surface
which is its locus forming the sheet. Then it remains in its
position of equilibrium during the greater part of the discharge,
approaching the axis again as the discharge falls, so that its
Equilibrium position is not so far from the axis. Thus we see
two"bright curves corresponding to the two positions of approxi-
mate rest united by a less bright sheet, the first curve being
nearly a straight line, and the second nearly a helix traced on a
cylinder of which the former line is a generating line.
"It was noticed that the sheet projected a little beyond the
helix. This may be explained by considering that at first the
discharge is more powerful than can be maintained, so that the
curve reaches a little beyond the distance that can be main-
tained."
The appearance of the discharge when viewed in a revolving
mirror (except the projection beyond the sheet, the illumina-
tion of which was too feeble to be observed) confirmed the above

"SCIENTIFIC WORTHIES"
VII.—Sir Charles Wheatstone, Born February
1802, Died October 19, 1875
CHARLES WHEATSTONE was the son of a music-
seller at Gloucester, where he was born in February
1802, and was educated at a private school in that city.
His father afterwards came to London, where he became a
teacher of the flute. He had, we bel'eve, some share in
the musical education of the Princess Charlotte, a fact of
which he was never tired of boasting. In 1823 young
Wheatstone removed to London and commenced business
as a musical instrument maker, and in the same year made
what was probably his first contribution to scientific lite-
rature in a paper entitled " New Experiments on Sound,"
contributed to Thomson's "Annals of Philosophy." In
1827 he contributed to the Quarterly Journal of Science
an account of " Experiments on Audition," and a descrip-
tion of the beautiful toy known as the Kaleidophone. In
1332 he read an important paper to the Royal Society,
"On the Acoustic Figures of Vibrating Surfaces." In
this memoir the author gave for the first time the laws
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
of formation of the varied and beautiful figures dis-
covered by Chladni. He continued for several years to
devote his attention to Sound, and subsequently to Light.
He was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in
King's College, London, in 1834, and in the same year
made his celebrated experiments on the velocity of an
electric discharge by the aid of revolving mirrors.
Wheatstone does not stem to have lectured regularly at
King's College, and many of his discoveries were
described to the world by Faraday at the Royal Institu-
tion. Indeed he was not well adapted for public lecturing;
he was so nervous that even in a very small company he
usually sat silent. Though his discoveries have become
of such immense practical importance, Wheatstone him-
self was far from being a practical business man; on this
account he often failed to reap the substantial fruit
of his discoveries. Wheatstone was married on Feb. 12,
1847.
Wheatstone's name is intimately connected with the
early history of Spectrum Analysis. In a paper read in
1835, "On the Prismatic Analysis of Electric Light" at
the Dublin meeting of the British Association, he an-
nounced the existence of rays of definite refrangibility,
emitted in the volatilisation of metals by the electric
spark. He showed that the spectrum of the electric spark
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
from different metals presented each a definite series of
lines differing in colour and position from each other, and
that these appearances afforded the means of distinguish-
ing the smallest fragment of one metal from that of
another. "We have here," he wrote, "a mode of dis-
criminating metallic bodies more readily than that of
chemical examination, and which may hereafter be em-
ployed for useful purposes." These last words furnish
the keynote to all Wheatstone's work; however valuable
may be the services he has rendered to pure science, his
great ultimate aim was the useful and practical. It was at
Vol. xiil—No. 339
the meeting of the British Association in 1838 that he
described and exhibited the newly-invented stereoscope,
and at the 1848 meeting he described his "polar clock,"
an instrument for ascertaining the time by means of the
change in the plane of polarisation of the light of the
sky in the direction of the pole. One of these instruments,
we believe, has been sent out with the Arctic Expedition.
Wheatstone's description of the rheostat, and of the well-
known " bridge" which bears his name, is printed in the

possesses, is, without any doubt, Mr. Wheatstone. This
illustrious philosopher was led to this beautiful result by
the researches that he had made in 1834 upon the velocity
of electricity—researches in which he had employed insu-
lated wires of several miles in length, and which had
demonstrated to him the possibility of making voltaic
and magneto-electric currents pass through circuits of
this length. It was in 1837, in the month of June, that
Mr. Wheatstone took out his first patent. He first em-
ployed five conducting-wires, between two distant stations,
acting upon five magnetised needles, the movements of
which, being combined two and two, were enabled to pro-
duce several different signs. Mr. Wheatstone, at this time,
entered into partnership with Mr. Cooke, who had like-
wise devised an ingenious telegraphic apparatus founded
upon the same principles. The English philosophers,
from the very first, had added to the telegraph—properly
so called—an apparatus intended to call the attention of
the observers, and designated under the name of Alarm.
. . . The principle upon which this alarm is founded
includes an immense number of applications, for it enables

man to put in action—at any distance whatever—all the
forces of mechanics, in an instantaneous manner. Indeed,
more recently. Mr. Wheatstone applied it to the construc-
tion of his dial telegraph; and it is the same principle
which serves as the basis of Morse's telegraph, invented
at nearly the same period."—De la Rive, Part VII.
Chap. I.
We may repeat here a fact which does not appear
to be generally known or recognised, that Wheatstone
was the first suggester and worker at submarine tele-
graphy. From documents before us we learn that so
early as 1837 he was thinking much on and was greatly
interested in the subject; and in February, 1840, he stated
his opinion before a Select Committee of the House of
Commons as to the practicability of establishing electric
communication by means of a cable between Dover and
Calais.
Wheatstone's applications of electricity were almost
innumerable. His electric clocks are well known ; various
electric registers were invented by him, one especially for
recording a variety of meteorological data, and another,
which acts as a chronoscope to register the velocity of a
bullet. Indeed, his ingenuity was marvellous, and, as we
have already hinted, there are doubtless many useful in-
ventions due to him, of which he has reaped neither
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the profit nor the credit.
Wheatstone received many "honours" during his life-
time. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in
1836, in 1868 he was knighted, in 1873 he was elected a
foreign member of the Paris Academy, and had altogether
upwards of thirty foreign distinctions. The following
estimate of Wheatstone and of his contributions to
science is from the pen of Signor Paul Volpicelli, the
distinguished Italian electrician.
The Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France,
at its stance of October 18, 1875, was informed by
the perpetua1 secretary, M. Dumas, that the illustrious
English physicist, Charles Wheatstone, was seriously ill
in Paris at tne Hotel du Louvre. By the 17th of the
month, however, fears for the safety of that savant were
well nigh vanished, and it was believed that he would
soon be completely restored to health. The hope un-
happily proved fallacious; an aggravation having occurred
in the pneumonitis, which was thought to have been
overcome, carried off that distinguished physicist on the
19th of the month from his friends and from science.

To remove this difficulty, Wheatstone invented a very
ingenious apparatus, by which the vibratory motions of
the luminiferous ether could be represented with consider-
able fidelity, and especially the phenomena of polarisa-
tion, whether rectilinear, circular, or elliptic.
Many were the achievements realised by Wheatstone
in applying himself to optics: we owe to him the inven-
tion of a kaleidoscope, in which the persistence of im-
pressions on the retina was utilised in demonstrating the
transversal vibrations of an elastic rod fixed at one of its
extremities; we owe to him one of the most sensitive
photometers, as also the way of estimating the duration of
lamps, the movements of the sea, and the ramifications of
the retina; the difference between the solar and the electric
light, and the lines of the light obtained from combustion
of bodies brought to the poles of the voltaic battery. He
was, further, the inventor of the polar clock, an instru-
ment designed to indicate the hours through observation
of the plane of polarisation of light of the blue sky in the
region of the North Pole. That instrument, improved by
Soleil, was marvellously adapted for finding the neutral

points of Arago, Babinet, and Brewster.
The science of acoustics also profited by the valuable
researches of our Lincean correspondent, for he experi-
mented on sound and on hearing, devised his kaleido-
phone, occupied himself with resonance or reciprocal
vibrations produced by a column of air; he also studied
the transmission of musical sounds, and the figures ob-
tained with sand on a vibrating surface, or acoustic
figures.
Moreover, he cultivated, with great advantage to science,
electro-dynamics; and devised two rheostats, one for great,
the other for small resistances.
We are indebted to the illustrious deceased for many
other scientific contributions, which have realised a
notable progress in various branches of modern physics,
and especially in telegraphy. Among these contributions,
which time would fail fully to enumerate, we must not
omit to speak of the method, so fruitful of valuable con-
sequences, by which Wheatstone determined the velocity
of the electric discharge in a metallic wire.
He was likewise skilled and practised in ballistics ; and
he employed the uniform rotation of two pasteboard discs,
fixed on a common horizontal axis passing through their
centres, to ascertain the initial velocity of a projectile
fired from a gun. The projectile, traversing with uniform
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
velocity these rotating discs, produced within two holes,
the different situations of which afforded a means of
determining the initial velocity of the ball.
Wheatstone was the first to employ the rapid rotation of
a reflecting disc for measuring the velocity of propaga-
tion of an imponderable agent, without resorting to great
distances, such as the planetary. After having in vain
turned the spark-exciting organ round an axis, hoping to
be able to increase the extent of sparks, and also to alter
their direction, according to the direction of turning, he
conceived the idea of communicating to a reflecting disc
or plane mirror a very rapid rotatory action, by which the
electric spark produced at a certain distance from the
disc might be reflected.
The interesting consequences derived from these expe-
riments are—(1) that electricity takes an appreciable time
in traversing a distance, whence may be inferred approxi-
mately the velocity of the electric current; (2) that this
velocity does not depend on the direction of the electric
current; (3) that of three sparks, reflected by this means,
in the same horizontal direction, the two lateral ones

retarded the arrangements. The Russian contributions

interesting character.

The nature and value of the handbooks for the various

Maskelyne, Carey Foster, Guthrie, Clements Markbam,
Lockyer, and others. The entire work, extending to some
300 pages, in which the history and functions of the several
instruments are dealt with, will be expounded in a clear
and succinct manner.

those corridors and inspect the various objects encased
on either hand, without soon beginning to marvel at the
multiplicity and complexity of the tools which science has

come to construct for herself in the progress of her in-
quiries; and at the degree of precision and skill to which
she has at length attained, after many a tentative and
faltering step towards the end in view. Yet it may truly
be said, that as the branches and divisions of science
multiply in increasing ratio, and therewith also the appara-
tuses become more and more complicated, the investigator,
acquiring a deeper insight and wider range, ere long
perceives a unity where he had not previously imagined
it, and finds that many things which had seemed to be so
many disjecta membra are knit together in the closest in-
terrelations. It is perhaps not among the least benefits
accruing from an exhibition like the present, that scientific
men are enabled to survey, in close juxtaposition with
their own line of research, other lines which they may
have given little heed to, or but imperfectly compre-
hended. To an outsider also, who appreciates the keen
enjoyment of scientific tastes, and is not hopelessly devoted
to a hobby, the comparison cannot fail to be pleasant and
instructive.
Again, that progress of science just referred to, from the
less perfect to the more perfect, from the rough and
clumsy to the finished and refined, in the construction of
her instruments, affords a retrospect that is fascinatingly
instructive. In the inspection of the collection one comes

plain proportions and great simplicity, which almost seems
as though it had stumbled by mistake into the company of
its elegant and brightly furbished conquerors—had come
among a generation that knew it not. Yet these ancient
relics have a deeply interesting history, and they will
doubtless attract to themselves no small share of
attention from the visitors who will take advantage, we
trust, in large numbers, of the unique opportunities this
exhibition affords. Nor would any contempt which
might momentarily arise for the unpretentious and un-
couth figure of these instruments be long in giving place
to a sort of veneration and awe, for the story they have
to tell that they took shape under the hand or at
least under the thoughtful direction of a Galileo or
a Herschel.
The general arrangement of the exhibition, which, as
already mentioned, is by no means complete yet, may
here be briefly indicated. The space occupied is in the
West and South Courts. After passing through the

measuring the bore of guns, differences of one-ten-thou-

moreover, by means of which a quantity so minute as one-
millionth can be grasped. The apparatuses which Joule
employed in ascertaining the mechanical equivalent of
heat, are among the collection.
The field of magnetism and electricity is now a very
vast one, and in the exhibition it is represented by a cor-

of interest gathers round the instruments, many of them
so simple and homely, with which Faraday worked out his

also the novel forms of magneto-electric and other

of continuous electric currents; apparatus for measuring
the strength of electric currents, and apparatus for mea-
suring resistance, and so on. In the telegraphic depart-
ment there is a complete historical collection which must
be of great interest not only to electricians and tele-
graphists, but to the general public, illustrating the
progress of the electric telegraph from the time when
the first idea of it was crudely embodied, down to
the present time. This collection includes, of course,
all the classical apparatus which belonged to Wheat-
stone and Cooke, among which is the original
Wheatstone Bridge. Many will be interested in seeing

has exercised a very wise discretion. In these final
chapters the reader will find an excellent summary of the
latest contributions to Cosmogony, and a generally fair
and impartial discussion of the bearing and value of
recent geological theories.
Of the suitability of Prof. Green's work as a text-book
for "students," we regret to say that we cannot speak so
favourably. The ability and enthusiasm with which our
author writes on certain portions of his subject, fail to
reconcile us to his inadequate treatment and sometimes
total neglect of others of equal importance; and, in
perusing the book, it is impossible to avoid the feeling
that the space devoted to the several subdivisions of the
science must have been determined, not as the result of a
judicial consideration of their respective claims, but
almost entirely by the author's peculiar predilections. For
example, it is rather startling to find in ajwork on Physical
Geology, extending to 540 pages, no discussion what-
ever of the phenomena and origin of mineral veins, and
only, indeed, an incidental mention of their existence!

as a student's manual, is the looseness of description and
inaccuracy of language in certain parts of it. This defect
is most conspicuous in the second chapter, which treats
of the characters and classification of rocks, and which
offers a painful contrast to those later chapters of which
we have already spoken. Among the numerous grave
errors which every petrologist will remark in this chap-
ter, we may call attention to the following. In the enu-
meration of the principal crystallographic forms the
author omits such commonly occurring ones as the penta-
gonal-dodecahedron, the icositetrahedron, the scalenohe-
dron, and the tetrahedron, although some of these have
to be referred to in subsequent pages of the work; of the
hemihctiral forms, indeed, Prof. Green makes no mention
whatever. We are told that when a piece of calc-spar is
broken up, "the shape of the fragments will be identically
that of the block we started with." Again, we read, in refer-
ence to the subject of Polymorphism, "This is spoken of
as Dimorphism, when the different crystalline shapes are
two in number; Trimorphism when they are three in
number, and so on." The italics are our own. In speak-
ing of the constituents of a rock, the author places side
by side metals and oxides in the loosest manner, and
while the formula of soda is written Na20, that of potash
stands as KO. Olivine is classed as a mineral of the

augite group, and we read, " It is said that augite has
never yet been found with quartz or orthoclase." "Per-
lite" is confounded with "sphaerulite," certain rocks are
spoken of as acidic, trachytes are classified as quarizless
and quartzose, and no mention is made of the fact that
nepheline is a usual and highly important, if not an invari-
able, constituent of phonolites. These and many similar
errors convince us that Prof. Green has hardly taken that
amount of care in mastering those principles of chemis-
try, mineralogy, and petrology which are indispensable to
the presentation of this part of his subject in a manner
that will be of real service to the student. And this conclu-
sion is confirmed when we examine the classification of
rocks adopted by the author, and many of his definitions,
such as those of rhyolite, hypersthene rock, and leucite-
rock; or again, when we mark the want of judgment so
frequently shown by him, as, for example, in rejecting the
name of "porphyrite," while he retains that of "ipk-
nite." Of the little care that has been taken to bring

DITTMAR'S CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
A Manual of Qualitative Chemical Analysis. By
William Dittmar, Professor of Chemistry in Ander-
son's University, Glasgow. (Edinburgh: Edmon-
ston and Douglas, 1876.)
WITH the numerous works on chemical analysis already
in existence we are justified in asking what special
advantages Prof. Dittmar has to offer to chemical students
in bringing out another book on the same subject. It will
be found, in answer to this question, that the present
work contrasts favourably with many of our standard
books on the subject both as regards completeness, ori-
ginality of treatment, and the introduction of a large
amount of important matter which has not hitherto found
its way into our manuals of analysis.
In giving our readers a brief sketch of Prof. Dittmar's
mode of treatment, we shall point nut what appear to us
to be the special features in the new analysis deserving
commendation.
To quote from the "Introduction" :— "The book is
intended for the use of students who, after they have
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
mastered the first rudiments of chemistry, enter a labo-
ratory to work under the diieclion of a teacher, while, at
the same time, they continue their study of theoretical
chemistry."
Following the Introduction, we have a series of exer-
cises calculated to make the student practically acquainted
with most of the operations and processes employed in
anal) sis. Among the readable matter interspersed be-
tween the exercises, we notice with satisfaction a clear
elucidation of the meaning of the term equivalent—a
term which appears to have dropped out of most of the
modern text-books, leading students to believe (we speak
from actual experience) cither that the idea is altogether
obsolete or is coveicd in some mysterious way by the
word " atomicity."
We are of opinion that the meaning of "equivalent,"
or "equivalent weight" of an element, should be laid
before all students of the science and the relationship of
these numbers to the " atomic weights" clearly pointed
out. In this same portion of the book will be found also
an excellent exposition of the general theory 01 double
decomposition.
The next division treats of the metals, these being
divided into six groups, viz., the copper group, comprising
silver, mercury, lead, copper, bismuth, cadmium (and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
palladium); the arsenic group, comprising this metal,
antimony, tin (molybdenum, tungsten, gold, platinum, and
the platinum metals other than palladium); the iron
group comprising chromium, aluminium, iron (uranium),
cobalt, nickel, manganese, zinc (thallium), &c.; the
barium group comprising this metal, strontium, and
calcium; the magnesium group consisting of this metal
and lithium ; and the potassium group comprising sodium,
potassium (rubidium and caesium). The method here
adopted does not much differ from that in general use,
excepting that the groups are considered in the same
order as that followed in the systematic course of analysis
instead of in the inverse order. After the reactions of
each of the metals in the group have been considered,
their separation from each other and from the other
groups is entered upon. We are glad to sec that in many
cases the author does not limit himself to one particular
method of separation, but gives the most effective methods
krjown, and points out under what particular conditions
each process is applicable. The reactions of the rarer
metals are given in appendices to the main groups. We

the author contents himself with a few general remarks,
leaving it to the student to ajply the methods acquired
in working through the foregoing portions of the book,
instead of guiding him, or, we should rather say, binding
him down to the usual "tables."
It would be invidious on our part to institute compari-
sons between the present and any existing work on the
same subject; but, considering the volume as the expres-
sion of the method taught by Prof. Dittmar, we are of
opinion that it stands on a decidedly higher level than
the gtnerality of such works.
Although the author's accuracy is throughout unim-
peachable, there are some few questionable, or at least
debateable points, which demand a passing notice.
In the first place, we regret to see the occasional ap-
pearance of what we must consider badly-constructed
phrases such as the following (p. 44):—" To students
who have not yet got far enough advanced to invent their
own methods." Then, again, we haidly know whether to
admire or to condemn the frequent inconsistencies of
formulation. To give a few examples :—Phosphoric acid
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
is written in different parts of the book in no less than
four different ways: thus, at p. 11, HHHPO,; p. 253,
PO(OH;3; p. 244, P2Os. 3H20 =- aPr^O,; at pp. 244-
245, the metallic phosphates are written PC^HR'j,
P04H2R', and P04R'3, and on the same page metaphos-
phoric acid is written HP03. Then on the same page
(41) we find two nitrates thus formulated: HgON205
and Bi(NOj)3. Now, although we admire the spirit
which leads a writer to adopt these different modes of
formulation as being a spirit of independence, which in
the original worker shows that he is not the slave of
any hypothesis, we think that the case is entirely altered
when we have to deal with students of the science,
nothing shaking the faith of a learner so much as an
apparent want of consistency.
We cannot conceive why the author has gone back to
the old nomenclature—" nitrate of potash," "bisulphate of
potash," " phosphate of soda," &c. Although consistency
is displayed throughout the book in this matter we cannot
sanction the use of a system of nomenclature which, if
not entirely obsolete, is rapidly becoming so amon^ the
scientific chemists in this country. Be it understood that
our protest is here again entered solely from a student's
point of view. It must perplex the learner to find out
that the substances he has been employing in Prof.

Dittmar's laboratory under the names of "bisulphate of

as " potassic disulphate," "hydric potassic sulphate," or
"hydrogen potassium sulphate," "hydric disodic phos-
phate," or "hydrogen disodium phosphate," &c.
With these remarks we may conclude our notice of
what we venture to look upon as a valuable addition to
our literature of the important subject of chemical
analysis. We are confident that Prof. Dittmar's work
will stand, by virtue of its own merits, as a scheme for
instructing in this branch of the science.
We have in these columns (vol. xi. p. 107) formerly ex-
pressed the opinion that the systems of analysis in general
use in our schools of chemistry need reforming in certain
particulars. Thus in the article referred to we found
occasion to complain of the want of chemical science dis-
played by the majority of students practising analysis
according to certain cut and dried systems of '' tables
It must be conceded that the student who is thoroughly
well grounded in the scientific principles involved is

by the time they had reached its top, we had mounted the
third. In such a competition as this the increasing diffi-
culty of respiration soon warns a man to stop, but in the
life-long struggle for existence it is not so easy for one to
know when he is getting out of breath and to relax his exer-
tions in time. As a help to do this Dr. Richardson's work is
most valuable, for he paints in vivid colours the symptoms
of disease from worry and mental strain, beginning with
the slighter ones of restlessness, irritability, and " an over-
weening desire to do more and yet more work," and end-
ing with dementia, diabetes, &c. He gives a most salu-
tary warning to those who strive to counteract the effects
of mental overwork by adding to it hard bodily exercise,
and his remarks on physical strain should be carefully
perused by all young athletes. If his cautions were con-
stantly attended to, we would have fewer instances of
break-down either mental or physical. The effects of the
passions on the body are next taken up, and then the
action of alcohol and tobacco discussed at length.
Dr. •Richardson seems to regard alcohol as an unmiti-
gated evil, and although he acknowledges that sometimes
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
tobacco may be useful in soothing the excited brain, he
omits this beneficial action from the summary which he
gives of the effects of smoking, and includes only the
baneful effects which follow the abuse of the weed. This
part of his book recalls to our mind a lecture in which
the late Prof. Hughes Bennett denounced pastry as one
of the chief causes of consumption. No one can doubt
that pastry, alcohol, and tobacco are all capable of abuse,
but whether their use is to be entirely prohibited on that
account is an entirely different question.
The chapters on disease from the use of narcotics, and
from late hours and broken sleep are especially interest-
ing and instructive; and that on disease from food con-
tains some most useful remarks on the injurious effects of
too much tea, coffee, soda-water, seltzer, and sweets, as
well as on the consequences of over-eating.
In treating of diseases from impurity of air the author
mentions the bad effects of stoves, but he might also with
advantage have drawn attention to the languor and
inability to work which may be induced by burning much
gas in the room where one is thinking or writing. He
might have mentioned the Italian proverb, that when you
have built a house you should make your enemy live in it
for the first year, your friend for the second, and should
inhabit it yourself in the third; but his observation of the

occurrence of eight cases of consumption and fourteen of
rheumatic fever in one row of pretty houses during the
first two years after they were built may perhaps convince
people of the danger of inhabiting damp dwellings, with-
out any additional testimony.
Other chapters deal with diseases incident to some occu-
pations, disease from sloth and idleness, from errors of
dress, from imitation and moral contagion, automatic
disease and hypochondriasis, and intermarriage of dis-
ease. The book concludes with a summary of practical
applications or short directions how to avoid or counteract
the sources of disease already discussed.
The work is of great value as a practical guide to enable
the readers to detect and avoid various sources of disease,
and it contains in addition several introductory chapters on
natural life and natural death, the phenomena of disease,
disease antecedent to birth, and on the effects of the sea-
sons, of atmospheric temperature, of atmospheric pressure,
of moisture, winds, and atmospheric chemical changes,
which are of great general interest. In several points we
do not agree with Dr. Richardson; we would like him

curious fishes of the most brilliant and varied hues.
The huye rounded bosses of green growing coral among which

The scales and half scales were here in a most perfect state, and

Floating Radiometers
In Mr. Crookes' paper reported in Nature, vol. xiii. p. 489,
occur the following words: "The envelope turned very slowly
a few degiees in one direction, then stopped and turned a few
degrees the opposite way." Assuming that this is rightly re-
ported, it is inexplicable to me how Mr. Crookes could have
written it. For, as the lawyers say, it is "void from ambiguity."
The whole question between Mr. Crookes and Dr. Schuster
appears to me to turn on the one point ignored by the former.
When the rotation of the envelope began, in which direction
was the first oscillation? To say that the envelope first turned
in one direction and then in the other is simply to say that
it oscillated, which, while it is a shorter mode of expressing
the same thing, is an equally useless expression. The very nerve
of the pioblem lies in the point omitted. If the first oscillation
of the envelope was in the direction opposite to that of the mill,
it is surely incontestable that the kick, which caused it, could
not be the effect of any external force acting on the discs only.

Prof. Fleeming Jenkin's text-book on'' Electricity and Magnetism"

On the Nature of Musical Pipes having a Propulsive
Mode of Action
In the concluding paragraph of my last paper (Nature, vol.
xii., p. 146), I brought under notice the remarkable difference in
the effect of increased diameter upon the two great classes of
pipes, regarded by me as referable to the fact of the mass of air
in the pipe being in the one class (that of pipes with reeds of
wood or metal) under the influence of a propulsive current, and

512

class is three-fourtlis of the half-wave length, and then in accord-
ance with varying diameters above stated all larger diameters
demand length to be increased in ratio, and more allowance to
be made for the diverging than for the uniform bore ; greater or
less amount of wind, and greater or less degree of pressure also
enter into calculation, and practically are convertible in effect,
the one doing duty for the other.
In the distinctive mode of action of this class we may find
reasons for the varying relations of the pipes to each other, and
for the contrasts shown in comparison with the other class acting
under its own peculiar mode. In these propulsive pipes in both
the wide and narrow scales, the wind-current, after entering the
foot of the pipe or boot, passes into the body of the pipe by a
very contracted inlet formed by a hollow plug usually of metal
called "the beak," or more commonly "the reed," to the con-
fusion of inquirers; properly named, as we see it in old authors,
it is "the shallot," from its resemblance in shape to the once
favourite esculent the eschallot; ordinarily we speak of "the
tongue" the elastic strip of metal covering it, as "the reed,"
for in the clarionet this part is really a reed. The main impulse
of the current passes into the cone of the pipe through the mass

of air in a central direction, and thus in a wide pipe, as com-
pared with its course in a narrow pipe, the current has exchanged
the friction upon the sides for the lesser fric'ion of air upon air,
still restricted, but less so in degree as the cone expands, as of a
swift river escaping the confinement of banks, flooding the quiet
expanding delta, agitating its waters with gradually-decreasing
strength, and then becoming diffused in surrounding ocean.
Utmost exactness in length is quite as important lor pitch and
tone in these as in flue-pipes. Although the reed tongue has
a determinate pitch of itself, yet a proper length of tube to
reciprocate its action is indispensable, any inaccuracy only "up-
sets the tone," as the technical phrase says, and gives rise to
curious freaks of behaviour. The slim tapering obje is so sen-
sitive that if we make it a quarter of an inch too long, or if we
merely pat the top of its bell whilst sounding, the tone will im-
mediately leap to its third above—not to a harmonic—a problem
as puzzling as that of some echoes falling successively by thirds.
The action of the air-reed as causing suction by the velocity of
passage of wind over the mouth was illustrated by me in a pre-
vious paper by reference to the abstracting power of a current of
air, as shown in the spray-diffuser where globules of liquid are
lifted and withdrawn by its agency. The action in these beating
reeds is also susceptible of as simple an illustration. Take six or
eight feet of india rubber tubing of \-inch bore, for this length
defines action more clearly—coil the length round your hand,

and placing O le end in the mouth blow through the tube sharply,
at the same time allow the tip of your tongue freedom of play
near the orifice, and you will find it drawn suddenly to the tube
by the suction of the current passing down it, and released only
on the exit of the current into the atmosphere. Lightly press-
ing the coil in your hand you may likewise feel the throb of the
passing air-pulse. The trombone-player is conscious of his lip
being forcibly drawn into the cup by a like cause. A stream of
air suddenly cut off cannot pass down a tube without leaving a
vacuum behind it. Organ and orchestral trumpets and oboes,
and all of like propulsive action, are subject to this power, and
only through it are able to generate tones. Suction is thus seen
to be the final cause of vibration, the vacuum exists until the
initial pulse of the vibration has made exit at the outer orifice,
or in the second and succeeding courses until the pulses reach
the colliding point or place of the prime node. Always thus in
every musical pipe the current is essential to the suction, but with
the striking difference that in the Hue-pipe there is continuity of
stream, and the continuity of flow is made available by conver-
sion in reciprocating motion, but in the propulsive class the
action is effective through discontinuity, by abrupt cessations

the greater number of revolutions will the samara perform ere
reaching the ground, and the longer consequently will be the
path through which its friction is exercised.
In seeking a model for a screw-propeller, we must remember
that the pitch should vary with the velocity of propulsion.

The Rotation of Venus.—It was Jean Dominique
Cassini (Cassini I. as he has frequently been designated)
who during his residence in Italy, made the first serious
attempt to ascertain the time of rotation of this planet
and the position of the axis. His observations with one
of Campani's long telescopes appear to have been com-
menced about the middle of the seventeenth century, as
related in the Journal des Savans, 1667, Dec. 12, but it
¦was not until the evening of Oct. 14, 1666, that he per-
ceived any spot of sufficiently definite aspect to be of
service for the purpose in view. It is described as " Une
partie claire situde proche de la section, et fort dloignde
du centre de cette planete vers le septentrion." At the
same time several dusky spots were noted. These obser-

vations were continued tilljune i667,but Cassini expressed
himself very cautiously with regard to the inferences to
be drawn from them. They appeared to indicate a
return of the bright spots to the same position upon the
disc at intervals of about twenty-three hours, but from
the short time that the spots could be followed Cassini
was unable to decide whether the appearances were to be
attributed to an axial rotation or to a libration. "De
dire maintenant," he says, " suppose" que ce soit toujours
la meme partie luisante, si ce mouvement se fait par une
libration, e'est ce que jc n'oserais encore assurer, parce
que je n'ai pas pu voir la continuity de ce mouvement dans
une grande partie de Tare, comme dans les autres planetes,
et par cette meme raison cela sera toujours tres-difficile
a determiner."
In 1726 Bianchini, domestic prelate of the Pope, ob-
serving at Rome, with glasses, also by Campani, of 70 to
100 Roman palms in focus, remarked on Feb. 9 several
spots which he continued to observe with the view to
determine the time of rotation. His observations were pub-
lished in " Hesperi et Phosphori nova Phenomena," 1728,
and he considered them to show a period of rotation of 24
days 8 hours, the North pole of Venus being directed to
longitude 320°, with an inclination of 15° only to the plane
of the ecliptic. Bianchmi's observations appear to have
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
been made under very unfavourable conditions, whereby
he was prevented from following the spots in a continuous
manner. They were discussed at length by Jacques
Cassini, the son of Jean Dominique, in '' Llemens
d'Astronomie" (1740), who arrived at the conclusion that
a rotation of 23 hours 20 minutes would represent equally
well his father's observations and those of Bianchini,
while if the rotation assigned by the latter was admitted,
it would be necessary to reject entirely the observations
of the elder Cassini, "comme n'etant qu'une apparence
trompeuse."
Jacques Cassini mentions that after Bianchini had
commuuica'ed to him the observations at Rome, he
made attempts to discern the spots upon Venus at Paris.
He examined the planet on a great number of occasions
with a glass of 114 feet focus, one of the best produced
by Hartsoeker, and also with one of Campani's, of 120
Roman palms' focus, which had been tried by Bianchini
and considered excellent, but with all the precautions
taken neither he nor Maraldi could perceive any distinct
spot upon the planet's disc.

remarkable for the exceedingly small size of the brain
cavity, compared with the arches and ridges of the skull de-
veloped for muscular attachments. This character has been
supposed to indicate marsupial affinities, but the rest of
the osteology, as far as known, does not favour this view.
The lower jaw has not been found, but the cranium shows
the full complement of teeth so frequent in Eocene
mammals. There are three broad tubercular molars
behind the trihedral sectorial, which indicate that the
animal was rather omnivorous than truly carnivorous
in its habits. Another genus which includes many
species of various size, and having a wide geo-
graphical range, being found in late Eocene and early
Miocene deposits in France, Germany, England, and
North America, is called Hyanodon. It also has been by
many Daturalists placed among the marsupials on account
of the peculiarities of its dentition, which is certainly
without parallel among placental Carnivores. It possesses
the primitive or typical dental formula of the Eocene
mammals, and the incisors, canines, and premolars, are
not unlike those of a dog, but the three true molars, both

above and below, are shaped like the sectorial teeth of a
cat or hyaena, and increase in size from the first to the
last, and thus there are no teeth formed like the " tuber-
culars " of ordinary Carnivores. This repetition of the secto-
rial character in the true molars occurs in the carnivorous
marsupials, though the general structure of the skull, and
limb bones as far as they are known, including the posi-
tion of the lachrymal canal within the orbit, will not permit
our placing Hyanodon in that group. Many of the lately
discovered American Eocene carnivores presented the same
peculiarity of several successive molars having sectorial
characters. One of these from Wyoming, apparently
allied to Hyasnodon, has been described by Cope, under
the name of Mesonyx, and another still more aberrant
form, as Synoplotherium. The inferior canines project
forwards, and are closely approximated, the incisors (at
all events in the aged specimen on which the genus was
founded) being absent. The molar teeth were so much
worn that their characters cannot be satisfactorily made
out. The most interesting features of these animals are
in the structure of the feet, the ungual phalanges being
flatter and broader than in any existing Carnivora, and
grooved above, and the scaphoid and lunar bones of the
carpus not being united as in all existing Carnivore'.
These naturally lead to the consideration of some ani-

same locality and formation, of such anomalous construc-
tion, that they cannot be placed in any of the known
groups, and for which Prof. Marsh has constituted the
order Tillodontia. The type of the order Tillolhcrium,
Marsh, is described as having a skull with the same
general shape as in the bears, but in its structure resem-.
bling that of Ungulates. The molar teeth are of the
Ungulate type, the canines are small, and in each jaw
there is a pair of large scalpriform incisors faced with
enamel, and growing from persistent pulps, as in Rodents.
The adult dentition is i - c l- p 2 m 1. The articulation
2 ia 3
of the lower jaw with the skull corresponds to that in
Ungulates. The brain was small and somewhat convoluted.
The skeleton most resembles that of Carnivores, especially
the Ursida, but the scaphoid and lunar bones are not
united, and there is a third trochanter on the femur. The
radius and ulna, and the tibia and fibula, are distinct.
The feet are plantigrade, and each had five digits, all
terminated by long, compressed and pointed ungual

NATURE
On passing to the internal organs, and the mode of
development, we find far greater points of resemblance;
as to the latter, in fact, the correspondence is wonderful,
the account given of the development of a reptile (Nature,
vol. xiii., p. 429), applying in every respect to that of a
bird.
On the whole it is certain, from anatomical characters
alone, that birds are modificatons of the same type as that
on which reptiles are formed, and if this similarity of
structure is the result of community of descent, we should
expect to find, in the older formations, birds more like
reptiles than any existing bird, and reptiles more like
birds than any existing reptile. If the Geological record
were sufficiently extensive, and the conditions of preser-
vation favourable, we ought to find an exact series of
links, but this, of course, is hardly to be expected, and it
will be a great step if we can show that certain forms tend
to bridge over the gulf between the two groups.
Let us see, then, what the facts of Palaeontology tell us
in this matter: and first, as to birds.
It is a curious fact that, just as in the case of Croco-
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
diles, all the birds found in the Tertiary deposits differ in
no essential respects from those of the present day.
Great numbers of remains have been found in beds of
Miocene age—beds found at the bottoms of great lakes
—and the very perfectly preserved specimens show, be-
yond any doubt, that the Miocene birds are referable to
precisely the same groups as those of our own time. Our
knowledge of the Eocene forms is less perfect, but enough
is known to show that the same fact held good at the
commencement of the Tertiary epoch.
Throughout the secondary period remains of bird3 are
very rare ; until lately, in fact, there were none at all.
But within the last ten or fifteen years some remarkable
discoveries have been made—one or two in Europe, and
a whole series in America, which give us some very pre-
cise information as to the nature of the Mesozoic birds.
Two of the most interesting of these—the genera Hes-
perornis and Ichthyornis—occur in certain beds in the
United States, corresponding in age to our later Cre-
taceous. Hesperornis is stated, by its describer, to have
had nearly the organisation of our Northern Diver
(Cofymbus) ; it was five or six feet in length, of swimming
habits, had small wings, like those of the Penguin or
Auk, and a long beak like the Diver. But—and this is
the interesting feature in its organisation—both jaws were
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
beset with teeth: not mere serrations of the jaw, such as
many existing birds have, but true teeth like those of a
reptile. Here then we have the appearance of a true
reptilian character.
Ichthyornis was, in some respects, even more curious.
It was about as large as a good-sized pigeon, had large
wings adapted for powerful flight, and teeth in both jaws,
like Hesperornis. In another character it showed a still
greater approximation to the lower reptilian type : the
bodies of its vertebrae, instead of having the cylindroidal
or saddle-shaped form so characteristic of nearly all birds,1
were bi-concave. Thus, in tracing birds back in time, we
find a parallel series of modifications to those described in
the Crocodilia.
Beyond this point, the history of birds is almost a
blank, the only other remains being—curiously enough—
one or two feathers, and the Archaopteryx of the Solen-
hofen slates, a formation which has been of great service
in the preservation of organic remains, the same qualities
which make it so useful for purposes of lithography
having fitted it for the preservation of even such perish-

and the ischium and pubis are both turned backwards,
parallel with one another, so as to have almost exactly
the same position as in birds. There can be no doubt
about this most remarkable point now, as the parts have
been found in place in the genus Hypsilophodon. The
femur was evidently brought parallel to the long axis of the
body, and it has the characteristic ridge between the
places of articulation of the tibia and fibula. The tibia
has a great crest on its front surface, the fibula is quite
small, and the flattened end of the tibia fits on to a pulley-
shaped bone exactly like the ankylosed astragalus of a
bird. The middle or third toe is the largest, and the
outer and inner toes small; the metatarsals, although
separate from one another, have their faces so modelled
that they must have been quite incapable of movement.
Substitute ankylosis for ligamentous union, and a bird's
metatarsus is produced ; in fact the whole structure of the
Dinosaurian hind-limb is exactly that of an embryonic
bird.
In the very remarkable genus Compsognatlius of the
Solenhofen slates, which is nearly allied to the Dino-

sauria, and included, with them, in the order Ornitho-
scelida, the head is small, the neck extremely long, and
the peculiarities of the hind-limb are entirely bird-like;
it also seems that the tibia and astragalus were actually
united. The foie-limb, moreover, was very small, and it
is certain that Compsognathus must have walked on its
hind-legs.
The question, then, naturally arises, did the gigantic
Dinosauria, such as Iguandon and Megalosaurus, have
the same mode of progression? This seems, at first
sight, hard to believe, but there is considerable reason for
thinking that it may have been the case, for, in the case
mentioned above of the great three-toed footprints of the
Connecticut valley and others found in the Wealden for-
mation, no impression of a forefoot has ever been found;
so that, even if we suppose that the impressions of the
fore-feet were entirely obliterated, as the animal walked,
by those of the hind-feet, the former must, at any rate,
have been very small.
When we consider what a very strong piece of evidence
this is, we are forced to the conclusion that the evolution
of birds from reptiles, by some such process as these facts
indicate, is by no means such a wild speculation as it
might, from a priori considerations, have been supposed
to be.

THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF RARE
PLANTS IN THE ALPS'
MDE CANDOLLE has recently distributed copies

Congress held at Florence in 1874, in which he explains
in a very convincing manner a fact which all botanists
have noticed in Switzerland, but the causes of which have
not hitherto been properly understood. No one is better
acquainted with the plants of the Alps than Mr. Ball, and
M. De Candolle prints as a text to his paper a remark
made by the well-known author of the Alpine Guide, that
it is matter of curious inquiry to ascertain why the vege-
tation of certain districts of the Alps is more varied than
that of others.
Two instances to illustrate this will be sufficient. The
mountain chain situated between Italy and the Valais is
rich in rare and local plants, while that between the Valais
and Canton Bern is veiy poor ; again, after tabulating the
species found in Switzerland in single cantons only, while
sixty-three are peculiar to the Valais, the Canton Bern

species into the Lower Valais, while others of later origin
were principally introduced by human agency.
During these changes the Mont Blanc district and the
country between the Alps and the Jura were still ice-
bound, and seeds carried by the wind from the south and
west would fall on snow or sterile moraines. And when
in their turn these districts were released, their oppor-
tunity of being stocked by the flora fast disappearing
from the lower levels had gone. The asylums which
were earliest opened were most richly supplied and have

M. De Candolle considers that a potent cause of the
extermination of this flora has been the destruction of
the forests which has rendered the climate south of the
Alps hotter and drier in summer, and colder in winter.
The rare plants of the Italian Alps are the remains
therefore of an ancient flora like that of St. Helena on its

migrating northwards—is now actually poorer than the

DEEP-SEA TELEGRAPH CABLES: HOW
THEY ARE TESTED
THE "testing" of a telegraph cable, whether long or
short, proceeds upon the principle that the materials
offer to the electrical current a certain resistance: the
testing of a cable is the measurement of this resistance.
In any cable there are two kinds of these resistance
measurements; one of the resistance which opposes the
current in its progress along the conducting wire, the other
of that which opposes its lateral dispersion. The conduc-
tor-resistance is technically termed the copper-resistance,
and is extremely small compared with the other resist-
ance. The lateral resistance to the escape of the current
opposed by the insulating substance which surrounds the
copper-conductor is technically termed the insulation-
resistance. Where the resistance to the direct propa-
gation of the electric current through a conducting wire is
represented in units, the resistance to lateral dispersion
through the insulator will be represented by hundreds, or

even thousands of millions, of these units. A third pro-
perty is that known as the electro-static, or inductive
capacity, or simply " charge "} of the cable; in other
words, that measured quantity of electricity which the
given cable will take up in a given time. So much for
the necessary explanation of technical terms.
The copper-resistance (1), the insulation-resistance (2),
and the "capacity" (3) are the three points to be ascer-
tained in the testing of a cable ; and it is useful to inquire
why these are the points to be ascertained.
The chief commercial requisite in any cable, and upon
which depends its value to its owners, is the speed with
which signals can be transmitted. Speed.depends directly
upon two of the foregoing points (that is" upon the copper
resistance and " capacity"), and indirectly upon the insula-
tion-resistance. Popular assumption is very much given to
the idea that the electrical worth of a cable increases with
its insulation-resistance; as usual with popular notions
this is only half-truth. That the cost of a cable follows
the ratio may or may not be, but it is certain that above a
definite limit the thickness of the insulating coating has

Siemens and Dr. C. William Siemens, who early in the
history of submarine telegraphy communicated their re-
searches on the subject to the British Association at the
Oxford meeting of i860. The principle of these early
methods still remainsthe principle of the methods employed
by Sir W. Thomson in his testing of the Direct United
States Cable at Ballinskelligs Bay Station in September,
1875, and upon which he has reported to the manufacturers
of the cable, Messrs. Siemens Brothers. It is the purport
of this paper to describe these tests and the results
obtained.
To those who may be unacquainted with the route of
„he Direct United States cable, it will be necessary to
explain that the course taken is from Ballinskelligs Bay,
on the west coast of Ireland, to Torbay, in Nova Scotia,
whence it again passes to Rye Beach, in New Hampshire,
America.
The construction of the cable, which was decided upon
by the company acting under the advice of Dr. William

ductor formed of a strand of twelve copper wires weighing
400 lbs. per nautical mile. This conductor is surrounded
with four coatings of gutta-percha and gutta-percha-com-
pound weighing 360 lbs. pet nautical mile, so that the
total weight of the " core," as it is technically termed, is
760 lbs. per knot. It was specified that the core should
have an insulation resistance per nautical mile equal to
160 millions of mercury units; tests, however, checked
and taken under the direction of Mr. von Chauvin, the
manager and electrician to the Company, show that no
length of core was passed that did not insulate to nearly
double this extent, or to 300 million units per knot, the tests
being taken after twenty-four hours^ immersion of the
core in water at 75° F, The "core " is " served " or enve-
loped in jute yarn, and is then sheathed or covered with
iron wires of a diameter best suited to the position of the
cable. Thus for the deep-sea, 1,630 knots of the cable
are sheathed with ten strands of wire and hemp, each
strand consisting of a homogeneous iron wire surrounded
with five strands of Manilla hemp, each strand being
passed through a compound of pitch, tar, and india-
rubber. Each of the iron wires has an average breaking
strain of 53 tons per square inch, and is of C099 inch
diameter. The cable termed medium cable is sheathed
with fifteen wires of 0-148 inch diameter w:'.'- Proper

sewings of yarn, while for the shore ends, where there is
considered to be more friction or wear, this medium
cable is again surrounded with iron sheathings of twelve
strands of iron wires, each strand consisting of three iron
wires of 0-230 of an inch diameter.
The cable from Nova Scotia to New Hampshire con-
sists of a strand conductor of seven copper wires weighing
107 lbs. per knot, covered with three coatings of gutta-
percha and compound weighing 150 lbs. per knot, and is
also sheathed with iron wires.
The non-electrical reader who may choose to wade
through detail that must be somewhat technical will
perhaps find help in considering the conducting wire as
representing a line of flow or force, such that if two of
these lines be directed into a galvanometer or current-
measurer in opposite directions, that having the greatest
head or greatest force will preponderate, while no indi-
cation will be found on the instrument when the forces
are equal; also that from a known force giving through

If, for instance, it is known that with a certain battery
power and a resistance of 100,000 units we have a deflec-
tion-measure of 100, it is deduced, when with an unknown
resistance and the same battery power the deflection of 50
is obtained, that the resistance must be twice as great
(namely, 200,000), since the observed effect is halved.
This system is that generally pursued, but, like the
other measurements upon submerged cables, comes under
the effect of earth-currents; and to meet this contin-
gency Sir William Thomson has arranged a new method,
bearing upon the principle that the insulation of a cable
may be determined from the proportion of loss (during a
given time) of electric power that has been imparted to
it. In the following description it will be seen that this
loss is measured by the deflection due to the current
entering the cable to make up the loss, and this deflection
is compared with another deflection obtained by altering
suddenly by a small quantity the battery power em-
ployed. The latter deflection being a measure of a known
force or potential, the other measure for lost potential
is determined, and consequently the loss of potential

"The cable being offered to me again from midnight
till 2 A.M. on the 17th, I made," says Sir W. Thomson,
"another series of tests at that time for the main object of
measuring the insulation-resistance. I found the line in
a much less disturbed state, and was able to make a per-
fectly satisfactory insulation test by the ordinary galvano-
meter method. I applied, however, also a new method
which (no electrometer being available) I had planned to
meet the contingency of the line being disturbed by
earth-currents so much as to render the ordinary test
unsatisfactory, but not so much as to vitiate an electro-
meter-test. This method, which I think may be found
generally useful for testing submerged cables when an
electrometer is not available, is as follows :—1. Apply the
ordinary test by battery and galvanometer for a certain
time. 2. Insulate the cable for a certain time and then
shunt the galvanometer to prepare for No. 3 (unless you
have conveniently available a second galvanometer suit-
able for discharges). 3. Instantaneously reapply the
battery, through the insulation galvanometer properly
shunted (or a special discharge galvanometer), to the
cable, and observe the maximum of the sudden deflection
produced. 4. Go on repeating Nos. I, 2, and 3 as long
as you think proper, according to circumstances. 5. To

determine the proper ballistic constant of the galvano-
meter for utilising the observed result of No. 3, rind the
maximum of the sudden deflection which takes place
when a sudden change of electrification is produced by
instantaneously changing by a small measured difference
the potential of one electrode of the galvanometer, the
other electrode being in connection with the cable. 6.
The change of potential which, in the operation of No. 5,
would give the same deflection as that observed in No. 3,
is equal to the change of potential which the conductor
of the cable has experienced during the time when it was
left insulated according to No. 2. Hence calculate the
insulation-resistance in ohms or megohms as in the ordi-
nary electrometer method when the electrostatic capacity
of the cable is known."
In carrying out this test, the 20-cell insulation battery
(with its poles joined through 20,000 Siemens' units) was
applied, zinc to cable, through the insulation galvanometer
with a shunt of 5,000 Siemens' units on it. Then, the

remarks: "I am glad to be able to say that my tests
proved the cable to be in perfect condition as to insula-
tion, and showed its electrostatic capacity and copper
resistance to be so small as to give it a power of trans-
mitting messages, which, for a transatlantic cable of so
great a length, is a very remarkable as well as valuable
achievement." This article would be exceeding its pur-
pose if it were to include inquiry into the present position
of Atlantic Telegraphy ; but it is a mark of great progress
in electrical engineering and cable manufacture that a
cable of such length as 2,420 miles can be delivered up
to the company working it in a perfect electrical condi-
tion. This has not been the case in earlier transatlantic
attempts ; and some idea may be formed by the general
reader of the care required to bring about this end, when
it is known that a small hole, smaller in size than .the
finest pin-hole, in any portion of the two thousand miles
length of gutta-percha covering would render the electri-

passing through St. Petersburg, bounds a space of low
pressure, or when St. Petersburg is included within the
area of a cyclone ; 2. When the isobar bounds the space
of high prccsure, or is within the area of an anticyclone;
3. When it is in the calm centre of an anticyclone; and

sion is carried out as regards the two great divisions of
the year, viz., the cold half, extending from October to
March, and the warm half from April to September.
The following will indicate the importance of the results
arrived at :— 1. During the cold half of the year, northerly
winds (N.E. and N.) when connected with a cyclone have
the pressure 0370 inch below the average, the tempera-
ture 2°"3 above the average, the relative humidity 90, and
the sky all but completely covered with cloud ; with an
anticyclone, pressure is 0271 inch above the average,
temperature 8°'6 below the average, humidity 84, and sky
only three-lourths covered ; and with a straight indeter-

minate isobar, pressure is 0201 inch above the average,
temperature 5°8 below the average, humidity 89, and sky
less than three-fourths covered. 2. During the warm
half of the year, northerly winds connected with a cyclone
have pressure C192 inch, and temperature 5°4 below the
average, humidity 87, and cloud 8 ; with an anticylone
pressure is o'2o6 inch, and temperature o'5 above the
average, humidity 75, and cloud 4; and with straight
indeterminate isobars, pressure is o 104 inch above, and
temperature 30 4 below the average, humidity 76, and
cloud 5.
As legards the S.E. wind, with a cyclone the tempera-
ture is 7°'2 above the average in winter, but only ii-8 in
summer; and with an anticyclone, 4°o below the average
in winter, but 2J'5 above it in summer. Again, with
straight isobars, S.E., S., and S.W, winds have in winter
a temperature 7°7 above the average, humidity 93, and
cloud 9 ; but in summer the figures are 5D'2, 82, and 6
respectively. One of the most suggestive results is that
obtained Irom the examination of the anticyclone in
summer, particularly as regards its calm central space.
In the periphery of the anticyclone where winds pre-
vail, the cloud accompanying the different winds varies
from 3 with S.W. to 5 with E. winds, but in the calm
central space the amount is only 2 ; in other words, the

space covered by the anticyclone is remarkable for the
clearness of its sky, and the central portion is the clearest.
Owing to the strong insolation which takes place under
these circumstances, the temperature of the whole space
covered by the anticyclone is raised 2°-i above the
average; with northerly winds (N.E., N., and N.W.) the
excess is, as might be expected, small, being only o°"5,
but with S. and S.W. winds the average excess is 4D'i.
The excess in the calm centre is only 1 J,3, which is smaller
than the excess which accompanies winds from the E.,
S.E., S., S.W., and W. points of the compass.
In a review of the weather of Europe during 1868,* Mr.
Buchan drew attention to the anticyclone which over-
spread a considerable portion of Europe from the 2nd to
4th August, as the immediate cause of the hot weather
experienced in Great liritain at the time, and which he
regarded as the simple result of the widespread high
pressure, the comparatively calm atmosphere, the clear
sky, the dry air, and the strong insolation which accom-
panied these conditions. At the same time, to the west,

lived 2,000 years before our era, is attributed the invention
of a chariot, upon which stood an elevated figure pointing
to the south, independently of any position of the chariot.
Nearly ten centuries later, we find the learned Tchdou-
Koung presenting and teaching the use of the tchi-nan-
kiu, or chariot indicating the south, to some envoys from
Youe"-tchang, a southern maritime province. The com-
pass, or, as it is even now called in Chinese, tchi-ndn,
appears to have been first used at sea by this remarkable
nation about the third century of our era, during the Tsin
dynasty.
When the compass became known in Europe is dis-
puted; Gilbert refers its introduction to Marco Polo about
1260,* but it is probable that earlier accounts of it were
brought from the East by the Crusaders, an accurate
description of it occurring in a poem entitled " La Bible,"
written by the minstrel Guiot de Provence about the year
1190. A Latin letter ascribed to Peter Adsiger, 1269,
preserved among the manuscripts of the university
of Leyden, contains the following remark on the declina-
tion of the needle :—" Take notice that the magnet, as
well as the needle that has been touched by it, does not
point exactly to the poles, but that part of it which is
reckoned to point to the south declines a little to the
west; and that part which looks towards the north in-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
clines as much to the east. The exact quantity of this
declination I have found, after numerous experiments, to
be five degrees."
The discovery of the dip of the needle is due to Robert
Norman, a nautical instrument maker at Wapping, near
London, who is described by Gilbert as "a skilful sailor
and ingenious artificer." He found that after being
touched by a magnet the needle always appeared heavier
at its northern end, and making an instrument to deter-
mine the greatest angle formed with the horizon, he ob-
served the inclination in 1576 to be 71° 50'.
In the early part of the following century, the variation
of the declination was clearly ascertained, and was attri-
buted by Bond, a teacher of navigation in London, to the
motion of two magnetic poles.
In the year 1600 was published the celebrated treatise
"De Magnete," by Gilbert of Colchester, who was pro-
nounced by his great contemporary Galileo, to be " great
to a degree that might be envied Gilbert regarded our
globe as a great magnet, and its centre as the centre of
the magnetic motions of the earth. Variation he defines

they entered, whilst those from the other side make

gives as the result of "many close thoughts" the follow-
ing explanation of the variation of the compass. "The
whole globe of the earth is one great magnet, having four
magnetical poles or points of attraction, near each pole
of the equator two ; and in those parts of the world which
lie near adjacent to any one of those magnetical poles,
the needle is governed thereby, the nearest pole being
always predominant over the more remote." He remarks
that the positions of these poles cannot as yet be exactly
determined from want of sufficient data, but conjectures
that the magnetic pole which principally governs the
variations in Europe, Tartary, and the North Sea is
about 7° from the north pole of the earth, and in the
meridian of the Land's End, whilst the magnetic pole
which influences the needle in North America, and in the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, from the Azores westward to
Japan, is 150 from the north pole, and in a meridian
passing through the middle of California. The variation

in the south of Africa, in Arabia, Persia, India, and from
the Cape of Good Hope, over the Indian Ocean to f.he
middle of the South Pacific, is ruled by the most powerful
of all these magnetic poles, which is situated 200 from the
south pole of the earth, and in a meridian passing through
the island of Celebes; in the remainder of the South
Pacific Ocean, in South America and the greater part of
the South Atlantic Ocean, it is governed by a magnetic pole
160 from the south pole, in a meridian 200 west of the
Straits of Magellan. On this hypothesis Halley explains
the variation observed in different places, and among
others cites the two following instances. On the coast of
America, about Virginia, New England, and Newfound-
land, the variation was found to be west, being above 200
in Newfoundland, 300 in Hudson Strait, and 57° in
Baffin's Bay. On the coast of Brazil, on the contrary, it
was found to be east, being 120 at Cape Frio, and increasing
to 2o£° at the Rio de la Plata, thence decreasing to-
wards the Straits of Magellan. Thus, almost in the
same geographical meridian, we find the needle at
one place pointing nearly 30° west, at another 20:}0 east;

illustrate each to an uniform scale. Therefore in the
present paper I will confine myself to the description
of the two forms of Artotrogus, and leave the considera-
tion of Peronospora and Pythium with De Bary's criti-

I.—Artotrogus, Mont.
To make my description of Artotrogus quite plain, it
is necessary to briefly recapitulate the early history
of the potato-fungus. Mdlle. Libert was one of the first
to describe this in 1844 In the same year Mr. Berkeley
writes he first saw diseased potatoes.
In 1845 Dr. Montagne described and illustrated the
potato fungus. In his illustrations he included certain
spherical bodies found in spent potatoes by Dr. Rayer;
these bodies were attached to threads, some of the bodies
being teimimal (Fig. 1, a), and others within the threads

in C>stopus and other of the Peronosporerc. A third
form (Fig. 1, D), was more or less echinulate, and this
was assumed to be the mature spore. Dr. Montagne, in
1845, did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of
these bodies, so he named them provisionally Artotrogus.
From 1845 till 1875, when 1 rediscovered the entire
series of these bodies in direct connection with Perono-
spora infeslans, in the Chiswick tubers, no record of their
rediscovery had ever been published. Botanists had
sought for Artotrogus in vain.
In 1846, in the first vol. of the Journal of the Royal
Horticultural Society, the Rev. M. J. Berkeley published
his famous paper on the potato-murrain (the essay is
dated Nov. 22, 1845), and in this paper Mr. Berkeley-
reproduces the description and illustration of Montagne's
Artotrogus. Mr. Berkeley's published belief has for many
years been that the spherical and echinulate forms of
Artotrogus belong to no other than the secondary con-
dition of the potato fungus.
In 1849, Mr. C. Edmund Broome, of Batheaston, dis-
covered a second species of Artotrogus; this was found
in decayed turnip. A copy of the original camera-
lucida drawing made by Montagne is here reproduced.
It shows the mycelial threads and the mature resting-
spore at E.

Fourteen years afterwards (1863), Prof. A. De Bary
published a paper on the development of parasitic fungi
in the Annates ties Sciences Naturelies, vol. xx. In this
paper the author illustrated, amongst other things, the
resting-spore of Peronospora parasitica, Corda, a plant
common upon turnips, &c. Part of De Bary's illustra-
tion is here reproduced to show the probability of the
second described species of Artotrogus being identical
with the Peronospora. Some allowance must of course
be made for the sketch of the turnip Artotrogus (Fig. 2),
as it was made in 1849 when resting-spores were little
understood, but it is clear that Mr. Broome detected

not only the resting-spore with its collapsed oogonium,
but probably also a group of antheridia (see the de-
tached antheridium in De Bary's illustration, Fig. 3).
This probable identity of the Artotrogus and Perono-
spora of the turnip, points in the direction of the probable
correctness of Mr. Beikeley's views as to the Artotrogus
of the potato. The oogonia of the turnip parasite are

observers, that they are one, including Peronospora. I
have seen them all growing from the same threads, and I
will now review the grounds on which De Bary refers
them to different fungi.
First, from De Bary's own words, I will show how
extremely near the connection was, even with him. The
italics are mine. He says (" Researches^" p. 256), "In
the tissues of potatoes penetrated with the mycelium of
Phytophthora (De Bary's new name for the potato
fungus) there sometimes appear other bodies which
might be regarded as oogonia or oospores of the potato
fungus. I have several times found them with Pythium
vexans in old collapsed tubers which had sprouted in the
ground, and once without Pythium in a living stalk which

searches," p. 258, Fig. 8\ x 4C0 dia.
had been on the ground. But they were always restricted
to those regions which were occupied by the Phytophthora
mycelium." And again, " It was certainly remarkable that
they were often situated close to the inner surface of the
cell-walls in places where externally the mycelium of

Phytophthora undoubtedly ran in the intercellular spaces,
or even where a short branch of it penetrated the interior
of the cell."
In his desire, however, to dissociate these bodies
from Peronospora, De Bary (p. 257) first says they were
found by Montagne in a "sprouted but not diseased
potato." But this statement becomes of no value when
De Bary himself confesses (as he does) that with him the
oogonia were always restricted to those regions which
"were occupied" by the Peronospora mycelium. I, too,
have found them in similar " regions " and upon the Perth

cases I found these bodies complete, mature, and without
any distinct indication of their being attached to my-
celium," and he says the same of Montagne's material
and afterwards of mine. But this statement (like the
former one) becomes of no value when we find the author
writing on the very next page that after "long searching
in vain he found them t» grow on the extremities of the
branches of a mycelium which is very like that of Pythium

¦working of the Yorkshire College of Science, which has
now been in existence for nearly two years. In the build-
ing which has been temporarily adapted to the purposes
of the College, I found abundant evidence of labour and
study on the part of both professors and students. The
attendance of seventy-five day and more than two hundred
afternoon and evening students during the present session
shows that the advantages offered by the College are be-
coming widely appreciated. Although youths are ad-
mitted at the age of fourteen, most of the students are
much older; I was informed that the average age was a
year and a half greater than at Owens College. The
chemical department has the lion's share of accommoda-
tion; the lecture-room is large and good, and the labora-
tory would allow of forty students working at the same
time. There have been few vacant benches during the
past term. Prof. Thorpe has a room fitted up as a
museum and reference library, and has also a private labo-
ratory. A considerable amount of work is done in the
department of mathematics and physics, but physical
teaching suffers from want of space. Practical work can
only be carried on in Prof. Riicker's private room. Geology
has been fairly attended, though the day class is but small
at present. Prof. Green is forming most instructive series
of rock-specimens, illustrating stratigraphical geology,

volcanic phenomena, and transitions in metamorphism.
Mr. Miall's biological lectures have resulted in some very
jjood work. He has prepared a large number of dissec-
tions for demonstration, including a series illustrating
Prof. Rolleston's "Forms of Animal Life ;" practical
work has been undertaken by several students, including
ladies, one of whom gained the highest place in an exa-
mination at the end of last term. Finally, the instruc-
tion on textile industries, under Mr. Beaumont, has been
made scientific in many respects, especially in relation to
the theory of colouring.
It can hardly be considered a misfortune that the
College has been started in temporary buildings ; for by
means of its present effort science will become more
widely appreciated, and much larger donations will come
to hand than those already received; and the construc-
tion of the permanent college buildings cannot fail to be
advantaged by the experience now being gained by the
professors. It is to be hoped that many wealthy York-

MIDDLE-CLASS EDUCATION IN HOLLAND
THE following article on this subject, " from a Corre-
spondent," appeared in the limes of Tuesday :—
It is not unfrequently the case that great nations search
laboriously for the solution of problems which smaller
peoples have completely solved, as one may say, without
effort. We old-fashioned English are at present devoting
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:54 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818384
much pains to discover a good system of education for
our middle classes, and yet we have only to cross the
Channel in order to see in actual work one altogether satis-
factory in a country whose manners, traditions, and laws
are almost those of our own.
According to the constitution of Holland there are three
degrees of education— Primary, Middle, and Superior.
As the Primary Education comprehends all schools in-
tended for children from six to twelve years of age, and
as the Universities, the Gymnasia, and other establish-
ments where the study of the ancient languages occupies
the first place, are considered as belonging to the Supe-
rior class, it follows that all educational establishments
not included in one or other of these categories are re-
garded as establishments for middle-class education.
It appears that until the year 1862 the Dutch were
no further advanced in respect of this kind of education
than we are now. Wishing to put an end to this state of
things, the Minister of the Interior (the Home Secretary)
of the time, M. Thorbecke, formerly Professor in Leyden
University, presented to Parliament a bill, which was
passed into law at the beginning of the following year.
From the discussions which preceded the adoption of
this law, we learn that its object is to insure a suitable
education to young people who are not obliged to learn a

business before the age of from fourteen to seventeen
years, and for whom, although they are not intended to
take up University studies, a deeper and wider instruction
is necessary than that which can be obtained at the primary
school.
Setting out from the principle that youths who quit
the primary schools may be divided into two classes
—those who are able to devote only two years, and
those who can aHord to give five years to further study,
it was decided that there should be two kinds of middle-
class schools, the one to have a two years' course, and
the other a course of five years.
The programme of study in the establishments in which
the course is one of two years, and which are called Lower
Middle-Class Schools, includes, in the first place, the
elements of Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry,
Natural History, Geography, History, and the Dutch
Language, and in addition, Drawing, Gymnastics, and
some idea of Political Economy and of Technology for
towns, and of Agriculture for the country. The teachers in
these establishments are moreover required to devote the

ble obstacle, though it is none to a father who is able to
rovide for the other wants of his son until the latter
eaches the age of seventeen or eighteen years.
A Dutchman who boasted greatly of the system which
lis country has adopted, and to whom I remarked that it
night be objected that in virtue of the system it was not
limself but the taxpayers who paid for the education of
lis children, replied eagerly: "But am I not myself a
axpayer? Does not the system which we have adopted
:ome simply to this, that instead of my being compelled
:o pay for the education of my children in a few years
tinder the form of very heavy school-fees, the law allows
me thirty or forty years in which to pay it under the form
of a tax? As for myself personally, it matters very little,
but look at my neighbour, whose three sons are being
educated at the Higher School. Change the system; his
taxes would perhaps be lessened by twenty florins, but, on
the other hand, the school fees would reach so high a
figure that he could not meet them. The case of my
neighbour is not an exceptional one; it is the case of
at least one-half of the parents who send their children to

the Higher Schools. Of 100 pupils who are now attend-
ing these establishments there would remain scarcely
one-half, and it would consequently be necessary to raise
to 35/. the fees to be paid by each of them; this figure
speaks more than all the arguments put together."
If in defence of a new order of things it is only neces-
sary to urge the argument of success, it must be confessed
that the advocates of the Higher Middle Schools of Hol-
land do not require to urge any others. By universal
consent the success has surpassed all expectation; it has
been complete. Yet whoever knows human nature will
not be astonished to find that these schools, simply because
of their success, are still the object of much criticism par-
ticularly among the Clergymen and Scholars of the country.
I should have wished to learn from M. Thorbecke, him-
self a very distinguished scholar, what he thought of these
criticisms. That statesman, however, being dead, I applied
to one of his former colleagues in Leyden University,
whose advice M. Thorbecke to a large extent followed at
the time when he was occupied in drawing up his scheme
of superior education. I will give yon a summary of our
conversation. Having asked if it was not a mistake to
found a system of cd 'cation which had not Greek and
Latin as its basis, he 1 c^lied as follows :—
"Allow me to observe to you that our Middle Schools
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
are not intended to produce scholars, orators, statesmen.
For these there are the Gymnasium and the University.
Has it moreover been thoroughly proved that the pro-
found sludy of a modern foreign language cannot, as
mental gymnastics, take the place of the study of a
dead language? I could name to you members of our
parliament who have never given any attention to Greek
and Latin, and yet who, as orators, are on a par with the
most eloquent of their colleagues. The Greeks are repre-
sented as having left to us in literature and in philosophy
monuments of a perfection such as modern writers can
never equal. Yet the Greeks studied no dead language
that I know of. Besides what would it serve, in the
matter of education, to make a theoretically perfect
law, when the mass of the public would condemn
it? If there jis one idea strongly rooted in the mind
of our middle classes, it is the conviction that Greek
and Latin are perfectly useless to anyone who has not
to pass through the University. It was daring enough to
give so large a place in our new schools to the mathe-
matical and physical sciences, to which our bourgeoisie

that your Lower Middle Schools have not succeeded. To
what is this ascribed?"
"It would be more correct to say that they have not suc-
ceeded throughout. Moreover, M. Thorbecke was never
under any delusion on this point. He considered the
Lower Middle Schools as placed for the future. The proof
is that he got inserted in the law a clause which enacts
that the Government may for a certain number of years
exempt a communal council from the obligation of
erecting a Lower Middle School if it is probable that a
sufficient number of pupils could not be obtained to
attend it. It is necessary first that the economical con-
dition of the country should be improved. Remember
that in Holland wages are in general lower than in all
the surrounding countries. We cannot blame our poor
artisans for requiring their children to earn some money
at the age when these would enter the Middle School."
Such is a risutne of what I have seen and heard in
Holland.

Societies at the Sorbonne, the Science Section was divided into
three committees—Mathematical, Physico-chemical, and Natural
History. The general meetings of the three sections were r re-
sided over by M. Leverrier, who developed at full length the
organisation of agricultural warnings which have been established
in Fuy de Dome, Vienne, and Haute Vienne, and will be in
operation from May 1 to October 15, when agriculturists have
piactically nothing to lose in the fields. About thirty stations
have been established in each of these departments and con-
nected by telegraph with the chief towns of the district. Each
local observatory will receive telegraphic warnings through the
prefet of the department, to whom will be sent daily the tele-
grams of the International Service. All these warnings will be
posted at the stations and special warnings for the vicinity
deduced by local meteorologists. All the observations taken
on these stations will be sent to the observatory and tabu-
lated under the supervision of M. Leverrier. The system
will very likely be extended to other departments. The
distribution of prizes was held on the 22nd in the large
hall of the Sorbonne. The Minister of Public Instruction, M.
Waddington, gave an address, in which he promised to create
new libraries, new faculties, and to group new faculties in order
to establish Universites. It is inferred thence that M. Wad-
dington, who, as is well known, is a Cambridge man belonging
to Trinity College, will try to remodel the French high schools

France is, perhaps, to be divided into the Universities of Paris,
Lyons, Lille, Marseilles, and Toulouse. M. Waddington's

men. Five gold medals were awarded—to MM. Abria (Bor-

(L)ons), palaeontology; Filhol (Toulouse), geology; Lortet

also awarded in botany, zoology, and natural philosophy. In
connection with this meeting, M. Lecoq de Boisbandran has
been made a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur. Several other
scientific men have been appointed officiirs of the University and
oMciers of the Paris Academy, which are special honorary
degrees in acknowledgment of some special services either in
the prosecution of scientific researches, or in carrying out the
results of the scientific investigations of other people.

The Physical Society of .Paris held its Anniversary Meeting
last Thursday.
On Saturday, the Times states, there was exhibited in Wolver-
hampton a meteorolite weighing 8 lbs. It is believed to have
fallen on Thursday afternoon in a turf field in a meadow near the
Wellington and Market Drayton Railway, about a mile north of
the Gradgington Station. It is stated that about ten minutes to
four, within a seven miles' radius of the Wrelcin, the villagers
were alarmed by an unusual rumbling noise in the atmosphere,
followed immediately by an explosion resembling the discharge
of heavy artillery. Rain was falling heavily throughout the
afternoon, but there was neither lightning nor thunder. About
an hour after the report what proved to be a mass of meteoric
iron was found in the meadow referred to at a depth of 18 inches,
having passed through 4 inches of soil and 14 inches of clay. It
rested upon the gravel underneath these. The hole is almost
perpendicular, and the meteorolite is assumed to have fallen in a
south-easterly direction. It is stated that the meteoric stone
when found was quite hot, although nearly an hour had elapsed
from the time of the explosion being heard.

We regret, however, to see that the mistake in science regarding
the height of the thermometers above the ground, pointed out by

currents seemed to him to point to a reason for the existence of
a warm region, like that which Herr Harm found for the high
temperature of the Fohn wind, namely, that in descending the
cold air becomes condensed, and by condensation raised in tem-
perature. From 4 P.M. on the 4th to 5 r.M. on the 5th of
November, 1874, readings of the temperature were token by four
observers at Innsbruck (575 metres), Rumer Alpe (southern
slope, 1,227 metres), Heiligwassertnorthem slope, 1,239 metres),
and at the summit of the Bluer (2,240 metres). The mean
temperatures for the twenty-four hours at these stations were
respectively, 2-i6, 7-06, 426, and — 64, The lowest nijjht
temperature at Innsbruck was — 28; on the Rumer Alpe,
+ 24. The minimum was reached at Innsbritck, just before
sunrise, but on the Rumer Alpe at 3.30 a.m. ; at sunrise at this
elevation the thermometer marked 44. At Heiligwasser the
same kind of relation was noted, and temperature rose after
4 a.m.; but the maximum by day was much lower than at Inns-
briick. The high temperature at this station was not due to
heating of the ground by sunshine, for a thermometer fixed on
the surface of the soil never rose above i° C. The wind blew
uninterruptedly towards the valley, down the mountain side.

There remains but one explanation, namely, that the increasing
pressure raises the temperature of the air as it descends. Prof.
Kerner proceeds to a more detailed analysis of the distribution
of currents over hill and valley both by day and by night, illus-
trating his theoiy by diagrams. After sunset the ground of the
valley and the air above it cool rapidly by radiation. The air
thus made specifically heavy cannot flow off, but rests like a lake
at the bottom of the valley. The current which has flowed
down the mountain sides being raised in temperature, glides over
this stratum, and rises about the middle of the valley, to rejoin
the polar wind aloft. I5y day the air ascends from the valley up
the southern slope, and is replaced by a current descending the
opposite mountain face. Obviously, the phenomenon of in-
creasing temperature with increasing height must be most strik-
ing where the ridges and valleys stretch from west to east, and
during periods of polar wind, when the sky is clear and radiation
strong.
Der Nalitrforschcr, January.—This number contains an ac-
count of observations by M. von Schleinitz, on board the
Gazelle, when on the transit expedition to Kerguelen's Land, of
changes of temperature and specific gravity of water in the
southern Indian Ocean. His conclusions are briefly these :—I.
Ocean currents, with the exception of the currents caused by re-
gular winds, are due to differences in absolute specific gravity of
diff-erent parts of oceans, and a small difference produces a strong
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
current. 2. The differences in saltness of tropical and cold seas
(in relation to absolute specific gravity), acting oppositely to the
temperature differences, moderates ocean currents, which would
otherwise be so strong in meridional directions that navi-
gation would be impossible. 3. There is probably a zone where
the differences in saltness compensate the differences in tempera-
ture, so that waters of different temperature and different salt-
ness may be near each other in equilibrium, i.e., without percep-
tible current. In the western part of the Indian Ocean this
zone is between 40' and 45" :-. lat.—There is a notice of two
recent series of researches by M. Voigt and M. Groth (conducted
by quite different methods), on the elasticity of rock salt; it is
shown that in regular crystals the co-efficient of elasticity, and
therewith the velocity of sound, is a function of the direction;
and that both vary, in accordance with Neumann's theory, sym-
metrically with reference to the planes of symmetry of the
crystal.—M. Frank calls attention to the action of light on the

of the calculation, however, led to no nearer approximation;
and finally, experiments with other materials for the tube and
other gases (namely, coal-gas and carbonic anhydride) were
made without resulting in any marked difference from the
results obtained with air and glass.

lating the sides and angles of spherical triangles. It consisted
of two wotxlen semicircles which could be fixed at any angle,
and a graduated arm moving on a universal joint which slid
along one of the semicircular arcs. The graduated arm was
made use of to measure the cord of the third side of the triangle.
Mr. Penrose showed how the instrument might be made use of
for loughly checking calculations in spherical trigonometry. He
thought that it would also be of use in expeditiously reducing
observations in which no great degree of accuracy was required.
The instrument was very portable and might be made si ill more
so if the griduatcd semicircles were divided on brass instead of
on wood, as in the instrument he showed. A paper by the Rev.

exterior satellites of Uranus which had been made by Mr. Isaac

before. The presence of vertebrae of the bare in the breccia
would imply that the hunters who occupied the cave had not the
dog as a domestic animal. After a discussion of the relations of
the animals forming the fauna of the cave, the author proceeded
to describe the traces of man found in it, which consist of frag-
ments of charcoal, and implements made of antler and mammoth
tooth, quartzite, ironstone, greenstone, and flint. The distribu-
tion of these implements in the cave represents three distinct
stages. In the cave-earth the existence of man is indicated by
the quartzite implements, which are far ruder than those gene-
rally formed of the more easily fashioned flint. Out of 94
worked quartzite pebbles only three occurred in the breccia,
while of 267 worked flints only 8 were met with in the cave-
earth. The ruder implements were thus evidently the older,
corresponding in general form with those assigned by De Mor-
tillet to " the age of Moustier and St. Acheul," represented in
England by the ruder implements of the lower breccia in Kent's
Hole. The newer or flint series includes some highly-finished
implements, such as are referred by De Mortillet to "the age
of Solutre," and are found in England in the cave-earth of
Kent's Hole and Wookey Hole. The discovery of these imple-

to the north and west, and at the same time establishes a direct
relation in point of time between the ruder types of implements
below and the more highly-finished ones above.—Notes on the
gravels, sands, and other superficial deposits in the neighbour-
hood of Newton-Abbot, by Horace B. Woodward, F.G.S. The
writer pointed out that most of the deposits termed Upper
Greensand in the immediate neighbourhood of Newton-Abbot,
were in reality intercalated with coarse gravel-beds, containing,
among others, fragments of greensand, chert, and chalk-flint.
He considered that the only traces of greensand in situ were
probably on the summit of Milber Down and east of Combe
Farm, deposits which were identified by Mr. Godwin-Austen.
But he could not agree in the identification of greensand at other
localities in the Bovey Valley, considering the few fossils found
to have been derivedt rom, and with much other material to have
been evidently due to,the denudation of chalk and greensand. He
pointed out the geographical distribution of these beds of sand
and gravel, which extend from the hill-tops bordering the Bovey
Valley to near the bottom of the valley, but do not descend into
any outlying valleys. He likewise alluded to the peculiar dip
into the valley which affects these beds in several places, and
observed that sometimes they rested on the Bovey clays and
lignites. He thought some connection in their method of form-
ation might be traced with somewhat similar deposits on the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Haldon and Black Down Hills. He pointed out the "Head"
at the bottom of the valley was sometimes not to be distinguished
from the older gravels, from which, however, it was largely
derived. He alluded to the discovery of bones, a bronze spear-
head, and a wooden doll or idol in this deposit ; observing that
they indicated the rapid accumulation of gravel, and that this
indication was one out of many that might be given, that our
modern river-gravels are to a great extent made up of older
gravels. In conclusion the writer alluded to some of the deposits
now forming on the margin of the Teign estuary, and which are
identical in character with the Triassic breccia.—On certain
alluvial deposits associated with the Plymouth limestone, by R.
N. Worth, F.G.S. The author adduced certain deposits found in
fissures and caverns of the Plymouth limestone, as furnishing
evidence in opposition to the views advocated by Mr. Belt in his
paper on the drifts of Devon and Cornwall.1 The best ex-
amples occur at Plymouth Hoe, where the chief deposit fills a
large "pocket" in the limestone, and consists (beneath the turf)
of a bed of clayey soil, containing pebbles and small boulders,
beneath which are patches of white and red clay, containing a
few pebbles, and overlying a large quantity of siliceous sand.
