GEIKIE'S "LIFE OF MURCHISON"
Life of Sir Roderick I. Murchison, Bart., F.R.S. etc.
Based on his Journals and Letters. With Notices of his
Scientific Contemporaries and a Sketch of the Rise and
Growth of Palcsozoic Geology in Sri tain. By Archi-
bald Geikie, LL.D., F.R.S., Director of H.M. Geological
Survey of Scotland, and Murchison Professor of Geology
and Mineralogy in the University of Edinburgh. 2 vols.
Illustrated with Portraits and Woodcuts. (London:
John Murray, 1875.)
TO have before us [in detail, and reflected as in a
mirror of his own notes and correspondence, the
story of the life of one who has taken a foremost place in
the ranks of science, is a matter of no little interest. We
want to know as much as we can of the kind of qualities
that go to make a successful man of science, and of the
circumstances which have enabled him to be useful to the
world. Such information may be obtained either by
categorical questions addressed to such men during life,
after the manner of Mr. Francis Gallon's work lately re-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:46 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
viewed in these columns,* in which we have the advantage
of numbers for comparison; or by the more detailed
story of the life of individuals, from which we can gather
for ourselves the answers to our questions, with all the
additional light thrown upon them by surrounding cir-
cumstances. *
Such a story is that presented to us by Prof. Geikie of
the life of Sir Roderick Murchison, whom no one will
deny to have occupied a foremost place, and to have con-
tributed valuable and lasting materials to the sciences to
which he devoted himself. Many, indeed, and fruitful
are the teachings of such a life as this, and some of them
are well pointed out by the author in his concluding lines.
Nor is the interest of the work confined to this. Not
only was Murchison eminent in science, but he ranks
among the founders of one of its most recent branches—
Geology; and hence, though in later years his name has

been more prominently connected in the public mind with
Geography, it is as a geologist alone that he will be
known to posterity; and the study of his life is an exami-
nation of the way in which some of the chief corner-stones
of Geology were laid.
Prof. Geikie has performed his promised task in an

admirable manner. It must be remembered that he was
asked by the subject himself to undertake the work, and
the materials out of which he was to develop it were
placed in his hands; and under these circumstances he
must necessarily be guided partly by the probable wishes
of the subject, and partly by the nature of his material;
and if it be a biographer's duty to " hold a mirror up to
nature," there can be no doubt that Prof. Geikie has
admirably done so. The scenes and circumstances that
formed so large a part of the acted life may well occupy
an equally large share in the written life, however much
geologists or students of human nature might wish for
different matter.
We have no doubt that Prof. Geikie would have
preferred to write such a life as we have indicated,
and he has done his best to escape from a " narrative
devoted merely to the personal events of Sir Roderick
Murchison's life;" but in loyalty to his friend he felt
bound, no doubt, to follow his desires rather than his
own. Those who are acquainted with Prof. Geikie's other
writings need not be told that this is written with admi-

done, as we may say, through some power of natural selec-
tion, by one whose qualities are adapted for that purpose
and for that alone, and whose greatness consists in being
exactly fitted in that respect to the time in which he lives,
and it may be in nothing besides. Before we consider
the relation which Murchison held in this way to Geology,
we may pass in review the chief incidents of his life as
detailed for us in these volumes.
Sir Roderick was descended from a sturdy Highland
stock, whose courage and perseverance he inherited, but
who contributed no further to his fortune. His father
was a surgeon, who, afttr making a fortune in India,
returned to his native land and bought the estate of
Tarradale, in the eastern part of the county of Ross,
where Roderick was born on Feb. 19, 1792. When the
boy was only three years old the family removed to Catb,
where the father died in 1796. Three years after,
Roderick's mother married a second time, and the boy,
at the age of seven years, was sent to the grammar
school of Durham. Here he seems to have learnt little
but mischief; but educational requirements were not
great in those days, and he probably knew at the end of

his six years as much as most of his contemporaries. Cer-
tainly his education here had no manner of influence,
as far as we can see, on his future career;' and the
absence of scientific culture in youth, if it did not pre-
vent him from rising to greatness and doing good work,
would most decidedly have done so had he been thrown

and it certainly confined him to the limits of a geological
worker instead of allowing him to become a geological
philosopher.
After leaving Durham, and visiting his uncle, General
Mackenzie, who persuaded him he would make a good
soldier, he was sent to the military college at Great Mar-
low. The two )ears he spent here cannot be said to have
been without use to him, for if he learnt but little from
books, he was forced to undergo the more special training
for a soldier's career, vi hich in after life had a solidifying
effect on his character. At this time his uncle wrote of
him: "He is a charming boy, manly, sensible, generous,
waim-hearted. I think he has talents to make a figure in
any profession." At the age of fifteen he was gazetted
Ensign in the s6lh Regiment, which, after picking up
some scraps of knowledge in Edinburgh, he joined in
Ireland. He had not long to wait for work, for in the
following year (1808) his regiment was ordered to the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Peninsula, and he received his " baptism of fire " at the
battle of Vimieira. We need scarcely say of any English
soldier that he behaved with bravery in battle, and forti-
tude under tr) ing circumstances: but, after a short dis-
play of these qualities, a retreat was ordered from
Corunna, and Murchison returned home, being nearly
wrecked in the transport. Though he joined his uncle
Mackenzie as aide-de-camp in the following year, he
never again succeeded in getting into active service, and
this induced him, after eight years' career, to retire from
the army.
Murchison was evidently a keen soldier, and it seems
probable that, had he found adequate scope for the
irrepressible energy of his character in this direction,
Geology would have lost his] services. At the age of
twenty-three, on August 29, 1815, he married Miss Char-
lotte Hugonin, daughter of General Hugonin, of Nursted
House, Hampshire; an event which had a more than
usual influence on his future career. In the first place,
her fortune, combined with his own, enabled him to devote
himself to any pursuit he might take up, without having

the only good work as yet done in this direction being
that of Wm. Smith—a man considerably like Murchison
in character, though in a lower walk of life, and who had
mapped and arranged most of what we now call secondary
rocks. Much remained yet to be done both among these
and above them, but below them was a perfect blank.
No one had yet attempted to attack the monster " Grau-
wacke" in his fastnesses. It was not, however, to be
conquered by a tyro, and it was only after minor attempts
elsewhere that Murchison made the assault upon it from
above, while Sedgwick undermined it from below.
Murchison's life hitherto has not been such as to lead
us to expect much of him; but a study of his biography
and a knowledge of his works prove that we must from
this time see him in a different light; without indeed the
advantages of early training, yet earnestly doing his best
under the circumstances to advance the cause of science
in that way in which alone he could hope to do so. He
was one of those who

and wc next hear of him as a diligent student of Brande,
Buckland, Webster, and Wollaston, and very shortly fol-
lowing out, at the suggestion of others, some new lines of
inquiry, where information was wanted. The discussion
of these works we will postpone for the present, and pass
on to the sketch of his life henceforth as detailed for us
so clearly by Prof. Geikie.
His first excursion was in the summer of 1825, when
he was accompanied by his wife, and made a tour of nine
weeks on the south coast, from the Isle of Wight into
Devon and Cornwall. "Driving, boating, walking, or
scrambling, the enthusiastic pair signalised their first
geological tour by a formidable amount of bodily toil"
Murchison associated himself early in his geological
career with Sedgwick, with whom he had many a happy
and profitable tour, the first of which took place in 1827,
when they went together to the Island of Arran. Mur-
chison's summers for many years now were spent in the
field, while his winters in London were given to society,
and to the work of the Secretary of the Geological Society,
which he voluntarily undertook. It was not till 1831 that
he first broke ground in "Siluria," the results of which
appeared after many delays, in 1838, in the well-known
"Silurian System." He was not content with work in
England only, but quite as often traversed the Continent,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
bringing home results, and enjoying the society of the
chiefs of geology abroad. No sooner was his first work
well off his hands than he began to contemplate an excur-
sion to Russia to trace the same rocks there, and having
been partially successful in 1840, the next year he
surveyed the whole of the Ural Mountains under the
auspices of the Emperor, and with the assistance of Count
Keyscrling and De Vcrneuil, the results of which survey
appeared in 1845 in the magnificent work entitled " Geo-
logy of Russia and the Ural Mountains."
From this time Murchison's position in the ranks of
geologists was secure. How did he use it? To this
there can be but one answer. He used all the influence
his position gave him for the advancement of science.
His personal energies never flagged ; no summer passed
but he did good work, which now forms part of the
common property of geologists. Each autumn saw him
enthusiastically engaged in the work of the British
Association, of which he was president in 1846, and in
which he ever continued to take a genuine interest.
During these years his devotion to the Geographical

possessions whose vegetable wealth botanists have under-
taken to describe in a systematic order, is due to various
causes, not the least of which is the enormous labour of
collecting and sifting the scattered literature bearing on
this subject. The books and short papers on the botany
of various parts of India are exceedingly numerous, and
several works have been commenced never to be com-
pleted. Dr. Hooker himself, in conjunction with Dr. T.
Thomson, published some years ago the first volume of a
Flora of India based upon a more elaborate plan than
that of the work now in progress, which departs from
that of the other Colonial Floras, Hooker's "Student's
Flora of the British Islands " having served as a model.
In addition to British India proper, this work embraces
the territories of the Malayan Peninsula, Kashmir, and
Western Thibet; but Afghanistan and Baluchistan, having
been taken up by Boissier in his " Flora Orientalis," are
not included. The total area under investigation'exceeds a
million square miles, exhibiting every variety of climate,
soil, and other conditions, and ranging from the sea-level
to an altitude of 19,000 feet, which is about the upper

limit of flowering plants. Dr. Hooker computes the total
number of species growing within this area at 12 to I4,oooj
which is doubtless not very] wide of the mark, judging
from the number reached up to the end of the Sapin-
dacece.
In the first place we will give a glance at the contents Of
the present volume, which forms about a sixth part of
the whole work. Exclusive of an index of forty pages, it
extends to about 700 pages, and includes descriptions of
2,250 species under 442 genera, belonging to forty-four
natural orders. These figures do not take in introduced
plants incidentally mentioned or fully described. Con-
trasting these numbers with those afforded by the flora of
tropical Africa up to the end of the Sapindacece, we
obtain some idea of the relative richness of the vegeta-
tion of tropical Asia, especially if we bear in mind that the
area of tropical Africa is more than six times the extent
of India. True, African vegetation is not so well known,
but future discoveries in the respective countries will pro-
bably not materially alter the proportions. The numbers
for tropical Africa, which we have added up in Oliver's
"Flora of Tropical Africa," are 945 species in 250 gene^
and forty-five natural orders. It will be seen that the num-
ber of natural orders is almost the same, one more being
represented in Africa than in India. A very large propor-

tion of the species enumerated in the volume before us
are exclusively Asiatic ; we have not made an exact calcu-
lation, but should estimate it at ninety per cent. Of the
442 genera, 164 are, so far as our present knowledge goes,
peculiar to Asia. The greater part of the peculiar genera
are tropical, and many of these, doubtless, still remain to
be discovered in New Guinea and tropical Australia. The
mountains of Northern India have furnished our parks
and gardens with many useful and ornamental trees, &c.;
e.g., Cedrus DeodarazsA Pinus excelsa; and many others
might be introduced with a view to profit or pleasure. In
most cases, where possible, Dr. Hooker gives the altitudes
at which the species are known to occur; but of course
this part must still be imperfect. We have made a list of
those species reported as growing above 10,000 feet, and it
includes nearly 250 species, or about a tenth part of the
whole number. These belong chiefly to the Ranunculacea,
Crucifera, and Caryophyllea, and contain a large number
of endemic species; the remainder being chiefly common
either to Siberia or the Alps of Southern and plains of
Northern Europe,'including many common British plants.

so unaccustomed to this method. Under each genus and
species the geographical area is given, and in most cases
pretty fully; but most of the numerous discoveries in
tropical Australia since the publication of the "Genera
Flantarum" have been overlooked: we allude to those
already published in the "Flora Australiensis." Other
little slips of this sort occur. For instance,', there is a
species of Berberis in Abyssinia.
Dr. Hooker has contributed largely to this volume, and
the following botanists have assisted:—Dr. M. T. Masters,

Prof. W. T. T. Dyer, Dipterocarpea:, &c. ; Prof. Lawson,

P. Edgeworth were also associated with Dr. Hooker in
the elaboration of certain orders. A comparison of the
work of the different contributors brings out the defects of
tome rather strongly, but it would obviously be unfair to
single them out, because they have not done quite so well
as the best.

person from another country is likely to be. It seems to me,
however, that the diminution in the number of geologists, com-
pared with the students of other sciences, if not in absolute
number, is clear on simple inspection of the field. It is true
not only of Great Britain, but of France and America as well.
Of mining engineers there is, I believe, a great plenty ; but of
men who are trained in field work, who can be trusted to unravel
a set of rocks, or who care for the science as a science, and not
as a means of winning a living, there are far too few.
A year ago I had to organise a geological survey in the State
of Kentucky. 1 needed three topographers and three assistant
geologists who could stand alone. I picked my topographers
from over a hundred competent applicants; I should have
searched in vain for months lor two of my geologists, had it not
been that the suspension of the Missouri Survey gave me trained
men. But for this I should have been driven to Germany, that
inexhaustible reservoir of trained men, for my helpers. In
our schools it is still worse: geology is taught in the air, not on
the earth. The student never gets into the field for practical
work, and the science remains for him a thing of names and
shadows. With the hope of doing something to remedy these
evils, there is to be a Summer School of Geology, intended for

workers in the science, taught in connection with the work of
the Kentucky Geological Survey; it will be, in fact, though
taught in Kentucky lor the present, the Harvaid Summer Term
in Geology, all the instructors in that department from this Uni-

Already over one hundred persons have applied (or admission to
the school, but the number will be limited to thirty: this list
now includes twenty-five teachers of schools of academic grade,
and five graduates of colleges who propose to become geologists.
As the school will be placed in a camp, it will be possible, if it
succeeds, to establish it in a new region each year, so that
teachers attending for, say, three years in succesMon, may get
a fair notion of our rocks, and, what is lietier, learn how to
do field work. I believe that the novelty of the life, the
freedom and fresh air, will make it possible lor teachers to use
iheir vacation lime in study without damage. I am nut without

beginners provided with that practical introduction to geology

Summer Jnstruftion in Gtohgy, 1875
In order to furnish an opportunity for teachers in natural
science and special students in Geology to become acquainted
with the methods of practical work in that science, a Summer
School of Geology will be established, during the monihs of July
and August, at a camp near Cumberland Gap, in the State of
Kentucky. This place has been chosen on account of the
eminent advantages it offers for the study of a great section of
the American Paleozoic rocks, and of the structure of the Appa-
lachian Mountains, and on account of the co-operation of the
Kentucky Geological Survey which is promised in a letter from
the Governor of that State to the President of the University.
It is also a very healthy region.
The special object of this school will be to teach students to
observe, but instruction will be provided in Physical Geology,
Historical Geology and Palaeontology, Chemical Geology, and
Topographical Engineering, as far as these subjects are connected
with geological work. The instruction will be necessarily in-
complete, and will be expressly directed to the elucidation of the
problems furnished by the area to be explored. The co-opera-

The Rdlt of Feet in the Struggle for Existence
May not the "set " of the feet in various races of men have
played a not unimportant part in the struggle for existence? In
thinking over the subject the following points have occurred to
me, and perhaps some of your readers may be able to throw
some further light on the question.
In the case of the North American Indian, for example,
except that he wears soft mocassins instead of stiff boots,
he is less in a state of nature as regards his feet than we
are. For we, and all the Teutonic tribes for countless gene-
rations, have paid little regard to our feet except as instru-
ments of unconscious progression or as pedestals on which
to stand firm. The North American Indian, on the contrary, is
obliged by his habits of life, and has been obliged for hundreds,
perhaps thousands of years, to direct his particular attention in
no small degree to the position of his feet. For in hunting it is
of the greatest importance that he shall not tread on any rotten
stick which may snap with a loud noise and alarm the game of
which he is in pursuit. On the war track it is ol equal import-
ance that he shall deceive his enemies as to the number of his
party, and so each man carefully steps in the footprint of the
warrior who had preceded him. This, I should think, would

be decidedly easier if the foot were kept
pointing straight fore and aft than if it
Hi^<Sk\ /Pi were held obliquely. This may be more
evident from the three rough outlines I
have drawn of footprints in each posi-
tion, in which I have made the differ-
ence in the length of the stride much
the same. Indeed, the difference is
greater in the fore and aft one, and yet
the impression made by the three foot-
prints will not be so large as when
the foot is oblique. In walking in
snow-shoes, too, the feet must be held as nearly as possible
parallel, as otherwise the shots are apt to catch in each other
and trip their wearer up. It seems quite possible that long-
continued attention to the position of the feet for many gene-
rations, together with the advantage which a parallel position of
the feet may have conferred in the struggle for existence, may
have led to its becoming a permanent characteristic of the Red
Indian; while the advantage which the outward direction of the
feet may have given the old Saxon, by affording a firmer support
in a hand-to-hand struggle, may have led to its permanence in
the successors of those who possessed this peculiarity, and by its
means enabled them to overcome their opponents.
I cannot be quite sure about the ancient Egyptians. If I

remember rightly, the Farnese Hercules has toes pointing con-
siderably outwards, while Mercury generally has his feet more
or less parallel. This would indicate that the Greeks associated
the former position with strength and firmness, and the latter
with fleetness. As fleetness will also aid the North American
Indian in the struggle for existence, it is possible that its asso-
ciation with a parallel foot may have something to do with the
peculiar formation of his ankle-joint. This, however, leads us
to the question which I do not think has ever yet been taken up:
In what way does the possession of a certain kind of weapon and
the use of particular methods of warfare influence the conformation
of the body? Have the descendants of the Teuton tribes toes
which point outwards because their forefathers used clubs, axes,
and targets, and have the Red Indians of the present day parallel
feet because their forefathers used arrows and keen tomahawks, and
trusted to agility rather than to brazen studs and thick bull-hide
for escape from the blows of their adversaries? X.

attention, and it may soon be possible to gain an idea o

requiring pretty large telescopes to be brought into requisi-

principal component a 7th magnitude, bright yellow ; the
smaller one a Qth and dusky. This staris Herculis 197

moon in December next will rise on the 8th, and will not
set until the 18th, attaining her greatest altitude above the
horizon at meridian passage on the I3th. The sun during
this interval is, of course, invisible in lat. 82° N.,but there
is continuous moonlight for between nine and ten days
and similarly for other months during the Arctic winter.
THE SOLAR ECLIPSE, 1876, MARCH 25.—This
eclipse will be a very similar one to that of March 1858
which created so much interest in its passage across this
country: it will be annular, but in those parts of the
track of central line, where the augmentation of the
moon's geocentric semi-diameter is greatest, the eclipse,
though still annular (as in England in 1858), approaches
very near a total one. Vancouver Island is situate in

of No. 110, calculated by Dr. Oppenheim of Konigsberg,

four feet loner. It is probable that it is identical with one
of the New Zealand Fur Seals, described by Dr. Gray as
Otaria cinerea. If this should turn out to be the case, it
will have a wider range than any of the others of the
group.
There is certainly another species of Sea Lion on the
coast of New Zealand, called Hooker's Sea Bear— Otaria
hoekeri. Its only certain habitat is the Aucklands. It is
a large species, the males about six feet long, the females
proportionately smaller. Though these New Zealand
coasts and islands, together with the coasts of the main-
land of Australia, have been visited and surveyed in
every direction by English expeditions, no one has ever
thought of preserving specimens for museums, so that we
really know less about the seals of our colonies than we
do about those of foreign coasts. Thus there is certainly
a large species on the west coast of Australia, at the
group of islands called Houtman's Abrolhos, described
by Dr. Gray as Ncophoca lobata. We are almost equally
ignorant about the Sea L ons of the Cape of Good Hope.

main that of the Sea Bear, as do the limbs, the thumb

as in the male, never exceed twenty-six inches in length,
including the imbedded root of six inches. The creature
is omnivorous. It is becoming very scarce in its favourite
haunts, on account of the indiscriminate way in which it
is slaughtered. Upwards of r,ooo are still taken annually
in the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen. Formerly it was
found at Bear Island and on the coast of Finmark. It is
still found on the east coast of Greenland, on the west
shore of Davis' Straits, about Pond's, Scott's, and Howe
Bays. In 1775 they resorted, to the number of over 7,000
a year, to the Magdalen Islands, at the mouth of the St.
Lawrence, and the English once had a fishery at Cape
Breton. It can be mentioned only as a straggler to our
coasts.
Every part of the animal is of value—the tusks, the
hide, and the flesh. The word Walrus means "Whale
Horse," Ross being the Danish for a steed. Morse is
Russian. The Greenlanders call it Awiik, a name derived,
it is said, from the cry of the young animal.

held by the corner against the knob of a small charged
jar, and, with one knob of the discharging rod resting
against the outer coating, the other be brought up to the

pass over the surface of the pane, turn over its edge, and
thus arrive at the knob of the rod. Nothing is visible on
the plate until it is breathed on, and then the condensed

lines, bringing out the trunk, branches, and minute spray
of the dendritic figure in a very perfect manner. In the
discussion that followed the reading of my paper, the
president of the section remarked that the figures ex-

thick, the main discharge may not pass, in which case the
plate represents spray only. Hence I infer that the spray
precedes the discharge and acts as a feeler for the line of
least resistance. Indeed, it is an old observation of
sailors, that before the ship was struck everyone on board
felt as if cobwebs were being drawn over his face.
The accompanying (Fig. i) is one of the figures produced
as above described, the separate figure being an enlarged
portion of the stem or trunk which represents the main
discharge. Other examples may be found in the "Eng-
lish Cyclopaedia" (Arts and Sciences division), article
"Breath Figures," and in the Edinburgh New Philoso-
phical Journal for October 1861.
After the reading of my paper I was anxious to see
some examples that had been undoubtedly produced by
lightning of these ramified figures. I was gratified by
the receipt of a letter from Dr. Pooley, of Weston-super-
Mare, informing me that he had actually seen a tree
struck by lightning, that the inner surfaces ot the de-
tached bark contained ramified figures such as I had
described, and that he had sent specimens to Dr. Fara-
day. I accordingly applied for permission to examine

but the following engraving (Fig. 2) represents their

In the Lancet of July 30, 1864, Dr. D. Mackintosh
describes a case in which a straw stack was struck by
lightning and set on fire, while a man who had sought its
shelter was killed, and two boys injured. One of the
boys, aged ten, said he felt "dizzy all over;" his legs
would not carry him, and he felt pain in the lower part of

"Treatise on Medical Geography," to apply to them the
term Keraunography (to write with thunder). Mr.
Poey, in 1861, published a small volume in which twenty-
four illustrative cases are cited. The author starts with
the popular notion that the dendritic figures referred to
are derived from some near or distant tree, and then pro-
ceeds to account for them by means of a photo-electric
action in which the surface of the animal is the sensitive
plate; the tree, &c, the object; and the lightning the force
that impresses it.

others, who possess the invaluable art of recording their

desire of explaining everything often amounts to a kind
of rabies, when the sane course seems to be to wait; for

covery, when in due time they are gathered in under the
sickle of the appointed reaper. Three such facts are the
following :—
1. In September 1825, the brig // Buon Servo, an-
chored in the Bay of Armiro, was struck by lightning,
and a sailor who was sitting at the foot of the mizenmast
was killed. Marks were found on his back, extending
from the neck to the loins, including the impression of a
horse-shoe, perfectly distinct, and of the same size as the
one that was fixed to the mast.
2. In another case that occurred at Zante, the number
44 in metal was attached to the fixed rigging between the
mast and the cot of one of the sailors. The mast was
struck and the sailor killed. On his left breast was found
the number 44, well formed and perfectly identical with
that on the rigging. The sailors agreed that the number
did not exi^t on the body before the man was struck.
3. M. Jose" Maria Dau, of Havannah, states that in
1828, in the province of Candelaria, in the island of
Cuba, a young man was struck by lightning, and on his
neck was found the image "d'un fer a cheval qui avait
e"te" cloud a peu de distance contre une fenctre."
Unexpected light was thrown upon such cases by Mr.
C. F. Varley (Proc. Roy. Soc, Jan. 12, 1871), in following

nished with brass balls about an inch in diameter.
Noticing some specks on the ball of the positive pole,
Mr. Varley tried to wipe them off with a silk handker-
chief, but in vain. He then examined the negative pole,
and discovered a minute speck corresponding to the
spots on the positive pole. This pole sometimes exhibits
a glow, and if in this state three or four bits of wax, or
even a drop or two of water, be placed on the negative
pole, corresponding non-luminous spots appear on the
positive pole. Hence it is evident that lines of force
exist between the two poles, by means of which we may
telegraph through the air from the negative to the posi-
tive pole. And in explanation of the above cases in
which the lightning-burn on the skin is of the same shape
as the object from which the discharge proceeded, all
that is necessary is that the object struck be + to the
horse-shoe, brass number, &c, the discharge being a nega-
tive one. C Tomlinson

All this together shows a regularly working institution,
which, we believe, deserves the full attention of scientific
men as a new element, or, to use an expression applied
to it once by Prof. Owen, a new dynamic in science.
The following is an abstract of Dr. Dohrn's inaugural
address :—
Dr. Dohrn began by referring to the success which has
hitherto attended the Naples establishment, to the Ander-
sonian School of Natural History in America, and to the
Zoological Station which the Austrian Government pro-
poses to establish at Trieste. He then proceeded to show
what may in time be expected from the institution; in
what its duties principally consist.
The original purposes of the undertaking was to facilitate
the labours of the zoologists who come to Naples from
all parts of Europe to study the marine animals of the Bay.
,For this purpose it is of course necessary to enter into
relations with the fishermen in the Bay, in order to obtain
the needed supply of fish; but this method is so far
from satisfactory that Dr. Dohrn, as soon as the state of
funds permits, is resolved to obtain a small steamer,
properly fitted up; with such assistance only can the
purposes of the institution be satisfactorily carried out.
Dr. Dohm then referred to the library of the Station,
which he is exceedingly anxious to make as complete as
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
possible, and hopes that authors,publishers, and academies
will continue to supply the wants of the Station in this
respect. He is especially anxious to obtain systematic
works, the want of which has already made itself pain-
fully felt. The institution greatly depends upon its pecu-
niary resources, and he hopes those who are friendly to its
purpose will continue to lend it a helping hand.
The Zoological Station will continue to supply foreign
universities, laboratories, museums, and private collec-
tions with marine animals, carefully preserved according
to the directions of the person who orders them.
Besides thus endeavouring to further the work of
others, the Station has important scientific tasks of its
own. One of the chief of these is an exact determination
of the fauna of the Bay. Not only for its own sake is
this task one of the first duties of the Station, but it will
be of great assistance in facilitating the work of the
Station in other directions. It may be objected that the
smallness of the means at the disposal of the Station is
inadequate to the fulfilment of all these purposes.
While the justice of this objection is admitted, there is

means of which we should be enabled better to under-
stand both the past and the future, and to judge more
clearly of the present.
The important bearing which the work at the Naples
and similar stations had on the elucidation of this law
was then pointed out. "Every fish, every crab, every
Medusa is the result of a long process of development,
which we have to trace, and the determination of which
the Zoological Station is intended to facilitate. That is
its purpose ; it was for that end that I built it, and for
that reason I have asked you to lend your support to my
efforts."

seven. There were three of us in the car—M. Duruof, Mr.
Marriott, an English correspondent in Paris, and myself.
The 'maximum altitude reached was about 12,000 feet.
The ascent was very gradual, and the above height was
reached only at six o'clock. No sensible effect was per-
ceived, although the temperature of the air, which on the
ground was about 50° F., was no more than 26° at this
altitude. We tried several experiments, with what suc-
cess it remains to determine on examination of the appa-
ratus. Some of the results, however, I am able to state
here.
We had suspended to the net a number of cages con-
taining small birds and guinea-pigs. The current of gas
had a decided inclination to flow in a certain direction,
and we had not ascended 6,000 feet when one of the birds
was found dead by suffocation. It was the only bird
exposed to the inhalation of the current of gas, and no
other was injured. It was proved by a careful autopsy
executed this morning by Dr. Lionville that this bird had
perished by intra-osseous haemorrhage in the cranium.
The haemorrhage had taken place on both sides, and
without any lesion appearing to the exterior.
We discovered that not less than four different banks
of clouds, were being carried over Paris and its vicinity.
Before the end of our journey the clouds had consider-

ably diminished in thickness, and the blue sky appeared.
I was able to take some thermo-solar observations with a
blackened bulb thermometer in vacuo.
As the effect on our constitutions of our 12,000 feet trip
was very trifling, I am of opinion that the experiment may
be scientifically conducted gradually to an immense alti-
tude, independently of previous catastrophes.

behind him the record of very numerous researches, of which
those on the sulpho compounds, corresponding to glycerine and
its derivatives, .on the oxysulphides of phosphorus, on the action

with the Antarctic Ocean. Passing along the west coast of
Luzon, the Challenger entered a little enclosed sea extending from
the north point of the island of Tablas to the strait between the
north-east angle of Panay and the south-west point of Masbate.
Here another series of interesting temperature soundings was
taken, the temperature at bottom, 700 fathoms, being Sl'70.
The temperatures generally in this Panay Sea were to a certain
extent intermediate between those in the China Sea on the one
side and the Zebu Sea on the other, leaving it uncertain whether
the cleft in the barrier to the depth of 150 fathoms is between
Tablas and Panay or between Romplon and Sabuyan. After

THE enterprise of the Scottish Meteorological Society
we have had frequent occasion to refer to, and the practical
as well as scientific value of the work it undertakes does
it the greatest credit, especially when its narrow means is
taken into consideration. One of its latest publications is
a diagram by Mr. G. Thomson, Fishery Officer, Lybster,
Caithness, showing for the months of July, August, and Sep-
tember, 1874, the catch and quality of the herrings, and the
varying positions of the herring-ground in the district of Lybater,
as also the meteorology of the district. The diagram, which
has been revised by the secretary, Mr. Buchan, is ingeniously
constructed and quite intelligible. There are two series of con-
joined curves and tables, the first showing all details belonging
to the meteorology of each day, and the second showing the
catch and quality of fish. Underneath are a sketch of the
coast and indications of the different fishing grounds occupied.
The diagram, we believe, is intended for distribution among the
various district fishery officers in Scotland, with the view of
inducing some of them to prepare similar diagrams for 1875 for
their own districts. With these, and the observations from

the valuable ferial (2tvl January part) on tlie part played by
carbonic oxide gas in smoking. This treatise is by Dr. Vohl,
and refutes Dr. Krause's opinion. He says: "It is evident
from Dr. Krause's account that he is unaware of the experiments
made by Dr. H. Eulenberg and myself as far back as 1871,
which proved the presence of carbonic oxide in tobacco smoke.
I cannot, however, agree with the idea that the physiological
effects of smoking are to be in part or wholly attributed to this
gas, as it varies greatly in the quantity in which it is present in
smoke. This quantity is never considerable, and the effects in
question must rather be ascribed to the volatile organic bases,
which form while tobacco is burning. Dr. Krause owns himself
that his analytical results are not exact, on account of the method
he used in obtaining them; these results cannot therefore give
any idea as to the quantity of carbonic oxide generally present
in tobacco smoke, as neither the temperature nor the barome-
trical pressure was noted, nor was any account taken of oxygen
and marsh gas."

NATURE
METEOROLOGY, ETC., IN MAURITIUS
THE following letter from Mr. C. Meldrum, dated
"Observatory, Mauritius, April 2," to a friend in
England, gives some interesting data tending to prove a
connection between solar activity and the state of the
weather. With his new instruments we may hope soon
to have some most important results.
"Since December last the colony has been suffering from
drought, and there is very little appearance of a favourable
change. February has been the driest month since systematic
observation commenced in 1852, and the rainfall for January
and March has been far below average. If the present state of
things continue long, the island will be hard up for witer.
'' Coincident with this drought there has been, as usual on such
occasions, a great falling off in the number and violence of
cyclones in the Indian Ocean. We copy here the log-books of
all vessels arriving in port from India, Australia, the Cape,
England, &c., so that no great storm can take place over the
greater part of the ocean without our getting more or less infor-
mation about it. Well, the hurricane season is nearly over, and
we have heard of only two storms, one on the 24th of January
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:46 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
away to the northward of us, and one on the 7th of March, away
to the eastward of us, and neither of them seems to have been
extensive or very violent, only two vessels having been involved
in each. The season thus bears a remarkable contrast to the
corresponding periods for 1871, '72, and '73, and furnishes another
instance of the now oft-observed fact that when Mauritius suffers
from drought the Indian Ocean is almost tree from hurricines.
The neighbouring island of Reunion has fared as badly as
Mauritius, and the log-books furnish evidence that the drought
has prevailed over a wide area.
"The S.E. trade-wind has been blowing from S.E.to E. and
E.N.E. almost without interruption during the last three months,
and the barometer been unusually high and steady for the season,
thus showing that from some cause or other the belt of calms and
variables between the S.E. trade and the N.W. monsoon has
not advanced so far to the south as it did in the years 1871-74.
"It is only now that I am enabled to keep a continuous record
of the sun-spots, the photo-heliograph having been put up a fort-
night ago, and being at work only for a week; but from obser-
vations made directly, as often as possible, it would appear that
there has been a great falling off in the number and magnitude
of the spots. If this is the case, then we have, as on many other
occasions, a decrease of spots, a decrease of cyclones, and a de-

Feb. 1.—Dr. Julius Ucke, of Samara, contributes an abstract of
his work, undertaken chiefly from a medical point of view, on the
quantitative proportions of atmospheric oxygen in different cli-
mates, in rtlation to temperature, moisture, and density of air.
The public have chosen certain localities as health-resorts long
before science pointed them out as eligible, and although we can-
not doubt that oxygen is a great healing power in these, the part
it really plays remains to be determined by physiologists and

pathologists. The present work merely opens the way to in-
quiry, and does not claim to go beyond the evidence of statistics.
Samara is a health-resort remarkable for the rarity of diseases of
respiration, but its climate is windy and not mild, and the changes
of temperature are great, both daily and seasonal. The conditions
of temperature, moisture, pressure, and wind, do not account for
i's healthiness. Two factors remain: oxygen and ozone. Oxy-
gen only concerns us at present. In order to find the relative
quantity of oxygen at any place, thermometric, barometric, and
hygrometric data are indispensable. Thirteen European and
three Indian towns and one American station were chosen.
Data for Nice, Algiers, and Madeira were wanting. Hearing in
mind the hygienic object of his task, Dr. Ucke takes as a measure
of the quantities of oxygen the number of inspirations of a grown
man in the course of a month of 30/42 days. In the absence of
a normal standard, the mean of the results for the seventeen
stations is used for comparison. He finds that in the whole year
most oxygen is inspired at Samara, least at Seringapatam; that,
taking all stations, the quantities arc largest in winter, least in
summer, except at Seringapatam, where spring gives the lowest
figure. Also, that generally the quantities decrease from E. to
W. These differences of course depend on the three factors, tem-
perature, density, and moisture. The first two have by far the
most considerable effect. The article is illustrated by various
tables.

It is possible to decide between the two modes of represent
ing the constitution of these compounds, if it be granted that the
variation in the specific volume of oxygen and sulphur is due to
the manner in which these elements are held in union. For il
the phosphorus in the oxychloride and thiochloride be quinquiva-

values, since both their combining units are united to the phos-

oxygen and sulphur must possess the smaller of the two values.
The author has determined the specific gravity, boiling-point,

to ascertain the specific volume of the oxygen and snlphur in the

genus are Rhodophyllum Craigianum, ./P. Slimonsanum, R. Phil-
lipsianum, R. Argylianum, A*, rcticulatum, and R. ellipticum.
Aspidiophyllum has the calice generally circular, shallow; the
septa forming thin lamina; for about half their length from
within, when they become flexuous, aud the columellar boss
prominent and helmet-shaped. The species are named A.
A'oninckianum, A. Iluxleyanum, A. cruciforme, A. derails, A.
Hentudii, A. Danai, A. dendrophyllum, A. ellipticum, A.Pagci,
A. scoticum, and A. laxum. The third genus, Kurnaliopkyllum,
is most nearly allied to Rhodophyllum, but has the columellar
space slightly raised above the inner margin of the primary
septa, and crowned by bending or wavy lamella.*, some of which
pass over the central space in sinuous folds. The species are

behaviour of air issuing from the side orifices of wind instru-
ments. These discrepancies deserve attention, and may be
accounted for by the laws of efflux. He showed that the stream
of air from the side hole of a clarionet was sufficient to extinguish
a candle, though the musical vibration was obviously in the
main tube. It is usual to tune such instruments by introducing a

resinous cement into the holes so as to diminish their calibre, but
after a certain point is reached the rounded surface thus obtained
ceases to produce an effect. If a short pipe of the same dia-
meter as the orifice be now inserted, auxiliary vibrations are set
up, and a definite note may be produced.. Dr. Stone was led
to inquire whether the theorem of D. Bernoulli, or the particular
part of it named after Toricelli, could be brought to bear on the
question. The vena contractu, which in fluids reduces the efflux
to 062 of the calculated amount, is also to be noticed in gases,
and the nature of the effluent column of air is affected by three
conditions: 1. The thickness of the wall in which the orifice is
made. 2. The shape of the nozzle. 3. Friction in a long pipe.
Some mathematical details were then given respecting these con-
ditions, and it was admitted that the vibration in a musical tube
must also exercise sensible influence. There are two functions in
a side orifice in an instrument; the first is to cut off a portion of
the tube, and by this means to raise the pitch; the second esta-
blishes a point of non-resistance in the wall of the tube, and
thus acts by influencing the longitudinal vibrations. In the organ
peculiar qualities of tone are often obtained by these side holes, as
in the "Viol di Gamba " and "keiaulophon " stops. In flutes,
oboes, clarionets, and other instruments, much of the tone comes
from the bell, even when the side holes are open. In instru-
ments in which the holes are long, as in the bassoon, the holes
themselves became sepaiate vibrating tubes. This was shown by
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
introducing tubes of different and increasing lengths, into an
orifice in the side of an organ reed pipe. The friction at last
became so great, and the secondary wave so strong, that the
organ pipe returned to its original pitch. A reed was also ap-
plied to a cylindrical tube, and it was shown that a sharp-edged
orifice opened at the middle point of the tube rendered it im-
possible to produce any note until a cylindrical nuzzle was intro-
duced, when the octave was suunded freely. The general results
proved that lateral holes had a double function, the pitch ol the
notes emittid varying with their size, shape, and length, the
actual severing of continuity in the principal tube being a com-
paratively minor point. Dr. Sione then iiistrted three tubes vary-
ing in length from two to six inches in a cylindrical tube like that
ol a clarionet, at right angles to its length, the longest being
placed at the the centre of the instrument, and the shortest at
one-eighth from the mouthpiece. The same note was produced
when each tube was used singly and when the three were em-
ployed, and Dr. Stone expressed a hope that a series of experi-
ments would render it possible to develop curves in which the
co> ordinates would be the lengths of the additional tubes and
their { osition in the instrument. He also considered that a new

LORD HARTISMERE'S VIVISECTION DILL
E Bill brought forward in the Upper House by
-*- Lord Hartismere for regulating the practice of
Vivisection deserves special attention on account of its
being the first important legislative attempt to restrict the
prosecution of physiological research.
It enacts that it shall not be lawful for anyone to per-
form a vivisection except in a place which is registered in
pursuance of the proposed Act, the registration being in
such form and under the management of such persons as
the Secretary of State shall appoint. The registration
certificate is lo be renewed once a year; it may be can-
celled at any time on its being proved that any provision
of the Act has been contravened, and the place registered
may be visited at any time by any inspector of anatomy.
Complete anaesthesia is compulsory, and curare is not to
be deemed to be an anaesthetic. The Secretary of State
may grant special licenses for the performance of vivisec-
tions in which anaesthetics are not employed; there shall
be paid in respect of every such license a sum not exceed-
ing ten pounds, and each license is to continue in force

for six months.
In the framing of this Bill there is a serious misrepre-
sentation of the true requirements of the case, The
source of error lies in the fact that it is taken for
granted that there is only a single class of physiological
workers. Such, however, is not the case; there are two
distinct classes, and although we agree with the tenor of
the Bill as far as one class is concerned, we arc certain
that it would so severely affect the other that its results
would be seriously [detrimental to the prosecution of physio-
logical research in this country.
Among ourselves there are several scientific men who
devote part of their life to the study of the problems of
the vital mechanism. Some do so from the inherent
interest of the subject; others from a desire to obtain a
further insight into pathology and disease generally. In
the course of their investigations it is now and then abso-
lutely essential for the completion of a line of argument,
or for the acquisition of the knowledge of the collateral
phenomena attending some previously recorded result,
that an experiment or experiments should be performed
on a living animal, Those whose mental development leads
them to conduct investigations of this character are fre-
quently peculiarly unwilling to do so in public institutions.
It is their spare minutes, when they are entirely their own

masters, that they employ in their favourite study. Are
they to be compelled, against their natural dispositionSj
either to obtain an official license for the performance of
these experiment on their own premises, or, as an alter-
native, conduct them in some previously specially licensed
establishment which is under the control of others? The
necessity for such a method of procedure would deter
many an excellent worker from commencing investiga-
tions which he recognises to be so much impeded by
lc%al restrictions. There might as well be a tax on
astronomers directing their telescopes to any special

bolder man than the writer of that memoir who should
affirm that no sound progress was made in geology by
him.
It is true enough, no doubt, as Prof. Geikie says, that
"he was not gifted with the philosophic spirit which
evolves broad laws and principles in science," and lie
therefore contributed nothing to this branch of geology.
It is strange, in fact, that when he did express any opinion
on debated theories—and he did so frequently with
vehemence—he generally took that side which the ad-
vance of science has condemned as untenable; so that
the only assistance he gave to theoretical geology was
that of affording the holders of any new theory the noto-
rious advantage of having some one to argue against.
He made no speculations himself, but only discussed
those of others. In fact, "he had the shrewdness to
know wherein his strength lay. Hence he seldom ven-
tured beyond the domain of fact, where his first suc-
cesses were won, and in which throughout his long life he
worked so hard and so well. In that domain he had few
equals." V

But for the observation of geological facts there is no
necessity for a universal acquaintance with science, how-
ever great an advantage such an acquaintance may be;
and this is proved by the successful labours of many a
field geologist—by the example of Wm. Smith, so often
called the Father of English Geology, who had no such
advantages, and by Murchison himself, as these pages of
I'rof. Geikie abundantly show.
Yet there arc qualities requisite for such work as Mur-
chison's, which are rarely so abundantly possessed as by
him ; they are, a keen perception of the really essential
features of a district, or, as Smith somewhat quaintly
expressed it, " a fine eye for a country ;" a power of corre-
lating apparently dissimilar objects ; and last, not least,
an untiring industry and perseverance that persist in pur-
suing an intricate subject until it is fully mastered. These
appear in all his work, and are well brought out in his
"Life."
Although the name of Murchison is now indissolubly
connected with Pateozoic rocks, he did not begin his
geological work among them, but among those easier
Secondary rocks in which the order and arrangement is
so much clearer. His first work, in 1S25, was a " Geo-
logical Sketch of the Nonh-western extremity of Sussex
and the adjoining parts of Hants and Surrey," which was

certainly up to the average geology of the time, and gave
promise of better things in the future. Indeed, when it
was thus seen that he had the ability, and intended to be
a worker in the science, he was elected to the secretaryship
of the Geological and fellowship of the Royal Society,
rather from the hope of what he would do than from
what he had done—and fortunately the hope was not dis-
appointed.
His next work was the determination of the age of the
coal-beds of Brora on the east coast of Scotland, in con-
nection with which he described those remarkable re-
mains of Secondary rocks so marvellously preserved on
both sides of Scotland, and which have lately been the
subject of such admirable and beautiful memoirs by Judd
and others.
The difficulties he found in understanding some of the
rocks he saw on this tour induced him to seek the co-
operation of Sedgwick, and thus commenced that long
and happy association of two great men, which, though
clouded for a time, cannot be said to have been entirely
broken up. We may mention here that these volumes

them Cambrian, and bidding Scdgwick, if he would retain
the latter name, to find some fossiliferous beds below.
This is followed by the complete dropping out of the
name in his " Russia ;" and when in after years a series
of Lower Fossiliferous beds -were found, Murchison still
sought to include them under the title of Silurian. It is
astonishing that Sedgwick should for so long have failed
to perceive the drift of these changes—and when he did
at length arouse himself he found half his Cambrian
system gone, and not unnaturally felt that his friend had
"stolen a march on him." Such appears from the data
afforded by this work to be the true account of this con-
troversy. In late years, however, chiefly owing to the
labours of Mr. Hicks, much new light has been thrown
on the succession of faunas in these earliest rocks, and
it has been shown that by no means the greatest break
in life occurs at the base of the Llandeilo rocks as de-
scribed by Murchison; and it is therefore probable that
the true limits of the two systems will have yet to be
re-adjusted under the light of the new facts. .

sical work so long as Geology is a science; it is undoubt-
edly Murchison's magnum opus, and it led directly to
those other researches by which he has also contributed
so much to our knowledge. Thus it was, on being told
that plants had been found in Silurian rocks in Devonshire,
that he persuaded Sedgwick to accompany him there,
when they found that the so-called Silurians were really of
Carboniferous age—but on what did they rest? on a series
of rocks with a peculiar assemblage of fossils, which gave
them great difficulty at first, but which at last they recog-
nised as a new system, the Devonian, with which they
boldly classed the Old Red Sandstone, though no com-
munity of fossils had yet been proved. This last step,
however, was fully justified, by Murchison's finding in
Russia the fishes of the one associated with the shells of
the other, and thus the Devonian system was settled on a
firm basis.
The received classification, however, of the Devonian
rocks was called in question by Prof. Jukes shortly before
his lamented death ; he assigned the greater part of them
to the Lower Carboniferous system, and Prof. Geikie con-
siders it to remain now an open question. He says:
"They who have given most attention to this part of
geology will probably most readily admit that, whether in
the way of contest or not, the question must be reopened;
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
that the accepted classification is far from being satisfac-
tory, and that Jukes did a great service by boldly attack-
ing it, and bringing to bear upon it all his long experience
in the south of Ireland, which gave him an advantage
possessed at the time by hardly anyone else." Whatever
controversy, however, there may be on the classification
of particular rocks, there can be no doubt that there is a
distinct epoch of life between the Carboniferous and
Silurian, and this Murchison and Sedgwick together first
defined and established.
It was for the study of the Silurian system, too, that
Murchison was led into Russia, and here it was that he
found that large development of rocks containing a special
fauna overlying the Carboniferous, to which he gave the
name of Permian, and which formed the subject of several
subsequent researches.
We are greatly indebted to Murchison for the introduc-
tion of good names into Geology. It was he who first
proposed the use of geographical terms, so happily illus-
trated in "Silurian," which introduce no theory and no
incongruity, such as is involved in calling rocks "transi-

Marsden's Numismata Oricntalia. A New Edition.
Part I. "Ancient Indian Weights." By Edward
Thomas, F.R.S. (London: Trubner and Co., 1874.)
THIS is the first part of a new edition of
"Marsden's Numismata Oricntalia," on an en-
larged scale, and is the reproduction of an essay
published some years ago. As it treats of the earliest
information that has come down to us of the system
of monetary weights in use amongst ancient Eastern
nations, it is considered as an appropriate introduction
to subsequent numbers, upon the coins of various Eastern
countries, to be contributed by other authors.
Mr. Thomas's essay is a work of considerable interest,
not only as regards the information contained in it re-

lating to ancient Indian weights and coins, but also for
its philological and ethnological information. The
earliest and most important authority cited is from the
Sanscrit text of the original code of Hindu law by Manu,
the exact date of which is undetermined. Although por-
tions of it are assigned by some authorities between the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries B.C., yet the body of the
compilation is more generally referred to a period about
400 B.C.
The Indian weights mentioned in the Code of
Manu were those of Central India, south of the Hima-
layas, and comprised between the rivers Indus and
Ganges. They were in use after the occupation of this
country by the Aryans, whose invasion from the north-
west is referred to a period as early as 1600 B.C. Mr.
Thomas, however, claims a still earlier origin for this
system of ancient Indian weights, and that they were
already in use before the Vedic Aryans entered India.
The old system appears to have been based on the weight
of native seeds. The principal unit was the Rati, the
seed of the wild liquorice plant. A second unit or stan-
dard of weight is stated to have been the Mdsha, a small
wild bean, which is also mentioned in the Code of Manu
as a food grain. The following tables of monetary weight
are taken from the ancient record, and include the smaller

seed-grain weights, which, in the original Sanscrit text,
are made to originate and lead up to the larger weights in
metal, together with the smaller sub-divisions of the seed-
grain unit. Their equivalent weight in Troy grains is
given by Mr. Thomas as computed from the mean of
experimental weighings of the several seeds, and as con-
firmed from the ascertained weights of less ancient
Indian coins.

cubit of I7'5 inches, divided into twenty-four digits, is also
almost identical with the ancient Egyptian natural cubit
of six palms and twenty-four digits. But it appears to be
now impossible to determine whether these Indian units
were derived from the Egyptian, or both from an earlier
common source ; although we may fairly assume that this
natural cubit was of the same length as that used by Noah
before the Deluge. Mr. Thomas's hypothesis of the
lesser Indian unit of weight and of length, and of the
scale of multiples and parts, is, however, probably cor-
rect, as being derived from natural and local sources.

menades de Paris," by the author of the book now
before us, is a costly \vork, known to comparatively few
people in this country. We presume that the present
volume is regarded as an appendix or supplement to the
work named, otherwise we cannot account for the publi-
cation of what is little more than a catalogue of names in
so unwieldy a form.
An enumeration of the plants grown for the embellish-
ment of the parks and gardens of Paris, in a handy
octavo form, would be welcome to almost every lover of
horticulture; but the object of the compiler of the
"Arboretum et Fleuriste " was doubtless such as we have
indicated. It is printed on one side of the paper only,
and the matter arranged in columns, giving the names,
native countries, soil, use, height, form of leaves, colour
of flowers, &c., of the various plants. As a horticultural
catalogue the work is fairly well executed, but, like most
gardening books, it contains errors that have been copied
from book to book, though they were cleared up long ago.
In the first part of the work the author has indulged in an
attempt to introduce a reform in botanical nomenclature;
why it was not carried through we are not told, probably
for the reason that, however desirable reformation may
be, this one would scarcely receive any support from
botanists. It consists in giving all substantive specific

names an adjectival form, and, a less justifiable act, cf
changing the terminations of good Latin names. Thus,
for. example, Pinus Coultt'rii, Harlv.'fg'ii, and fcnslii,
become P. Coultfrca, Hai'twe^ta, &c. Objections might
be urged against this course; but why should we change
lienthaniiana and kindred names into licnthamca? And
Pinus infipsca for P. inops is quite inadmissible.
The information under the several headings is usually
not inaccurate, but somewhat loose. Thus, under the
genus Magnolia, Pennsylvania is given as the native
country ot M. acumiiuita, Carolina of auricnlata, Vir-
ginia of glauca, and so on; whereas these trees have a
much wider range of distribution. Again, under Crata:-
gus coccinca, we are told that the specific name indicates
scarlet flowers; but the flowers are white, and the fruit
scarlet. But as it is not a botanical work, it is scarcely
fair to criticise it by a botanical standard, though it is
scarcely excusable to give North Africa as the native
country' of Calla sEtlucpica, New Zealand of Caladiiim
esculenliim, &c. Libocedrus decurrens is referred to
Thuja gigantea, and the true T. qigantca to T. Alcnzitsii;

man. In my own garden, where I have had standing always
from ten to fifty swarms, and over which I thought I was watch-
ing with almost a fatherly affection, I have learned how utterly
selfish I was in looking forward to autumn, when, by the destruc-
tion of the industrious and unselfish bees, I could lay in for my
own consumption what they had so laboriously gathered in the
summer to sustain each other through the winter. I learned,
from their unselfishness, to divide with them, always leaving
enough to sustain the colony till the spring should again bring
the flowers.
I think, too, that both Sir John I.ubbock and your corre-
spondent are mistaken as to the object of beating pans, sounding
horns, and making other hideous noises in hiving bees. The
object is not, as Sir John intimates, originally to drive away evil
spirits, or to assert ownership, as indicated by Mr. Renshaw. It
is simply, as everyone knows who ever thumped on a pan,
sounded a horn, or yelled through a speaking trumpet on such
an occasion, to drown the voice of the queen or guides who are
to conduct the swarm to the new home which members of the
community who had been sent out, as the Israelites sent forward
Joshua and others, had found for them.

Flowering of the Hazel
It was with great interest that I read the communication from
F. D. Wetterhan, in Nature, vol. xi. p. 507. But I cannot
help expressing quite a different opinion as to the bearing of
the interesting lact that proterandrous and protero^ynous indi-
viduals are to be found in the same locality. From the stiucture
of the flowers and fiom insects never visiting the stigmas, I am
convinced that the hazel is a strictly anemophilous plant; that
the red colour of its stigmas is solely an effect of chemical pro-
cesses connected with the development of the female flowers to
maturity, just in the same manner as in the female flowers of
the larch-tree and some other Conifersc ; and that likewise the
coexistence of proterandrous and proterogynous individuals in
the hazel relates solely 10 the influence of the wind, and not at
all to the agency of insects.
Whilst in Piimula, Pulmonaria, and many other entomnphilous
plants, so admirably treated of by Charles Darwin, two kinds
of individuals, viz., long-styled and short-styled ones, have origi-
nated from the positions of the anthers and the stigmas diverging
in different individuals in opposite directions—among the anemo-
philous plants in Juglans rcgia' and Corylus aivllatia, among
the cntomophtlous ones in Sytinga vulgaris^ and Veronica
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
sj>icata,% two kinds of individuals, namely, proterandrous and
pioterogynous ones, have originated from the periods of develop-
ment of the anthers and stigmas diverging in different individuals
in opposite directions. The effect in the two contrivances has
been the same, cross-fertilisation not only between different
flowers, but also between different branches, having become indis-
pensable.
In dimorphous species, this cross-fertilisation, as is known, is
effected by the visiting insects touching with the same part of their
body the anthers of the long-styled and the stigmas of the short-
jtyled form; and with some other part of their body the anthers
uf the short-styled and the stigmas of the long-styled form. This
kind of intercrossing can apparently never be effected by the
wind ; whence long-styled and short-styled (dimorphous) species
are never to be found among ancmophilous plants. But in these
the coexistence of proterandrous and pioterogynous individuals
produces the same effect, the pollen-grains of the proteran-
drous individuals, of course, being transported by the wind only
to the stigmas ol the proterogynous ones, and vice versd.

Atlas as a 67 ; but after searching through the modern
catalogues where it was likely to be included, we have
only discovered a single meridian observation by Lamont
in his Zone 314, on 1845, April 5, when it is called 7-8.
It does not occur in Argelander's " Uranometria," nor
was it observed by D'Agelet, Bessel, or Santini.—Another
of Lalande's stars, No. 23726 in Corvus, is in all proba-
bility variable. He estimated it 7^, 1795, May 10, and
Bessel in May 1824 called it 8; Heis, however, saw it as
a fifth magnitude. What is the actual degree of bright-
ness? The star's position for the commencement of the
present year is in R.A. 12I1. 37m. 2s., and N.P.D.
103° io'-3.
The Star 61 Geminorum.—The Rev. T. W. Webb
has remarked the probable variability of a small com-
panion of this star, distant about 1', and not far from the
circle of declination to the south (estimated angles from
1600 to 1900), and appears inclined to identify it with
Smyth's companion of the 9th magnitude, for which he'
gave, i835'85, position no0-o, distance 60". Smyth's esti- .
mates of magnitude down to 9 may be generally relied j
upon, though for smaller stars he is often wide of the
mark, according to our present standard. It is very pos-
sible that he may have caught one of the minor planets
close to 61 Geminorum ; his angle, though it has only his

lowest weight, differs considerably from recent estimations
for the faint star. Our principal object in referring to the
Rev. T. W. Webb's remarks is, however, to suggest that
61 Geminorum may be itself variable; D'Agelet con- j
sidered it 6 in October 1784. Piazzi observed it ten times .
on the meridian, and estimated it 7"8 ; it is 7 in Lalande, I
67 in Taylor's volume for 1834-35, 6 in the " Urano- \
metria"and Heis's Catalogue, 6-5 in "Durchmusterung,"
and 6"3 in the Radcliffe Observations, 1870. The deep
yellow colour noticed by Smyth, and now stated to have
disappeared, may perhaps be considered by some readers
as an indication in the same direction.
Cometary Astronomy.—The Asiron. Nach., No.

comet discovered by Coggia, 1874, August 19, taken at
the newly-erected observatory of Col. Tomline, Orwell

Blyth after Mr. Schomburgh, the brow antler is long,
whilst each of the two branches of the short beam again
divides in a very regular manner, the ultimate tynes being
of nearly equal length. In Duvaucel's Deer, from India,
the beam is longer than in the last-named species, and
the branching is very similar, except that the posterior
bifurcation is less developed than the anterior. This
reduction is carried to an extreme in Eld's Deer, from
Eastern India, where the anterior division of the antler is
very large and curved forward, whilst the posterior is
represented by a minute tyne. The gradation between
these three forms was demonstrated by Mr. Blyth. In
the Reindeer the general conformation of the beam very
closely resembles that of Eld's Deer, but with this rusine
peculiarity, the strangely palmated brow antler is double,
as only elsewhere occurs in the elaphme type. In the
American Roes a similar conformation obtains, the brow
antler being small in the Virginian Deer and almost
absent in the Mule Deer, which latter species in the

branching of the beam very closely agrees with both
Duvaucel's and Schomburgh's Deer.
The South American Guazupucu (Blastocerm palu-
liosns), which differs considerably from the Mazame, a
species generally supposed to belong to the same genus,
has the anterior bifurcated tyne. This may be the modi-
fied brow antler, as may be the similar branch in the
Chinese Elaphure discovered by the Pere A. David, both
these species having a simple, or comparatively simple,
posterior beam, and no gland on the outer side of the
metatarsus. , ,
The interpretation of the affinities of the Roebuck by
means of its horns is not easy. In that species there are
three small tynes. the anterior being situated higher up than
is usually the case with brow antlers, and the two posterior
much like those of the Hog Deer. In the last-named
species, however, the brow antler is not low, and it is not
difficult to imagine it being carried a little further up. On
this assumption the Roebuck is the only European repre-
sentative of the rusine type.
The simple nature of the antlers in the Brockets of
South America and the peculiar Muntjacs of the Indian
region, in which the horns are attached on the top
of elongated pedestals, makes it impossible to decide,
from them alone, the forms to which they are nearest

As far as the hornless Musk and Water Deer are con-
cerned, Sir V. Brooke has shown in how many points
they differ from one another ; whilst Prof. Flower, at a
recent meeting of the Society, has demonstrated to a cer-
tainty that the former of them is not at all related to the
Chevrotains, which they so closely resemble in size and
general contour, and with which they have generally been
associated.
The horns of the Elk do not agree with any of the
above-described forms. The fan-shaped palmation into
which they spread is based on a radiating framework, and
no specialised brow antler is to be seen.
With reference to the geographical distribution of the
Deer, none arc to be found in the Australian or Ethiopian
region, the Barbary Deer being the only member of the
group found in Africa at all, and that north of the Sahara.

named ore was contained in the range of veins occu-
pying a length of some thirty miles in Somerset and North
Devon, from the Raleigh's Cross westward to near Ilfra-
combe. Proceeding next to show the relationship be-

of ore having the appearance of chalybite or spathic
ore, being covered with the large rhombohedral crystals
characteristic of that species, but which the presence
of the brown streak and of water and the percentage
of iron proved to have been turned into brown ore.
A fragment from the lodes of the Deerpark in Exmoor,
next shown, had also lost its carbonic acid, had acquired
oxygen and water, and actually become a different
substance. It had been argued that the change com-
menced with the formation of the more hydrated species,
and passed through successive stages to those with
the least amount of water; but on that point evi-
dence was as yet defective. The brown ores were un-
doubtedly (for the process might be watched in the
workings) formed by another series of changes from

pyrites through the sulphate of iron. The crystals of
brown ore, in the form of pyrites, were among the best
known pseudomorphs, and there were localities which
invited the inference that this action had taken place
on an important scale. Mr. Smyth, in concluding,
said he would not, in the present brief sketch, venture
upon the vexed question of the original deposition of the
great northern masses of haematite, although strong
aiguments for their having been chalybite might be
adduced from the occurrence of limestone fossils turned
into red ore. He brought under notice another change
of condition among the oxides of iron. It was a signifi-
cant fact that magnetite was characteristic of the older
formations—of those bodies of rock which had during the
longest period of time been exposed to the influences
which bring about metamorphosis and change of sub-
stance. In the Perran lode small portions of magnetite
had been formed among the brown ores near the surface.
In some of the Cornish copper lodes specimens of mag-
netic ore had occurred which looked very much as if they
had been carbonates, and amongst the beautiful red ores
of Siegen small grains of magnetite appeared to testify to
a partial change, while there appeared to be sufficient
grounds for believing that, in many cases at least, this
last change in the degree of oxidation might be produced

The rapid sequence of currents passed into the line-

from contact. Thus contact with the paper will produce
marks, either dot or dash, according as the inking con-
tact is either momentary or of a sensible duration; the
contrary movement producing the spacing between the
printed marks. Now, as the currents from the Jacquard
ribbon (Fig. 20) are passed at equal intervals and in
alternate directions, the spacings between the signals will
be automatically regular; the "dash" being the effect
of the retention of the magnetic armature acting on the
inking disc for double the time of the "dot ",by reason of |
the grouping of the perforations to form the " dash," giving
a longer duration without a reversal of the current being
passed into the circuit. The arrangement for supplying
ink to the little revolving inking disc is simple and effec-
tive. A metal wheel, having its edge cut into a V shape,
is kept revolving in a dish of ink, and by capillary attrac- j
tion this V groove is kept constantly filled with ink,
and thus the periphery of the little inking disc which
revolves in this groove of ink is without any rubbing
friction kept constantly supplied with the proper amount
of ink to continuously record the rapid motion of the

armature as the currents flow from the transmitter into
the wire. It is by these very simple means that Wheat-
stone his produced his high-speed printer, at once an
accurate recorder and a telegraphic necessity in these
days of special press-transmissions to the chief com-
mercial centres of the United Kingdom.
In order to realise the great value of the automatic
high-speed system upon extended lines of telegraphic
transmissions, it is only necessary to compare the speed
of the Morse apparatus on lines of a given length with
that of the automatic electric Jacquard weaver. With an
apparatus containing such celerity of transmission and
recording powers, it becomes necessary to adopt a special
system for the despatch and receipt of intelligence; to
economise manual labour, and utilise the capacity of the
wire to the greatest extent. Messages are therefore passed
into the machine for transmission along the wire in groups;
that is to say, on a circuit of 300 miles in length, twelve
messages will be perforated upon a continuous ribbon and
sent through the "transmitter" at the same time, and
vice versii. Employing a wire of a capacity known as

received, in an hour; equivalent to eighty-four messages
of thirty words each, and with the average of five letters
to a word, a total of 12,600 letters, or an average of 210
letters per minute, equivalent to forty-two words per
minute, with all the necessary formalities and acknow-
ledgments in addition. Such a speed may be maintained
in moderately fine weather, and requires a staff of five
clerks at both the receiving and transmitting stations;
namely, two for perforating the messages on to the paper
ribbon, two for writing or translating, and one for the
working of the apparatus in sending acknowledgments
and signals for repetitions, &c. When dealing with
parliamentary and newspaper despatches, a much higher
speed can be obtained, first because there is no neces-
sity for grouping the messages, and secondly because, as
a rule, the transmissions are only in one direction,
either as wholly received or forwarded messages, which
circumstances greatly reduce the initial delay in the
transmission. With a No. 4 wire gauge between Aber-
deen and London, forty words may be reached, and with
a No. 6 wire between Edinburgh and London fifty words,

element in the commercial value of all high-speed arrange-
ments, when the speed is beyond that of the public
requirements of the circuit.
Alexander Bain's chemical printing telegraph, invented
in 1846, of which this American automatic machine is
only a modernised adaptation, is shown at Fig. 25. It
combined methods of arranging, transmitting, and re-
ceiving electrical telegraph communications, in which
mechanically- composed communications were trans-
mitted through electric circuits, and received by che-
mically prepared surfaces, both apparatus being kept
in motion by mechanical means, without the aid of
magnets. The apparatus consisted of a frame con-
taining a driving power by which a rotatory motion
was imparted to the metal drum B, placed in connection
with the earth by means of the contact springs E E. The
paper strip p p, chemically prepared by being immersed
in a solution of sulphuric acid and prussiate of potass to
receive the sequence of currents transmitted through the
wire from the "transmitter," is wound upon the drum A,
and is drawn forward over the revolving earth contact B

at a uniform speed by reason of the pressure of the break
roller M, which may, whenever the paper is not required
to advance, be withdrawn by the lever H working on the
centre R, and kept in position either way by the action of
the spring roller w. An insulated metallic style D, in
connection with the line wire f, and furnished with the
necessary screw adjustments a, b, c, is arranged to press
uniformly upon the chemically-prepared paper as it passes
over the earth drum B. The style D can also be removed
from pressing contact with the paper ribbon when re-
quired, as indicated by the dotted outline. When there-
fore the style D is passing over the surface of the prepared
paper, and electric currents are passed through the line
wireyfrom the distant station, the electric circuit will be
completed through the paper ribbon P, and the metallic
drum B, with the earth E, and in the passage of the current,
the iron in the chemical solution is decomposed and a dark
blue mark becomes visible upon the paper corresponding
in length to the duration of the current; so that if the
Jacquard ribbon at the distant station is perforated into
the necessary length of holes to represent the sequences
of dots and dashes in the Morse code, to form letters and
words, the chemical decomposition from the style D
will be an accurate replica of the distant message in the
"dot" and "dash" symbols. It was thus that in 1846

Alexander Bain, the clever and ingenious Edinburgh

is scarcely understood, and which in all probability is left
to American skill to develop. Its extreme simplicity
and wonderful chemical sensibility speak volumes in its

Prof. James Dewar, in resigning his post of Chemist to
the Highland Agricultural Society, on his appointment to the
Jacksonian Chair, Cambridge, has told that Society some whole-
some truths, which we hope they will take to heart. Mr. Dewar
writes :—"After what has occurred, it will hardly be necessary
for me to say anything about what might have been had the
chemical department been rearranged in the way I naturally
anticipated after the death of Dr. Anderson. You are aware I
intended prosecuting investigations in vegetable physiology, had
the proper means been placed at my disposal ; and the desire to
do so was the main reason of my leaving the University. As it
seems, however, the opinion of a portion of the Society that an
agricultural chemist (so-called by the uninitiated, because his
business is chemical analyses and the manipulating of the farming
interests) rather than a scientific chemist would be best qualified
to discharge the duties of the office of chemist, I have considered
it my duty to accept the Cambridge Professorship as the best
means of getting out of a false position. I still trust, however,

the Society will ultimately see that this office of chemist will
never be properly filled except by one thoroughly trained in
scientific research, and this, the making him a real agricultural
chemist, will depend on the means placed at his disposal for
applying his scientific knowledge to agriculture."

of Problems in Thermal Conduction." Cooling of a cylinder
to be worked out numerically in one or more cases : cooling of a
globe may be illustrated experimentally in one or more cases. All

It is with great regret that we record the death, in his fifty,
fourth year, of Admiral Sherard Osborn, C.B., F.R.S., which
took place suddenly on Thursday night last. Admiral Osborn's
name is well known in connection with Arctic exploration,
and he was to have read a paper last Monday on the Arctic
Expedition before the Royal Geographical Society. He was
born April 25, 1822, entered the navy in 1S37, and served in
the East Indies and in China. He obtained his commission as
lieutenant in 1846, and three years later was selected as a
volunteer for the Arctic Expedition, under Capt. H. T. Austen,
sent in search of Sir John Franklin, being appointed to com>
mand the Pioneer. He afterwards served with distinction
during the Russian war, in China, and in Mexico. In 1864
Capt. Osbom was appointed to the command of the turret-ship
Royal Sovereign, and was afterwards for several years managing
director of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway at Bombay.
Admiral Osborn naturally took a keen interest in the Arctic
Expedition which is so soon to leave our shores.

IN the appendix to the United States Coast Survey Report
for 1872, now in the press, is a report by Mr. W. H. Ball on the
tides, currents, and meteorology of the Eastern Aleutian region
and the North-east Pacific, accompanied by explanatory dia-
grams. Mr. Dall's observations on the oceanic currents, which
are here tabulated and discussed up to the date of the report,
are of special interest as being the first series undertaken with a
direct view to the solution of the problems in question, and
result in the proof of the existence of a rellexed northerly arm of
the great easterly North Pacific current, denominated by him the
Alaska current, which had previously been surmised from iso-
lated observations and theoretical considerations. Mr. Dall has
been enabled to determine the rate and dimensions of several
portions of this current, and maximum, minimum, and mean
annual temperature. The exijtence of definite oceanic currents
in the eastern half of Behring Sea is shown to be very doubtful.
Some important generalisations on the relations of the Pacific
and Behring Sea tides to each other are made, and the peculiari-
ties of the compound tides of this region are graphically indicated
by diagrams in a new method, original with the author, and pos-
sessing some interest for those studying these problems. The
report is accompanied by numerous hydrographic memoranda
and tables of meteorological, current, and tidal observations.

Rising from the top of the battery is a light brass stem, like a

little bell, within which the two "poles" of the battery are
united by a spiral of platinum wire; this wire, when the battery
is put in action by the immersion of the zinc plate, becomes
white hot, and will instantly ignite the gas if held over the open
burner. The name which the maker, Mr. Horatio Yeates, has

anything had begun to come out. The Prin^lea was far advanced
in bud, barely commencing to blossom. The Aetna was just
beginning to burst into leaf. About the first week in November
Festuca Cookii came out, and a few days Inter Azorella selago.
The young fronds of the ferns were just about to unroll. In the
third week of the same month Montiafonlana and Aetna affinis
were in flower in a sheltered spot, and Lcptinella plumosa was
first found in blossom. Galium antarcticur.i r.ppeared about the
same date. A week later, Ranunculus hydrophilus and a
Festuca [purpurascens ?) were out, and Lycopo-iium clavatum was
sprouting. By the middle of the month Jriodia and Lyallia
kerguelensis and also Ranunculus crassipes were in flower; the
Pringlea was everywhere past flowering (excepting upon the
mountains), and Aira antarclUa began to:hoot forth its panicles.
Before the end of the month a Carcx cam; out; but Bu'.Uarda
and other plants delayed still.
A few species of Mammals have been introduced into the
island. Mice (evidently A/us musculus, L ) are common along
the coast, and have been found by us in various places. The
rabbits, transported by order of the Admital.'y from the convict
settlement in Table Bay, have been landed by H.M.S. Valage in

Royal Sound. They share with the birds hjles of the petrels,
and are (it is almost superfluous to mention) propagating freely.
Their favourite food is the Acitna; but 1' ey occasionally eat
Pringlea leaves and gnaw away the green surface of Azorella.
In the Crozettes, whose climate and flora are said to resemble
those of this island, rabbits have become extremely abundant,
and so rank and coarse that the sealers will not eat them.
Goats are increasing in numbers on the lee.\ard side of the main
land.
Whales and porpoises occasionally en cr the Sound. Old
skulls of the latter, wanting the lower jaw, are cast up here and
there on the beaches.
Up to the present time I have captured only two species of
seals—a female sea leopard and two males of a Platyrliine Seal.
The other kinds frequent the more open parts of the coast and
islands.
Twenty-two species of birds, at the fewest, perhaps twenty-
three, frequent Royal Sound, viz., a Chionis, a Cormorant, a
Teal, a Tern, a Gull, a Skua, eleven (perhaps twelve) Petrels,
two Albatrosses, and three (perhaps four) 1'enguins. Of these, I
have procured eggs of the first six ; also of six Petrels, one Alba-
tross, and two Penguins. The Thalassidroma are preparing for
laying.
Fish are rather scarce in Oo»ervatory Hay. Only three
species have hitherto occurred to us, two of which are common

under stones at low water. The remains of a Raia have also
been picked up on one of the islands by an officer of the Volage,
but hardly sufficient is left to enable the species to be determined.
It is allied to R. clavata and R. radiata.
The entomology of the island is very interesting. Most of the
larger insects seem to be incapable of flight. 1 have found re-
presentatives of the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera,
and Colembola.
The Lepidoptera comprise a species of the Noctuina (as I
suppose) and one of the 'Iineina. Of the first I have not yet
reared the imago; the larva is a moss tater and subterranean:
the adult is probably as large as an Agrolis of medium size. The
species of Iineina is probably one of the Gelechidce, judging from
the form of the palpi. Its larva feeds on young shoots of Festuca:,
and sometimes spins a silken cocoon for the pupa. The imago,
of which the sexes are alike, has acute and very abbreviated
wings, and the posterior pair extremely minute. In repose the
antenna are widely separated, and almost divaricate. When the
sun shines the adult is active, and, if alarmed, jumps to a distance
of two or three inches at a time. During its passage through the
air the wings are vibrated.

the difficulty to obtain the compounds of these metals in a pure

and in these of didymium and lanthanum belonged to the first
or second metal in the pair; the state of these questions in 1S68
was, that there were twelve lines which always appeared when
yttrium or erbium were examined, and sixteen lines in the case
of didymium and lanthanum. Prof. Thalen succeeded in ob-
taining sufficient quantities of compounds of each of the metals,
from M. Cleve, Professor of Chemistry at the Upsala University,
and these were of undoubted purity. He was thus enabled to
study their spectra most accurately, and the following table

Genera: Thoraeasaurus, Holops, and recent forms.
The Mesosuchia are intermediate in character between the
other two groups; the Parasuchia, where they differ from the
Mesosuchia, approach the Ornlthoscelida and Lacertilia, espe-
cially such as Halleria and Hyperodapedon, with amphica-lous
vertebral centra. The Eusuchia, on the other hand, are the
Crocodilia which depart most widely from the Ornithoscelida
and Lacertilia, and are the most Crocodilian of crocodiles.
After indicating at some length the succession of modifications
in the above three groups, the author remarked that if there is
any solid ground tor the doctrine of evolution, the Eusuchia
ought to be developed from the Mesosuchia, and these from the
Parasuchia, and showed that geological evidence proved that the
three groups made their appearance in order of time, in accord-
ance with this view. Thus, in the Trias there are the genera Relo-
don and Stagonolepis of the sub-order Parasuchia. In the Upper
Lias we have Steneosaurus (A/ystriosaurus) and Pelagosanrus, the
first represented also in all Mesozoic formations up to the Kim-
meridgc Clay; in the Fuller's Earth Teleosaurus and Teleido-
saurus occur; in the Kelloway Rock Metriorhynchus, also met
with in the Oxford Clay and Kimmcridge Clay ; in the Wealden,
Goniotholis, Macrorhynehus, Pholidosanrus, and unnamed Teleo-
saurians ; and in the Upper Chalk, Hyposaurus; all belonging
to the Mesosuchia. In the Upper Chalk, again, the Eusuchia
make their appearance, represented by the genera T/ioraeosaurus,

Ilolops, and Gavialis (?). How far back the Parasuchia extend
in time is not known, but they are not found in any formation
subsequent to the Upper Trias. The author described a frag-
ment of a skull of a \vcaldcn crocodile, in which the posterior
nares are smaller and situated further back than in Metriorhyn-
chus or Steneosaurus. Of the nearest allies of the Crocodilia,
the Lacertilia and Ornithoscelida, the former may be traced back
from the present day to the Permian epoch, and the latter from
the later Cretaceous to the Triassic epoch. The author discussed
the question whether these types exhibit any evidence of a similar
form of evolution to that of the Crocodilia. The cranial struc-
ture of the Permian Lacertilia is almost unknown, and the only
important deviation from the type of the existing Lacertilia in
the skeleton is that their vertebra; arc amphiccelous, not precoc-
ious. With this exception there is no evidence that the Lacer-
tilian type of structure has undergone any important change
from later Paleozoic times to the present day; and this change
seems to have occurred earlier in the Lacertilia than in the cro-
codiles, as a sacral vertebra of a lizard from the Purbecks has
the centrum concave in front and convex behind. With regard
to the Ornithoscelida, the author noticed that the researches of

friction of ice upon ice enormous. Friction is dependent upon
pressure and distance moved, and independent of velocity of
motion.

The Malagasy appeared to be a single race. No tribe is to be
found secluded in any corner or in the hill districts different from
the people of the plains or open provinces such as is met with in
India, in Sumatra, and in Borneo ; nor is any portion of the people
specially degraded. The Malagasy are divided into tin-" t.ibes—
the Betsimisarakas, the Sacalavas, and the Hovas, the latter
largely predominating in numbers and influence. With regard
to the origin of the people, the author rejected the theory cf
Crawfurd and others, who argued for their African descent.
Their language and tribal customs suggested a very different
origin. There could hardly be any doubt that the Malay entered
largely into the composition of the grammar and vocabulary,
and continued researches into the Malay and Malagasy languages
gave more and more evidence of their resemblances. The con-

less.—The Master of St. Catharine's College remarked that a

THE UNSEEN UNIVERSE
The Unseen Universe; or, Physical Speculations on a
Future State. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1875.)
THIS book, which rumour attributes to a co-partnery
of two distinguished physicists, will at least serve
to prove one thing, that scientific men are not necessarily
unbelievers, and that some scientific men accept frankly
and fully the whole of what is generally understood as
the scheme of Trinitarian Christianity, and find in it the
most adequate expression of their own physical specu-
lations. Whether their readers agree with or differ from
the authors, they cannot fail to recognise the extent of their
information and the freedom of their reasoning. There
is no attempt to make anything square with preconceived
theories, and although we doubt whether the writers
would have arrived at their conclusions without the
accepted scheme of orthodox Christianity to serve them
as a clue, it is equally clear that they rest them on what
they think adequate scientific evidence.
The preliminary chapter states the fact of the all
but universal belief in, or aspiration after, Immortality.
It admits that that doctrine is inconsistent with the

doctrine of continuity as generally - understood and
as applied solely to the visible universe. It accepts
and explains the principle of continuity in the fullest
sense, and it attempts to reconcile it, as thus apprehended,
with the doctrine of immortality. Incidentally—out of
the apparent waste of energy on space, and on other
indications chiefly teleological—it constructs a hypothesis
of an invisible universe, perhaps developed out of
another invisible universe, and so on ad infinitum.
It is another consequence of the theory that our natural
bodies are probably accompanied by a sort of invisible
framework or spiritual body, and that the phosphorus
and other substances of which the natural body is
built up are not really identical with these elements in
their ordinary condition of inorganic atoms, but are some-
how transubstantiated by the co-existence, along with
the mere chemical substance or with its chemical pro-
perties, of this invisible, imponderable, immaterial, accom-
panying essence, which derives a kind of vis vivida from
a connection with the unseen universe. The passage
from the visible universe to the invisible seems to be made
intelligible to the authors by the existence of the ether, a
substance into which energy is continually being passed,
and into which it is perpetually, and, so far as any obvious
or sensible effect is concerned, finally, absorbed.

As a first postulate the authors assume the existence of
a Creator. Finite beings, creatures, are conditioned by
the laws of the universe, and it is in these conditions that
we must seek to discover its nature. The first pair of
subjects for human thought are matter and mind, and the
materialists tell us, that whereas mind or mental activity
never exists without being associated with some forms of
matter, we may perfectly conceive matter, as for instance
a block of wood or a bar of iron, existing without intelli-
gence. Is mind then the dependant—is there nothing in
matter which serves as the vehicle of intelligence different
from all other matter? The authors answer that we have

no right to assume that the brain consists of particles of
phosphorus or carbon such as we know these substances
chemically, that we cannot say that there may not be
something superadded to their chemical and physical
qualities. They dwell upon another fact—the fact that
individual consciousness returns after sleep or trance; a
fact inferring some continuous existence. The assump-
tions of the materialist are less inevitable than he supposes.

work. There is indeed a sort of wild and far-off possi-
bility by which a little more work might be got out of a
uniform temperature universe, if we could suppose Clerk-
Maxwell's demons—"mere guidance applied by human
intelligence"—occupied in separating those particles of a
heated gas which are moving faster than the average
from those which are moving slower. But this is but a
broken reed to trust, and it would at the best avail us
little. What must happen in the existing physical system
would be this: the earth, the planets, the sun, the
stars, are gradually cooling; but infinitely numerous cata-
strophes by which the enormous existing store of energy
of position may be drawn upon, may over and over again
restore unequal temperature. The fall together, from the
distance of Sirius, of the sun and another equal sun would
supply the former with at least thirty times as much
energy as can have been obtained by the condensation of
his materials out of a practically infinite nebulous mass of
stones or dust. But these catastrophes can only delay the
inevitable. If the existing physical universe be finite—and

bility that it may not be so—the end must come, unless
there be an invisible universe to supplement and con-
tinue it.
What is the ultimate nature of matter, and especially
of the ether, which is the vehicle of all the energy we
receive from the sun? There have been four theories,
for each of which something may be said. There is the
Lucretian theory of an original, indivisible, infinitely hard
atom, "strong in solid singleness;" Boscovich's theory
that the atom or unit is a mere centre of force; the
theory that matter, instead of being atomic, is infinitely
divisible, practically continuous, intensely heteroge-
neous; and, finally, the theory of the vortex atom, a
thing not infinitely hard and therefore indivisible, but infi-
nitely mobile, so that it] escapes all force which makes
effort to divide it. What we call matter may thus consist
of the rotating portions of a perfect fluid, which con-
tinuously fills space. Should this fluid exist, there must
be a creative act for the destruction or production of the
smallest portion of matter. Whichever of these theories
we adopt, we must explain the simplest affection of
matter-that by which it attracts other matter. There
seems little possibility of doing so. The most plausible
explanation is in Le Sage's assumption of ultramundane
corpuscles, infinite in number, excessively small in size,
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
flying about with enormous velocities in all directions.
These particles must move with perfect freedom among
the particles of ordinary matter, and if they do so we can
understand how, through the existence of the ultramun-
dane particles, two mundane particles attract inversely as
the square of the distance. On this theory the energy of
position is only the energy of motion of ultramundane
and invisible particles—and a bridge is built between the
seen and the unseen. These ultramundane particles are
something far more completely removed from all possi-
bility of sensible qualities than the ether which Sir
William Thomson has attempted to weigh. Struve has
speculated upon the possibility that it is not infinitely
transparent to light, and his calculations, based on the
numbers of stars of each visible magnitude, lead him to
suppose that some portion of .the light and energy from
distant suns and planets may be absorbed in it. The
ether is thus a kind of adumbration or foretaste of the
invisible world. It may have certain of the properties of
that world which is perceived by sense, but it is probably
subject only to a few of the physical conditions of ordinary

change affecting the matter of the brain is all that i
needed to set him in motion. May not other beings be
capable of touching what we may call the hair-triggers
of the universe? Whatever these agencies are, angels
or ministering spirits, they certainly do not belong to
the present visible universe. The writers examine the
sacred records to confirm their speculations.
Thus, then, we have a visible and an invisible universe,
and we have processes of delicacy in the former which at
least suggest the action on it of agencies belonging to
the latter. Let us look at the first phenomenon of the
visible universe—the expenditure of energy in it. The
sun's energy is issuing in what is apparently waste space
just as it is issuing in that portion of space which is filled
by our earth. What becomes of the energy—probably
far more than half of that which proceeds from it—which
proceeds apparently nowhere, speeding on with the velo-
city of light? Is it absorbed in the ether, and if so, what
does the ether do with it? The writers suggest that the
ether may preserve for intelligent beings the record of
the past. But that seems scarcely sufficient use of the

energies spent on it; the more so as the intelligent beings
existing in the visible universe will certainly come to an
end with it.
"We were led," say the authors, in a passage in
which their whole theory is perhaps summed up, "to
conclude that the visible system is not the whole uni-
verse, but only, it may be, a very small part of it;
and that there must be an invisible order of things,
which will remain and possess energy when the pre-
sent system has passed away. Furthermore, we have
seen that an argument derived from the beginning rather
than the end of things assures us that the invisible uni-
verse existed before the visible one. From this we con-
clude that the invisible universe exists now, and this
conclusion will be strengthened when we come to discuss
the nature of the invisible universe, and to see that it
cannot possibly have been changed into the present, but
must exist independently now. It is, moreover, very
closely connected with the present system, inasmuch as
this may be looked upon as having come into being through
its means.
"Thus we are led to believe that there exists now an
invisible order of things intimately connected with the
present, and capable of acting energetically upon it—for,
in truth, the energy of the present system is to be looked
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
upon as originally derived from the invisible universe.
"Now, is it not natural to imagine that a universe of
this nature, which we have reason to think exists, and is
connected by bonds of energy with the visible universe, is
also capable of receiving energy from it? Whether is it
more likely that by far the larger portion of the high-class
energy of the present universe is travelling outwards into
space with an immense velocity, or that it is gradually
transferred into an invisible order of things? May we
not regard ether or the medium as not merely a bridge
between one portion of the visible universe and another,
but also as a bridge between one order of things and
another, forming as it were a species of cement, in virtue
of which the various orders of the universe are welded
together and made into one? In fine, what we generally
call ether may be not a mere medium, but a medium plus
the invisible order of things, so that when the motions of
the visible universe are transferred into ether, part of
them are conveyed as by a bridge into the invisible uni-
verse, and are there made use of or stored up. Nay, is it
even necessary to retain the conception of a bridge?

by studious labour the phenomena he had recorded might
be reduced to something like rule and order, he under-
took the elaborate theoretical discussion of them, and
the Society, appreciating the value of the work, has not
only awarded him the prize for it, but has published it,
in full detail, for the benefit of science in general
The author was led to this investigation by the double
object of obtaining accurate information, first, as to the
general phenomena of the tides in the Adriatic, or rather
in the Mediterranean generally; and secondly, as to the
peculiarities in these phenomena induced by local influ-

ences in the neighbourhood of the port of Fiume.
He remarks, in regard to the first point, that the semi-
mensual irregularity which it is customary to deduce from
observations, in order to predict the times of high and low
water, is altogether different in the Adriatic from what
obtains in regard to the ocean generally; and yet the
causes of this difference have never yet been explained.
In regard to the second point, he refers to notices that
had appeared of remarkable irregularities in the Fiume
tides, which rendered further investigation very desirable.
It had been perceived, that instead of the usual six hours'
alternating ebb and flow, there was frequently only one
high and one low water in the day; and, moreover, that
the time of the lowest water advanced on the average two
hours every month, or twenty-four hours in a year.
These strange phenomena had attracted attention, and
in 1868 the Adria Commission of the Imperial Academy
of Sciences at Vienna established a self-registering tide-
gauge at Fiume, the control of which was entrusted to
M. Stahlberger. The present essay contains the results
of three years' observations, which are fully and scientifi-

although it had been erroneously ascribed by him to the
effect of the wind. The real cause he shows to be the
oscillations depending on sidereal time.
The non-periodical motions of the water are caused
chiefly by variations in the direction and force of the wind,
and in the barometer-pressure. The temperature of the sea
rain, and storms, may have also some influence, but too
slight to require investigation.
The author therefore confines his attention to the wind
and the pressure of the air. In regard to the former,
looking at the form and position of the Gulf of Quarnero,
it is evident that southerly winds will force the water into
the cul-de-sac towards Fiume, and so will raise the
le*-el, whi'e northerly winds will ttr.d to drive the water
out of the gulf, and so lower the surface.
In regard to the barometer-pressure, it is pointed out

away, there must be a corresponding difference in the
level of the water ; [and this [difference will be propor-

(London : Sampson Low and Co., 1875.)
COL. WARBURTON well deserves any honours which he
may have received ; for the sake of increasing knowledge
he has performed as bold a feat of travel as is on record.
With his son, Mr. J. W. Lewis, two Afghan camel-drivers,
and two natives, he set out on April 15, 1873, from Alice
Springs, in E. long. 133° 53' 14", S. lat. 23° 40', about
1,120 miles north from Adelaide, and travelled right across
the centre of the Australian continent, reaching the
western side in January 1874. Col. Warburton's narrative
in the book befcre us consists of the record which he kept
day by day of his progress. The party had sixteen camels,
and were provisioned for fix months. Experience has
shown that to explore Central Australia camels alone are
of any use, horses being totally unable to bear up against
the universal scarcity of water, and the bristling spinitex

stalks which cover the ground alrr.ost everywhere, and
which cut their legs to pieces. Col. Warburton's journal,
not long after the start, becomes a painful record of a
daily hunt after water, a hunt which was often unsuccess-
ful. During the greater part of the journey man and
beast were in a chronic state of parching thirst. The
country crossed over is as arid and desolate a wilderness
as can well be conceived, consisting mainly of low sandy
hills covered almost everywhere with the above-mentioned
spinifex, occasionally varied by a salt marsh, a few hills,
and rarely a few trees. Indeed, the whole country from
121° to 131° E. long, is one great sandy desert. Bustards,
one or two species of pigeons, owls, rats, a small species
of kangaroo, swarms of torturing flies and ants, were
met with, the last-mentiomd with painful frequency.
Natives were also seen, and they proved perfectly harm-
less and generally shy, and some cf them Col. Warburton
describes as haiu'some and well made.
The general method of procuring water was to scoop
out wells in the sand, and it was only at long intervals

The Degeneracy of Man
THE numbers of NATURE for Jnne and July last, which have
lately reached me (vol. x. pp. 146, 164, 204 and 205), contain a
correspondence on the subject of the degeneracy of man, in con-
nection with which 1 wish to contribute a few remarks.
I have nothing to say on the original point introduced by Mr.
E. B. Tylor. But, during my residence in the islands of the
Pacific, 1 have given some attention to the general question of
degradation or progression, as exhibited in the Polynesians.

The result is, that I believe there are numerous indications of
the degeneracy of these people from a higher social and intel-
lectual level than that which they at present cccuj.y. I could
not give in detail, in this letter, the entire evidence on which
this opinion is based; I will therefore briefly mention two or
three indications only of this degeneracy which I have noticed.
The language of the Polynesians furnishes one of these.
While there is much in it which shows a low moral tone, there
are, on the other hand, many refinements (a large proportion of
which are known to most of the present generation) which I do
not believe could have been. invented, or gradually developed,
by the rj.ce in its present intellectual condition. Their old tra-
ditional stories, and their ancient poetry also, are so different
from anything the present Polynesians are capable of producing,
that I often think (your classical readers will please pardon the
comparison) the relative difference, between the past and present,
is as great as that between the intellect of the Greeks, in the
period of the highest Attic culture, and those of the present
century. I have often asked men of more than avenge intelli-
gence, why their modern compositions are so inferior to many of
the old ones. They invariably reply that the men of old were

remaining constant) is a logarithmic function was plainly indi-
cated in the last paragraph but one in my second paper in
NATURE, p. 277. In my paper in the Amtrican Journal oj
Science, Feb. 1875, p. 130, a formula was given at the close oi
the paper, p. 137, which is equivalent to Hinrich's formula (i),
calling T the time of exhaustion (or number of lifts), and j the
strength of the muscle obtained with a dynamometer, and

real strength in kilograms, ft would equal w. In the series pub-
lished in N ATURE, s was obtained in another way, there described,
and /3 was zero (nearly); v is a function of the weight. So that
Hinrichs' formula does not seem to differ essentially from (2).
In giving this formula, I stated expressly that I did not wish to
discuss this equation at present, as the constants had not been
determined with satisfactory precision. I take this occasion to
repeat that statement.
Another point to which it may be well to call attention is,
that in exhausting the arm with heavy weights very little pain is
felt. With light weights, however, the pain is very great

Physiological Effects of Tobacco Smoke
Is Dr. Krause (NATURE, vol. xi. p. 456, vol. xii. p. ^14)
acquainted with the manner in which cascarilla bark modifies
the physiological effects of tobacco smoking? The addi-
tion of a few very small fragments of the bark can hardly
be supposed to materially affect the amount of carbonic
oxide produced ; and yet, with such an admixture, the strongest
tobacco may be smoked by a tyro without, in most cases, the
production of the usual nauseating effects. Loss cf appetite,
thirst, vascular and nervous depression are sometimes produced
if such a mixture is smoked in excess. On the other hand, if Dr.
Kraose's theory, that the nausea, &c., of tobacco smoking is due
to the carbonic oxide inhaled, be admitted, the question is sug-
gested whether some of the volatile products of burnt cascarilla
bark are antagonistic in their physiological action to the gas in
question? C. E. S.

quently send home specimens of Conifers, Cycad cones,
or others of a similar nature simply rolled in paper or
packed in sawdust; in the one case they dry and fall to
pieces immediately upon opening, while in the other the
sawdust absorbs moisture, and the fruit or cone simply
rots and becomes quite worthless. Another advantage
in sending woody fruits like the Pandani in fluid in the
manner above described, is that they can be removed,
dried, and mounted on wooden stands, by which they are
more convenient for examination, and occupy much less
space, and are manifestly more economical both for public
and private collections than when preserved in large glass
jars in alcohol. The collection, numbering some twenty-
three heads of fruits, sufficiently illustrates the variety of
form and size in the different species, the largest being
some thirteen inches through, and the smallest not more
than two inches. Mr. Balfour, who accompanied the

special attention to the Pandanea, and his collections,
preserved, we believe in a similar manner, have recently

of Croton. The bulk is- obtained from Madagascar,

however, to be the produce of Zanzibar, probably on
account of that from Madagascar passing by way of
Zanzibar in course of transit to India, to whence it is
mostly shipped, chiefly, it is said, for the purpose of burn-

price than the true sandal-wood. The wood of the

elaborate carvings of the human face have been found in
Western New York, figures of which are given in the
Thirteenth Annual Report of Regents of New York

origin with the western mound specimens. The specimen
here figured is, I believe, the only one ever found in New

common to the bed of the Delaware River, above tide
water. It measures six inches in length by a fraction
over four inches in greatest breadth. It is concavo-
convex, the concavity being shallow and artificial. The
carving of the front or convex side is very rude, but shows
distinctly that it has been done with stone tools only. The
eyes are simply conical counter-sunk holes, rudely ridged,
and just such depressions as the stone drills, so common
among the surface relics of this neighbourhood, would
produce. In the collection of stone implements from
Central New Jersey, at the Peabody Academy of Salem,

and deep depressions as the " eyes " of this mask. The

groove. The ears are broken, but appear to have been
formed with more care than any other of the features.
The chin is slightly projecting.
The interest attaching to this specimen is, I think,
twofold, and worthy of a moment's consideration. It
is interesting from the fact of being found in New
Jersey, a point much further east than the mound-
builders have been supposed to reach, and there is
no reason to suppose that the specimen was ever brought
by white men from the west, and lost here. The cir-
cumstances connected with its discovery render such
a supposition untenable. Its interest, otherwise, is in
the fact (as I suppose it) of its being a true relic of the
mound-builders. The mystery of this people has cer-
tainly yet to be solved, if, indeed, it ever can be, and the
relationship they bore to the " Indian" determined. In
the prosecution of my investigations into the " stone-age"
history of the New Jersey Indians, I was continually
struck with the great resemblance of the stone-imple-
ments found in New Jersey to those found in the
western mounds. The specimens figured by Messrs.
Squier and Davis, in the first vol. of Smithsonian Contri-
butions, 1847, were all, or nearly so, duplicated by speci-
mens I gathered in New Jersey ; and up to the time of the
completion of my second paper on the Stone Age of New

Jersey (now in press), I needed but "animal pipes" and
stone masks, such as the above, to make the duplication
of the mound-relics complete. The occurrence of this
specimen brings it to the one form of pipes, and that such
have occurred in New Jersey is highly probable; but
not having gathered such a specimen, myself, I assume
that none have yet been found. It must be borne in
mind, however, that as there are no mounds in New
Jersey, animal pipes, if found here, must occur as surface
relics, or in graves; which latter were, as a rule, very
shallow. As New Jersey has been settled for about two
centuries, it is probable that such animal pipes would be
gathered up, when found, and soon again lost or de-
stroyed, when ordinary "relics" would be overlooked.
In this way, such animal pipes would have all dis-
appeared, perhaps a century ago, when their value as
archasological specimens was unknown. This, too, might
account for the great rarity of such specimens as the
mask here described. Chas. C. Abbott

flower and bring their pollen-covered under-side first in

anthers. The flowers of Lilium Martagon must conse-
quently be considered as adapted to cross-fertilisation by
Lepidoptera.
The colour of these flowers, dark reddish brown, with
dark purple dots on the inside, is not very striking, and
in the daytime they are but slightly scented, whereas
during the evening they emit a very attractive sweet
odour. Hence we may safely conclude that they are far
more attractive to crepuscular and nocturnal than to
diurnal Lepidoptera.
Thus far, in Thuringia, in July 1873, I had succeeded in
explaining the separate peculiarities of the flowers; but
in vain had I watched them repeatedly during the evening
in order to surprise the fertilisers in the very act of
fertilisation. But the hope I had failed in when making
every effort to realise it, happened to be fulfilled a year
later, quite unexpectedly. In the Vosges, returning from

flowering plants of Lilium Martagon growing in a
garden hard by, and a specimen of Macroglossa stella-
tarum flying round them and fertilising them.
Fie. 64.—A single sepal or petal of this flower, magnified.
Freely fixed in the air by the rapid movement of his
wings, this busy Sphinx inserted his long slender pro-
boscis into the honey-channels of the sepals and petals,
now of a single one, now of others of the same flower, and
having done so immediately flew away to another flower.
Yet, the flowers never being turned directly downwards,
but somewhat inclined, all the honey-channels of any
flower were never sucked by the Sphinx, but in every case
only those of the uppermost sepals and petals. When
sucking he always touched the stigmas and the anthers
with his legs and under-side, and the latter ones were to
be seen rocking and swinging. Thus, undoubtedly, the
under-side of the Sphinx was dusted with pollen, and the
stigma of the flower next visited, when first touched by
the pollen-covered under-side, was cross-fertilised. A single
Sphinx, with his vehement movements during a quarter
of an hour, may easily visit and cross-fertilise plenty of
flowers of Lilium Martagon. Nevertheless, self-fertili-
sation in many of these flowers will occur, where visits of

NOTE ON THE HYRCANIAN SEA
THE resolution of the problems which are involved in
the physical aspects of Western Turkestan, and
¦which have offered so ample a scope for speculation, will
probably be one of the earliest and most important con-
sequences of the occupation of the banks of the Amii
Darya by Russia. But, whatever may be the light which
will thus be afforded to geographers, ethnologists, or his-
torians, it is to be expected that the field of inquiry will
•widen and recede, in proportion as each step forward is
made, along paths which have hitherto been shrouded in
obscurity.
Among the observations which will demand, and which
will most certainly fully repay, the greatest attention, are

rnunication could, and almost certainly did, take place in
the following way.
The crest of the spur of the Ust Urt plateau, which
formed the southerly limit of the now desiccated gull
Abougir, is about fifty feet above the present level o!
Lake Aral. Once filled up to that level, if the lake con-
tinued to receive more water than was evaporated from
its surface, i.e. more than 3,400 cubic yards per second,
an overflow would take place into the country now tra-
versed by the channel called Uzboy, which has a gentle
slope to the south of less than four inches per mile.* It
is probable that the lands stretching from Uzboy west-
wards to the foot of the elevations encircling Karaboogas
would have been flooded. Perhaps at this high level
Aral may have discharged at its extreme north-western
point also, and have flooded the country stretching round
the northern foot of Ust Urt. On the north, it may have
topped the low transverse ridge which now divides the
northern and southern drainage. And if, in addition, the
level of the Caspian was at that time some few feet higher
than it now is, its waterspread would have advanced to
meet the overflow from Aral, and Ust Urt and its narrow

southern spurs, which run along the cast shore of the
Caspian, would have been isolated among marshes and
shallow water. The classical geographers would thus
have had ample grounds for the description they have
handed down to us of the Sea of Hyrcania, as well as
good reason for giving but a single name to the water-
spread of the sea, since the separation of its basin from
that of Aral would have become evident only after the
fall of the level of this lake.
Until the separation became evident, this Aralo-Caspian
Sea would have presented all those aspects which history
tells us it hns had. As the level gradually fell in Lake
Aral, the inundated ground would become dryer; and
in the first century of our era, as reported by the
Chinese, the banks of the "Western Sea" would have
been surrounded with great marshes. It may be doubted
whether the Palus Oxiana of Ptolemy and the Oxian
Marsh mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus should be
placed in this locality; but there is more probability that
the Sinus Scythicus of Mela is identical with Lake Aral
and its former southern marshy appendage, of which
Uzboy is the axis.
The waterspread of such an Aralo-Caspian Sea would
have added an area of about 70,000 square miles to the
limits of the Caspian of to-day; and the evaporation

from such a surface would have absorbed a supply from
the rivers then feeding Lake Aral of about 7,000 cubic
yards per second; in other words, a volume of water
three-and-a-half times greater than that discharged by
the mouths of the Amii and the Syr together at the
present time.
If it be considered that at this epoch the greater, if not
indeed the entire volume of the Oxus passed directly
westwards into the Caspian, the difficulty is somewhat
increased in finding an answer to the important question,
where the large volume of water mentioned came from?
However, it is very probable that the Tchuy and the
Sary Su discharged at that time into Lake Aral, instead
of losing themselves, as they now do, in the sand. The
Kenderlik of the great Russian chart, as well as the
Dcmous, the Baskatis, and the Araxetes of the classics,
together no doubt with many other minor streams, have
disappeared in these countries, though their waters for-
merly would have fed Aral. Their disappearance seems
to have been contemporaneous with the desiccation of the
Oxus branch of the Caspian, at an epoch when those

duced by the warming action of the sun on the solid
surface exposed to its rays. These special currents,
although somewhat dangerous in making a descent, die
out at an altitude of a few hundred feet. The superficial
current experienced in the Algiers ascent was running
eastwards, and was really a marine current produced by
the vicinity of the sea. A peculiarity of this ascent was the
presence of a fog, observed at a certain distance above
the earth, in air which was coming from the water and had
been rendered humid when crossing the Mediterranean
Sea. The thermometer, which was only 23° centigrade on
the ground, ascended gradually to 25°, and gave 38° and
40° when the balloon had traversed the fog. The maxi-
mum observed was 43" at a small altitude.
Clouds do not always prevent the rays of the sun from
warming the atmosphere below to a certain extent In
an ascent executed at Avignon (Vaucluse) on the 6th, the
thermometer exhibited a warming effect of 5° C., although
the balloon had not passed through the clouds, which were
at an elevation of more than 4,000 feet.

As much of our knowledge of the sea has been ob-

good management on the part of aeronautical societies,

the experiments lately made with sulpho-carbonate of potash
were, however, perfectly successful, as they do not effect the
vine in the least; they were made by M. Milne-Edwards, Du
Chartre, Blanchard, Pasteur, Thenard, and lioulay, in different
wine-growing districts, particularly in the environs of Avignon,
Cognac, Montpellier, and Geneva. The sulpho-carbonates are
strewed on the ground, the next rain helps them to penetrate
the soil, and the Phylloxera are completely destroyed by them.
These salts at present are still rather expensive, but in the dis-
tricts where the Phylloxera have only just appeared a very small
quantity is sufficient, and it is hoped that if Government under-
takes a larger production of the salts, the price will be consider-
ably reduced.

cautious in future in showing visitors the spectacle of Ophidians
running after their food.

Louis Agassiz.
PROF. SIIALER has published a memoir upon the "Antiquity
of the Caverns and Cavern Life of the Ohio Valley," in which
he endeavours to show the period at which the animal life, so
characteristic of Western caverns, received its first expression.
He sums up his researches in the following propositions :—I.
The extensive development of caverns in the Ohio Valley is
probably a comparatively recent phenomenon, not dating further
back than the latest Tertiary period. 2. It is doubtful whether
there has been any extensive development of cavern life in this
region before these caverns of the subcarboniferous limestone
began to be excavated. 3. The general character of this cavern
life points to the conclusion that it has been derived from the
present fauna. 4. The glacial period, though it did not extend
(he ice-sheet over this cavern region, must have so profoundly
affected the climatal conditions that the external life could not
have held its place here in the shape we now find it, but must
have been replaced by some Arctic assemblage of species.
Under the circumstances, it is reasonable to suppose that most,
if not all, the species found in these caves have been introduced
since the glacial period. 5. We are also warranted by the facts

in supposing that there is a continued infusion of "new blood"
from the outer species taking place, some of the forms showing
the stages of a continual transition from the outer to the inner
form.

that if these prevail the number of other species is relatively
Jess. While, on the other hand, only one species of Laminaria
•.vith an entire, and one with a laciniated frond, is found on the
Swedish coast, there are on the coasts of Spitzbergen and
Greenland at least five species of Laminaria. The L. tunfifolia
of Greenland is about the same size as L, saccharina ; but L.
longicruris, one of the commonest Alga; of Greenland, is very
large; the stalk, which is sometimes many ells * long, bears a
lamina (frond) of equal size. Some specimens had been seen by
Prof. Agardh, which, including both stem and frond, were
eighty feet long. Ruprecht mentions an Alaria from the Sea of
Okhotsk, the frond of which was about the same breadth as that
nf the common European form, which had a length of more than
fifty feet. From Spitzbergen comes another species of this
genus, whose frond is as much as one ell in length and about
three ells long ; and also another species several ells long, with a
stem as thick as a finger. But it is especially in the north part
of the Pacific, on the North American coast, that the richness of
the Laminarian forms and their great size are most conspicuous.
The species of Alaria, Arthrothamnus, Thalassiophyllum, Aga-
rum, and Nereocystis together constitute such a magnificent
marine flora, that one feels a difficulty in forming an idea of the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:46 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
smaller representatives of the same group which are found in
other seas. Nereocystis Lutkeana has a stalk 270 feet in length,
when it swells into a bladder that bears a tuft of fronds which are
quite twenty-seven feet in length. In the Antarctic seas the
analogues are to be found, the Durvillxa, and Lessonia of Cape
Horn, Ecklonia of the South African coast, the species of Macro-
cystis, &c., are well-known examples of the large Algae which are
found there.
It is perhaps less surprising that a rich marine flora should
appear on the coast ol Spitzbergen wherever a considerable
branch of the water of the Gulf Stream follows the coast, and
in proportion receives a higher temperature and a greater degree
of saltness. But in Greenland it may be otherwise. Cold cur-
rents are said to flow along the west coast of Greenland up-
wards, as well as on the opposite coast of America downwards, t
During a considerable portion of the year the sea appears to he
frozen along the coast, and even during the summer months drift
ice is reported to be continually seen in the open sea. Under
such conditions, although a marine vegetation of large size ap-
pears there, it may be assumed that an ice-cold or nearly ice-
cold sea by no means prevents a great development of Algae,
where the other conditions necessary for their growth are found.
One is tempted to believe that the great abundance and size of
the marine flora on the coasts of the colder seas, on the one
hand, and on the other the richness of the open seas in Diato-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
mace;e, are in some measure the cause of the abundance ot
animal life which prevails in these regions, and which, in the
regularity of its limits, may afford a hint to the expeditions for
carrying on the whale fishery that every year employs thousands
of vessels. "It has been remarked," says Ruprecht, "that the
northern boundary of the large sea animals is found where the
coast is most bare of Alga;;" and Maury (" Physical Geography
of the Sea") remarks on the superior flavour of fish from the
colder waters, and the greater excellence of the principal fishery
grounds of the world, which are all situated in the colder waters.
In direct opposition to what occurs on the Greenland and
Spitzbergen coast, Ruprecht states that the whole coast of
Behring's Sea north of the Aleutian Islands is almost entirely
without marine vegetation ; an astonishing statement, as not only
on the Aleutian Isles, but also on the American coast to the
south of them, the marine flora is rich and is developed on a
grand scale. Ruprecht's statement that the whole Arctic sea of
Siberia, eastward from the Gulf of Kara to Behiing's Sound, is
almost entiiely without marine vegetation, is almost open to
doubt, since Prof. Agardh possesses specimens of two Algre in
good preservation which were taken near the mouth of the Lena,

during different periods of their development, and this more fre-
quently in an analogous manner. DuriDg the first period they
are so like each other that it is almost impossible to separate one
from the other the younger forms of the most dissimilar species.
They all begin with a short stalk and an undivided frond (lamina);
then the stalk continues short in some, and lengthens consider-
ably in others; in some the lamina continues undivided; in
others it is cloven. But it is especially to be observed that
this lamina, whether undivided or cloven, is variable in most
species. Thus, all are at first small and extended in length,
with a more or less wedge like base ; but the wedge-like base
becomes heart-shaped and even kidney-shaped in some ; in others
it retains a wedge-like form throughout its whole state of deve-
lopment. Most species periodically change their lamina; with
the change the new lamina becomes larger and broader than the
old one. The young lamina is thin ; in colour rather inclining
to green than to light brown ; in different species the lamina is
at a later period thinner or thicker, and with a different tint of
colour. The fructification appears in different species not only
in different parts of the lamina, but the sori extend in different
directions, although they do not seem to assume precise forms.

The characteristics of species must therefore be judged, not
Irom the peculiarities of appearance, but by the w hole develop-
ment of the plant, the differences of which are with difficulty
comprehended, unless the species throughout their whole range
of growth be accurately compared with each other. Considering
that certain characteristics are scarcely perceptible except when
the plants are in fresh condition, and that collectors are contented
with preserving portions or incomplete specimens only, we
cannot wonder that the species of Laminaria should be confounded
with each other.
Greville had named a Laminaria from the coast of Africa,
Z. pallida, from a modification in its colour. Younger forms, in
which the colour was less evident, or the lamina not yet cloven,
were referred by many algologists sometimes to Z. digilata, some-
times to Z. saccharina. But between these northern species and
that of the Cape, lies an ocean which it is difficult for a Laminaria
to pass. Although the characters which separate Z. pallida and
Z digilata are not more important than those which separate
Z. digilata from Z. slenophylla, it must, nevertheless, be consi-
dered that L. pallida is a distinct species.
Z. longicruris is the most common as well as the largest of
the Greenland Laminariae. It is the representative on their
coast of Z. caperata, a native of Spitzbergen, no specimens of
which have been seen from Greenland, neither has Z. longicruris
yet been found at Spitzbergen. From Greenland Z. longi-

cruris spreads down the American coast as far at least as the
forty-second parallel, and one specimen is reported from the
Bahamas. Portions of this species have been cast ashore on
the coasts of Norway, Ireland, and Scotland. In Gunner's
"Flora Norvegica," a form i-i mentioned under the name of Ulva
maxima, which Agardh considers to be Z. caperata; the same
ioim has also been found on the north coast ol Scotland.
The Berggren collection also contained a great number of
examples of Laminaria that, by Dickie (Algx from Cumberland
Sound, in Linn. Soc. Journ. vol. ix. p. 237) and by Croall (in
Brown's "Flora Discoana," Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinb. p. 459),
was called Z. saccharina. Prof. Agardh considers the above-
mentioned plant as identical with his L. cuneijolia. He states
that he has never seen a specimen from Greenland of L saccha-
rina as it appears on our coast. Z. citnei/olia is an example of
a species which is found near Greenland and also in the northern
part ot the Pacific. The Alga described by Ruprecht under
the name of Z. saccharina v. lissonia'Joliaravj be a smaller form
of the same species. Specimens from Newfoundland and Scot-
land have been seen, which may belong to the same species. *

other genera, appear to be formed upon a single type, contri-
butes naturally to the common opinion that the genus has few
but much-varying species. In describing the Greenland forms,
Prof. Agardh has endeavoured to show that besides the differ-
ence in form, deviations also occur which ought to be retained
as characteristics. In a preceding memoir he had stated that
the differences noticed by other algologists in the antheridia and
spores being formed in the same or in separate receptacles may
possibly be explained thus: namely, that in different seasons the
receptacles dilier in this respect. Should such an explanation
prove to be erroneous, it will undoubtedly be seen that it is these
differences, more than others, that deserve to be considered as
the characteristics of species.

are sensitive to all the visible rays of the spectrum. Agl is more
sensitive than AgBr to all the less relrangible rays and also to
white light. The sensitiveness of AgBr to the green rays was
materially increased by the presence of free silver nitrate. AgBr
and Agl together are more sensitive to both the green and the
red rays than either Agl or AgBr separately.—On the Silurian

But the fact incidentally observed of the varying character of the

near coincidence of two of them with prominent coronal lines,

distance to be traversed by the light was very small, and because
the path of the ray lay through a vortex of air produced by the

Royal Horticultural Society, April 7.—Scientific Com-
mittee. A. Grote, F. L. S., in the chair.—A communication
was read from \V. Wilson Saunders, F.R. S., describing a
diseased condition of young poplars planted on the sides of roads
in Fast Worthing. The disease seems sooner or later to be fatal
to the tree, for he had not seen one tree attacked of which there
seems any chance of recovery. The trees are from twelve to
eighteen feet high, and with stems varying from five to seven
inches in diameter. The disease is most apparent in large,
rough, open wounds about the commencement of the lower
branches, and on the stem; but upon closer examination
symptoms of the disease will be found all over the tree, even to
the tops of the branches. The disease seems to show itself at
first by a longitudinal fissure in the bark, which fissure is nearly
straight and but of little depth, having its lips slightly elevated
and reflexed. At first the fissure does not penetrate the whole
depth of the bark, but, gradually deepening and extending in
length, the wood becomes exposed. This continues until the
wood is quite exposed, and in a branch of two years' growth the
disease assumes the appearance of a long open wound, exposing
much of the wood which the growth of the bark partially covers
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
up. Tracing the progress of the disease further, side fissures
will be seen producing the same results; and these fissures,
running one into the other, break up the bark until occasionally
the disease extends all round the branch. When a branch gets
diseased, the portion above the wound dies. The disease is
often slow in progress, particularly when on the main stem,
large open wounds then appear, of the same character as those
on the branches, exposing much of the wood, but having the
surrounding bark, although diseased and cracked, in a healthier
state.—Mr. M'Lachlan referred to a note in the report of Lieut.
Carpenter, of the American Geological Survey, in which it was
slated that the Colorado Potato Beetle was distributed by means
of seed potatoes, and that its absence in Utah and other parts of
California was to be attributed to the fact that it has not yet
been necessary to import seed potatoes.—Mr. Hemsley sent a

remarkable for being either apterous or with greatly abbreviated
wings. Mr. M 'Lachlan said that the theory as to the apterous con-
dition of the insects was that the general high winds prevailing in
those regions rendered the development of wings useless ; and Sir.
Jenner Weir remarked that the apterous condition was correlated
with the fact that plants under similar circumstances were apetalous
and self-fertilising; and hence it was supposed that the existence of
winged insects was unnecessary. —Mr. C. O. Waterhouse exhi-

Cambridge
Philosophical Society, May 3.—A communication was

mentioned various methods in use for checking the swing of the

troller for rough work was a desideratum. He described an
instrument in the form of a continuously varying shunt, in which
a moving connection was obtained by a tube filled with mercury
sliding on a wire of suitable resistance. This form of connec-
tion was first used by Prof. Barrett of Dublin. With the aid of

that a very good connection was obtained by this means ; and

THE ARCTIC EXPEDITION
A CCORDING to present arrangements, the Arctic

We feel that this event is one of no ordinary scientific
importance, and indeed that it is significant, in a high
degree, of a change which has come over the ideas of the
governors and the governed alike in this country.
While prior Expeditions have advanced knowledge on
their way to a high northern latitude, the present one
sails to a high northern latitude for the purpose of
advancing knowledge. We believe that the Admiralty
authorities are fully aware of the importance of this dis-
tinction, and that when the final Instructions about to be
issued to Capt. Nares are published, it will be seen that
although they have been compelled to lay down a route
and to state a goal to be reached if possible, the advance-
ment of natural knowledge as opposed to mere topography
is recognised as the main object.
All the best hearts in Britain will beat higher at the
thought of this noble British attempt to drive still

attempt is surrounded. The work is undoubtedly one of
difficulty, and although a combination of past experience
and present discipline may be regarded as certain to
restore to us at some future day the gallant men now
aboard the Alert and Discovery, it is almost too much to
hope that both the ships will run the gauntlet of the ice-
barriers both out and home. Capt. Nares, we presume,
has, as the Admiralty Arctic Committee recommended, full
authority to abandon the Alert in 1877 if the exploration
in 1876 has been final or her escape be doubtful, and the
possible abandonment of both ships is contemplated in
the Committee's Report: this shows that the Admiralty
has counted the cost, and the fact that the Expedition
sails shows us how the benefit resulting from scientific
inquiry is acknowledged by the Government.
Were the officers of the ships less devoted to the scien-
tific side of their work, or less capable of undertaking it
than they are, they might be fairly alarmed at the parting
gifts of the men of science which they have received
this week in the shape of Instruments of all kinds, a

eight hundred pages, and Scientific Instructions in the

SACHS'S "TEXT-BO OX" OF BOTANY"
Text-book of Botany, Morphological and Physiological.
By Julius Sachs, Professor of Botany in the University
of Wurzburg. Translated and annotated by Alfred
VV. Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S., assisted by W. T.
Thiselton Dyer, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.S. (Oxford : at the
Clarendon Press, 1875.)
IN 1868 the first edition of Dr. Sachs's " Lehrbuch der
Botanik" appeared in Germany; a second edition
was soon called for, and it appeared in 1870; the third
was published in 1873, and the fourth was issued about
the end of 1874. The third edition was translated into
French and annotated by M. Ph. van Tieghem, and now
we have an English translation of the same edition from
the hands of Messrs. Bennett and Dyer.
The want of a good text-book of Botany, one that would
give an accurate idea of the present state of botanical
science, has long been felt by English students. We
therefore heartily welcome the appearance of the English
translation of Sachs's "Lehrbuch der Botanik," because
wc feel certain that it will supply that want so long felt,

and be of the greatest value to both teachers and students.
Our text-books had mostly fallen behind the time, the
older ideas and theories were still retained instead of
being swept away to make room for new facts or for the
more correct interpretation of long-known but imperfectly
understood phenomena. The illustrations of the older
works were often defective, frequently absolutely incoirect,
and yet they.descended from text-book to text-book with
unfailing regularity. Terms were multiplied needlessly,
without any cotrect appreciation of the facts to be indicated
by them; lectures became a mere illustrated botanical
glossary, the biology and physiology of plants were almost
entirely neglected, and the science rendered as repulsive
as possible. In the work now before us we have a text-
book of Botany which the teacher can confidently recom-
mend to the student as being an excellent guide; as
giving an extensive and trustworthy account of the pre-
sent state of botanical science in Europe; and while it
indicates the theories and problems at present occupying
the attention of botanists, it points him to the subjects
which will best repay the original investigator. The
illustrations form an important feature in the work, most
of them being original, and the result of laborious investi-
gation: if borrowed, it was only when the objects were
inacessible, or because it seemed impossible to give a

better than the figure already in use. This gives a fresh-
ness to the book, which is a chaim in a text-book of
Botany.
Prof. Sachs's work is devoted exclusively to Morpho-
logical and Physiological Botany, and therefore differs
in its scope from the text-books to which botanical
students in this country are accustomed. The whole
work is divided into three books. Books I. and II. treat
respectively of General and Special Morphology, Book III.
being devoted to Physiology. No exhaustive account of
the characters of the natural orders of flowering plants is
given, a feature which at once places Sachs's text-book in
marked contrast to our English ones. All that is given
is an enumeration of the orders and families according to
the systems recently proposed by Braun and Han stein.
But the want of characters of orders and families cannot
be felt by the English student, as he can consult the
admirable translation of Le Maout and Decaisne's
"Tfaite" General de Botanique," and there get all he can
possibly want. Indeed, we may look upon Sachs and Le
Maout and Decaisne as forming a complete work, the

carpels, many tendrils and prickles, &c, are altogether
similar (in mode of development) to the green organs
which have been termed simply leaves." So with all the
Other members; they may be modified to perform the
most varied functions.
The second book, treating of Special Morphology and
outlines of Classification, will probably be found to be
the most generally interesting part of the work. It
gives a clear and valuable account of all the " classes" of
the vegetable kingdom, which, according to our author,
are thirteen in number, and are to be further arranged in
five groups, viz., Thallophytes, Characeae, Muscineae,
Vascular Cryptogams, and Phanerogams. Here the
industry and care of the author are well shown, as he has
collected from all trustworthy sources, descriptions of the
structure and life-history of typical forms of plants. This
classification is slightly modified in the appendix, which
is taken from the fourth edition. The distinction
between the Algae and Fungi, namely, that the Algae
contain chlorophyll, while the Fungi do not, is disregarded,
and the Algae, Fungi, and Characeos made into four

classes, the characters being taken from the modes of
sexual reproduction. It seems a pity that the division of
the Vascular Cryptogams into classes was not recon-
sidered, as the discovery of the prothallium of Lycopodium
breaks down the division into isoporous and hetero-
sporous groups. We prefer a division of the vascular
cryptogams into three classes: Filicina?, Equisetaceae,
and Lycopodinae. The Filicinae include four orders—
Filices, Maraltiaceae, Ophioglossaceae, and Rhizocarpeae—
while the Lycopodinae include three, viz., Lycopodiae,
Selaginellae, and Isoeteae. The chapter on the groups of
flowerless plants are of great interest, and will be studied
with pleasure by those who have only seen the meagre
*.nd often untrustworthy account given in some of our
text-books.
Passing to the Phanerogams, Sachs considers the dis-
tinguishing characteristic of the group to be the formation
of the seed. He contrasts the Cryptogams and Phane-
rogams, and points out the homologies of the reproduc-
tive organs. "This organ (the seed) is developed from
the ovule, which, in its essential part, the nucleus, pro-
duces the embryo-sac, and in this the endosperm and
the embryonic vesicle. The latter is fertilised by the
pollen-tube, an outgrowth of the pollen-grain, and,
after first growing into a pro-embryo, produces the

embryo. The phanerogamic plant, which is differ-
entiated into stem-leaves, roots, and hairs, corre-
sponds to the spore-forming (asexual) generation of vas-
cular cryptogams ; the embryo-sac to the Macrospore : the
pollen-grain to the Microspore: the endosperm is equi-
valent to the female prothallium ; and the seed unites in
itself, at least for a time, the two generations, the Pro-
thallium (endosperm) together with the young plants of
the second (sexual) generation (the embryo)." Throughout
the whole ol the chapters of the second book, the influence
of the "Theory of Descent" is very evident. Sachs, how-
ever, withdraws, in the fourth edition, the pedigree of the
vegetable kingdom, which he sketches in Book III. of the
present edition. The Phanerogams are divided into
three classes, Gymnosperms, Monocotyledons, and Dicoty-
ledons. Our author adheres mainly to the Gymnospermous
theory, and certainly the question whether conifers are
gymnospermous or not' has yet to be decided, notwith-
standing the recent controversy of Eichler and Stras-
burger.
More than one hundred pages are devoted to the

in translating the second book, and these difficulties
seem to have been successfully overcome. We have no
doubt that further experience will suggest changes and
improvements even in the admirable book now before us.
The third book treats of Physiological Botany, and is
divided into seven chapters. The first chapter is devoted
to the molecular forces in the plant, and the second to
the chemical processes in the plant. Naegeli's theory that
organised bodies consist of isolated particles or molecules
between -which water penetrates is here fully described,
and the value of the theory in explaining nutrition and
growth by intussusception pointed out. The movements
of water and gases in plants are also treated of in this
chapter. The second chapter deals with the elementary
constituents of the food of plants, assimilation and meta-
tastasis, and respiration in plants. Sachs describes the

separation of oxygen and fixation of carbon as assimila-
tion, and limits the application of the term respiration to
the taking up of oxygen and liberation of carbon dioxide.
The influence of external conditions, as temperature, light,
electricity, and gravitation in plants, forms the subject
of the third chapter. The mechanical laws of growth,
including the movements of growing parts, are fully
described in chapter iv. This chapter will be read with
much interest, and many of the statements will be found
to be new to English students. The fifth chapter gives a
careful rtsumf of what is known regarding the movements
met with in full-grown parts of plants, whether periodic
or dependent on the action of stimuli. Chapter vi. is
devoted to the phenomena of sexual reproduction, the
sections on the influence of relationship on sexual cells,
and on hybridisation being of much importance. The
last chapter is devoted to the origin of species, to varie-
ties, and to the Theory of Descent.
In closing the book after giving the above brief sketch
of its contents, we cannot but express our satisfaction at
the manner in which Messrs. Bennett and Dyer have
done their work. The notes appended to the English
edition are of much value, and will assist the student in
his studies. We have but one objection to the work, and
that is its high price as compared with the German
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
edition. Surely the price will be an obstacle in the way
of its extensive circulation. Could anything be done to
obviate this? Sachs himself has already issued the
physiological portion of the third German edition sepa-
rately. Why not permit students to obtain one or other
of the three books separately? Or might not an abridg-
ment be made, somewhat on the principle of Prantl's
Lehrbuch? As a text-book it must exercise a most
powerful influence on botanical teaching in this country,
and while it will supersede all other text-books for
advanced students, we fear that its size and price may
prevent it being so widely used as it ought to be. With
Sachs' text-book within reach, teachers and students will
be themselves to blame if they are behind the time in
botanical science. Then, the English edition being
translated from the third German edition, students can I
readily keep up their knowledge, because the "Bota-
nischer Jahresbericht," beginning as it does in 1873, will
refer them to all the more recent literature. While we
have thus expressed our entire satisfaction with the work
of the translators and annotators, let us not forget to

mends those who can do so "to join a 'mutton club,'
buying the lambs of a full-sized breed, and keeping them
to at least three-and-a-half years old before killing. The
price per pound will not be less than charged by the
butcher, but it will supply an article twice as good as his."
The remarks with reference to eggs are also very much
to the point. "High game has fortunately gone out of
fashion, and the most frequent form in which we now
meet with decomposing albuminoid matter is that of a
fusty egg. Some housekeepers seem to consider this
quite good enough for made dishes, and thus spoil
material worth ten times what they save by their nasty
economy. No egg should be allowed to enter the kitchen
that has the slightest smell of rotten straw."
In accordance with the opinion of most of the medical
profession and of a large body of the public, we read that

reaction against port and sherry will make itself evident

in the considerable diminution of the number of those
who are liable to be attacked with the gout, and so
demonstrate the advantages of the lighter wine.
In the section on the special dietetics of health many
important remarks are to be found. Hints are given to
those who pursue the commercial, the literary, and pro-
fessional life, special chapters being devoted to each.
The regimen of infancy and motherhood, of childhood
and youth, are not omitted. Dr. Chambers is not the
only author who inveighs against afternoon tea, and we
cannot agree with the argument on which his objections
are based. He tells us that " the dilution and washing
away of the gastric secretion weakens its power of digest-
ing the subsequent dinner, improperly blunts the appetite,
and not unfrequently generates flatulence and dyspepsia."
But the gastric juice is not secreted if solid food is not
taken, and any fluid introduced into the stomach can
hardly but be absorbed within a quarter of an hour or so.
The substitute suggested, "a biscuit, and an orange or
an ice," is, in our estimation, much more injurious.

An Elementary Exposition of the Doctrine 0/ Energy.
By D. D. Heath, M. A., formerly Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge. (Longmans, Green , and Co.)
IN this book we have a very good elementary exposition
of the Doctrine of Energy; perhaps, however, better
adapted for the use of schools than for the general public.
Indeed, we are told in the preface that the work was deve-
loped from a set of lectures given to the senior classes of

employed to colour sweetmeats, liqueurs, jellies, &c.,
include some of the most fatal poisons, such as the
acetate, arsenite, and carbonate of copper, chromate and
iodide of lead, and the sulphides of arsenic and mercury.
Indeed, we well remember going over a sweetmeat manu-
factory, and on remarking on the bright yellow colour of
some large comfits we were told that chrome yellow was
employed to produce it, our informant evidently having
no idea that the substance is a most virulent poison. A
long article is devoted to the adulteration and fabrication
of wines, and the "plastering" and "fortifying" of
sherries is discussed at length. In all cases the most
recent results are given, and the work is well edited
and carefully written. A glossary at the end of the book
will be found useful both to the analyst and the student.

"The Unseen Universe"
WE have read with satisfaction (NATURE, vol. xii. p. 41), your
very candid and fair precis of our recent woik, "The Unseen
Universe." There are, however, one or two comments added
in which the writer seems to have misapprehended our meaning,
possibly from the fact tliat in the first edition of such a work the
arrangement may be regarded as not having quite taken its final
shape.
To begin, we fail to understand what the reviewer means when
he says, "It is a mere theological dogma to say that what energy
perishes in the visible passes in'.o the invisible universe; and the
dogma is worthless as a physical principle on which to build any
physical reasoning."
Our views will be found on p. 159 of our book: "May we not
say that when energy is carriia from matter into ether it is carried
from the visible into the invisible?" Surely the ether may be
looked upon as forming part of the invisible universe, and also
as having received a large portion of the energy which was once
attached to visible matter.
Our object was to show that we introduced no new dogma
inconsistent with the received ideas regarding energy, inasmuch
as these contemplate an invisible universe as truly as we our-
selves do.
The second point upon which we would remark is the asser-
tion of the reviewer that by regarding the visible universe as an
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
infinite whole, the argument; on which its end and its beginning
are inferred seem to vanish. In reply to this we would remark,
that even allowing (which we are not disposed to allow) that the
visible universe is infinite, this would not affect our argument
against its past eternity. Our argument (see p. 127 of the book)
is, that the dissipation of the energy of the visible universeproeeids,
pari passu, with the aggregation of mass, and the veiy fact there-
Jore that the lar^e wastes of the unirerse are of finite use is suffi-
cient to assure us that the process cannot have been going on ft-r
ei'er.

should never have returned to hb former home on his own

excessive caution which he also manifested in other things. Be
the explanation of this, however, what it may, as a fact he never

there never was a subsequent occasion upon which any of his

Equilibrium of Gases
IN a former letter (NATURE, vol. xi. p. 486) I ventured to
express an opinion contrary to that of most authorities, that the
temperature of a vertical column of gas at rest would tend to
diminish from below upwards.
I then stated that there was nothing to counteract the ten-
dency to the upward diminution of energy which must result
from gravitation. I am indebted to Mr. S. H. Burbury for pointing

out to me that a counter-action exists in the removal from the
system, at every point of the ascenr, of those molecules whose
vertical energy at that point is nil. The total mean energy of
the molecules may thus remain the same, although a constant
deduction is made from the energy of every molecule remaining
in the system.
Mr. Murphy's argument (NATURE, vol. xii. p. 26) from the
absence of cumulus in the Arctic regions, is also a sound one as
far as il goes, and fairly counterbalances that derived from tro-
pical calms and storms.
I must therefore withdraw my dissent from the generally
received doctrine of the tendency to equality of temperature io a
vertical column. R. C NICHOLS

of eleven of them in some date of December. On the 291)1 of
December a full-grown she-wolf, in milk, was brought to me,
with seven cubs, which appeared to be about a week old. She
had ten teats. The eyes and ears of the cubs were closed; their
ears were drooping; their general superficial colour was sooty
brown, with an under colour, that is, at the roots of the hairs, of
dirty light tan. The latter colour was more marked on the
head and flanks, while the sootinc^s was more decided on the
hinder part of the body. They all had a milk-white chest-spot
varying in size. Six of them had white hairs at the tips of their
tails.
All those I 'examined, of about this same age, had simil ir
characters. When the eyes of young wolves open, and they
begin to crawl, about the third week, their general colour is a
dirty light tan, washed with soot. As they grow, their ears
become erect, their general colour a uniform light tan, with only
the tips of the hairs dark, the tail being the darkest part of the
animal. After the sixth week or so, the white chest-spot
emerges into the light fawn colour of the remainder of the chest,
and a dark collar on the under part of the neck becomes visible.

submitted them to very complete discussion, the results
of which he has just made known. His inferences are
generally opposed to those drawn by Klinkerfues and
Oppolzer. With one of the systems of elements given
by the latter, he calculates the apparent path of the
comet from Nov. 30 to Dec. 8, finding, as was to be
expected, a good agreement with Pogson's observations,
and with the rate of motion in R. A. given by his com-
parisons on the first morning, that of Dec. 3, but the
ephemeris does not agree with the rate of motion on the
following morning, which, Pogson's differences are sufficient
to prove, had not diminished. And it should here be ob-
served that the differences of R.A. were evidently obtained
with considerable precision, as might be looked for from
so practised an observer as Mr. Pogson. The orbit here
referred to is as follows :—Mean anomaly, Dec. 3-0
Berlin time, — 5° 6''8; longitude of perihelion, 141° 9';
ascending node, 244° 34'; inclination, 10° 28'; angle of
excentricity, 54° 17', the semi-axis major being that
assigned by Michez for Biela's Comet, and corresponding
to a mean daily motion of S30*'1- Again, Bruhns ob-

serves that it speaks further against the identity, that by
all the ephemerides, at least from Nov. 23 to Dec. 3, the
first days in the northern and later in the southern hemi-
sphere the comet should have been more conspicuous
than at the time of Pogson's observations, and it is
unlikely that it would have escaped notice, particularly in
the northern hemisphere. He so far agrees with Oppolzer,
that no assumed date for perihelion passage will bring
about an agreement of places calculated from the elements
of Biela, with those observed; and that an extension of
the comet's period of revolution to 2528 days, without a
near approach to the planet Jupiter, is most improbable.
In Oppolzer's orbit given above, the inclination is 10° 28',
while that deduced by Michez is 12° 22'; and to prove that
such diminution is not to be accounted for by perturba-
tion during the assumed near approach of Biela to the
earth about the time of the meteor-shower, he has calcu-
lated the effect of the earth upon the elements of Biela,
with the perihelion passage fixed to Dec. 2775, the epoch
which would occasion the nearest approach of the two
bodies. The inclination of the orbit to the ecliptic is
found to be increased i'-6 only, the node is advanced o'-4,
the perihelion longitude f^, and the angle of excentricity
is diminished i'-6. The earth's perturbations during such
a near approach as is possible in the orbit of Biela (for
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
1866) would not therefore account for a change of ele-
ments sufficient to represent the places of Pogson's Comet.
Bruhns then makes two assumptions with regard to the
ratio of the curtate distances of the comet from the earth
at the times of the Madras observations on Dec. 3 and 4,
and in both cases arrives at retrograde orbits : the motion
of Biela's Comet is direct. The first of these orbits from
which he computes an ephemeris is as follows (we adapt
the longitude of perihelion and the inclination to the
catalogue form of expressing them):—Perihelion passage
1872, Dec. 15-3763 Greenwich time; longitude of peri-
helion, 332° 28'; ascending node, 33° n ; inclination,
31° 13'; perihelion distance, 0-035205. Hence the track
of the comet would be—

Cavicornia, in being independent ossifications, situated,

median excrescence on the foreheaJ, in front of the

The Pronghorn (Antilocapra) has well-developed horns.
They are attached to ordinary bony cores, exactly similar
to those of the Antelopes. They are, however, unique of
their kind in that they are branched or bifurcate at their
tips, a second smaller point springing from the anterior
margin of the flattened stem, and running forward with a
gentle curve, convex upwards. In another respect these
horns are even more peculiar. Mr. Bartlett, the Super-
intendent of the Society's Gardens, was the first to show,
from a specimen living in the Card ens, that the Pronghorn
is in the habit of annually shedding its horns from off
their cores. This surprising discovery has since bren
fully confirmed; at the end of each season the core being
found covered with a skin from which the fresh horn is
developed.

Respecting the geographical distribution of the Cavi-
cornia, none are to be found in Australasia or in South
America. Very few inhabit North America; the Big-
horn Sheep, one of the Bisons, the Musk Ox, the Moun-
tain Goat, and the Pronghorn embracing them all. Africa
is the head-quarters of the sub-order, and specially of the
Antilopine family. In Europe the Bison is a native of
Poland, the Chamois and the Ibex of the Alps; whilst
the peculiar Saiga reaches our side of the Caspian Sea.
Among the best known Indian Antelopes are the Sasin
or Antelope par excellence, and the Nilghau.
The Chevrotains, or Tragulidas, form a group of small,
deer-like animals, without horns, which were formerly
associated with the Musk Deer. The investigations of
Prof Flower have, more than any others, proved the in-
dependent nature of the group, which approach in their
internal anatomy to the Pigs. Tiie third stomach of
other Ruminants—the Psalterium—is wanting. In the
axis vertebra, the odontoid process, instead of being
scooped into a spout, as in the Deer and Antelopes, is
peg-like, as in the Swine. The second and fifth meta-
carpal bones are completely developed from end to end,
and the lateral marginal intervals of the upper jaw
between the canine and molar teeth are not cut away, as
they are in other Ruminants. These and other pecu-

the sub-order as an independent one, ranking with the
others previously described. The number of genera and

pying much the same ground as does the Chimpanzee. In it
the metacarpal bones remain separate during the life of
the animal, as in the Swine, and not in the other Ruminants.
The fur is spotted like that of most young deer, through-

struction. It is not, however, only by the automatic
process that the full transmitting capacity of a con-
ducting wire can be attained. Metallic conductors under
certain conditions are capable of transmitting more than
one current at the same instant of time, both in the same
and in opposite directions; and by a very ingenious
system of adjustment of electric resistances and balance
of currents, perfected by Messrs. Stearns, Edison, and
Prcscott, the American electricians, intelligence can be
transmitted and recorded over a single wire in opposite
directions at the same moment. This system of trans-
mission is known as " Duplex" and " Quadruplex " Tele-
graphy, and is already extensively employed by the West-
ern Union Telegraph Company in the United States, and
over several of the more important circuits in Great Britain.
The " Duplex " system is working in America between
nearly all the principal cities, and has recently been in-
troduced between Poit Hastings, on the island of Cape
Breton, where the land circuits are in connection with
the submarine cables, and San-Francisco, a distance
little short of 5,000 miles. The "Quadruplex" system
has been successfully introduced between New York and

Boston, with a transmitting capacity upon a single wire
equivalent to the transmitting power of four wires worked
upon the ordinary Morse system. Thus, by employing
arrangements such as the " Duplex" and " Quadruplex,"
a circuit may be worked cither as one wire, or two, three,
or four wires, according as the transmitting capacity of
the circuit may require to be increased.
As is well known, several sounds may be conveyed at
one and the same time by vibrations through a rod with-
out interference, and it is difficult to realise the accuracy
with which every vibration is reproduced by anyone who
has not witnessed an illustration of the "transmission of
sound " by solid conductors. So it is with " Duplex" and
"Quadruplex" transmissions through the same wire in
opposite directions at the same moment of time; it is
equally difficult to realise how distinct signals can be
received at either end without interfering with or destroying
each other; and yet the principles involved are very
simple and easy of explanation.
By the Duplex system, one of the most difficult problems
incident to the successful development of telegraphic lines
has been solved, namely, how to provide for the annual
increase (averaging 20 per cent.) in the amount of busi-
ness without the annual expenditure on capital account
for the erection of additional wires. In the United States,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
over 150,000 miles of wire are in operation, the rate of
increase being something like 20,000 miles per annum,
and the Duplex system is capable of doubling the carrying
capacity of these wires. The great value of the Duplex
system consists in its capability to double the capacity
of a wire at any moment, should injury by storm or
conflagration interrupt the circuits. By its means, the
moment one wire is restored to continuity it becomes
equivalent to two, and a second wire raises the carrying
capacity of the circuits to four wires, and by skilful
manipulation the system may be introduced and adjusted
on a circuit in about a minute. From the earliest
days of telegraphy it has been well known that two
currents, either in the same or in opposite directions,
could be passed simultaneously through a conducting
wire; indeed, by this means, often has the frame of
mind and temper of the operator at the distant station
been clearly read at the receiving station, even though
situated some hundred miles distant. When the direc-
tion of the currents from the two stations are passed
into the wire in the same direction, the directive force

telegraph from 1844, the date at which this story com-

first mentioned Charles Wheatstone, Professor of Natural
Philosophy at King's College, London, was at the same

connection with the electric telegraph were carried out,
and many of the drawings connected with the filing of
the specifications of those patents were, by permission of
the directors of the East and West India Dock Company,

It is a matter of history that the early telegraph patents of
Cooke and Wheatstone were disposed of for a sum of
120,000/. to a Company called the Electric Telegraph Com-
pany, in which the late John Lewis Ricardo, M. P. for Stoke-
upon-Trent, was at once the mainspring and vital element.
Of this amount Cooke retained 90,000/., and Wheatstone
received 30,000/. This sum included the transfer to the
Company, besides other matters, of the telegraph line
between Paddington and Slough, on the Great Western
Railway, already alluded to in the earlier pages of this
summary. As already mentioned, this short line was a
kind of Madame Tussaud—daily advertisements,
and a profusion of visitors entertained, or, as
they imagined, duped or bamboozled, at one
shilling a head, into the belief that standing be-
fore the little instrument in the Paddington
station, it would there and then convey their
thoughts, and in intelligible language return a
response from a station some twenty miles dis-
tant. Inquiries as to the "time of day," " state
of weather," or general health of the operator,
served to test the accuracy of the new invention.
Nevertheless, nine out of every ten persons who

for their shilling charge. The announcement as

THE INDIAN TRIGONOMETRICAL SURREY*

they are concerned to such a large extent with the peculiar

Gulf of Manaar have been reconnoitred, with a view to
connecting the triangulation of India with that of Ceylon,
which has been found to be feasible.
Probably the most important features in the operations
of the principal triangulation of the year are the re-
sumption of the chain of triangles in Burmah, and the
completion of the Bangalore Meridional Series for the
revision of the southern section of the Great Arc.
Referring to the revision of certain important triangu-
lations which were originally executed at the commence-
ment of the present century with very inferior instruments,
Colonel Walker expresses his conviction that no portion
of the principal triangulation remains which will ever
require to be revised, and that the last of the old links
in all the great chains of triangles which might with any
reason have been objected to as weak and faulty, have
now been made strong and put on a par with the best
modern triangulation.
The pendulum observations have been completed, and
the final results are now being computed and prepared

Considerable assistance was, moreover, rendered to

The reports of the various district superintendents are
very full, and contain a good deal that is of general
interest; the accompanying district sketch-maps are of
great use in enabling one to read these reports with
understanding. We shall briefly refer to some of the
points of more general interest.
In Major BranfUl's report on the Bangalore Meridional
Series, a very interesting phenomenon is noticed in con-
nection with the Cape Comorin base-line. The operations
of 1873-74 were intended to close in a side of the polygon
around the base-line which had been completed in
1868-69! out it vvas found that one of the two stations on
the side of junction had disappeared. This station was
situated on a remarkable group of Red Sand Hills,
where, in 1808, Col. Lambton had constructed a station
by driving long pickets into the drift sand ; in 1869 Major
Branfill, rinding no trace of these pickets, had caused a
masonry well to be sunk to a depth of ten feet, where it
reached what was believed to be firm soil below; but
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
during the interval of four years this well had been under-
mined, and nothing remained thereof but some scattered
dtbris. It would appear that the sand hills travel pro-
gressively in the direction from west-north-west to east-
south-east, which is that of the prevailing winds in this
locality; if Col. Lambton's station was situated on the
highest point of the hills and in a similar position rela-
tively to the general mass as Major BranfiU's, then the
hills must have travelled a distance of about 1,060 yards
to the E.S.E., for the results of the triangulation show
that this is the distance between the positions of the two
stations; thus the rate of progression would be about
seventeen yards per annum. From Major BranfiU's
Notes on the Tinnevelly district, which are appended to
the General Report for 1868-69, it appears that certain
measurements of the eastward drift had made it as much
as 440 yards in the four years 1845-48 ; but the distance
between the trigonometrical stations of 1808 and 1869
probably affords the most accurate measure which has
hitherto been obtained of the rate of progress of this
remarkable sand-wave, which gradually overwhelms the

exceeds the diameter of the float; the cylinders were
made up in sections of fifty inches in length, the lowest
of which is closed below with an iron plate, and the whole,
when bolted together, forms a water-tight well, into which
water can only enter through the piping for effecting the
connection with the sea. The piping is of an internal
diameter of two inches, which has been computed to be
sufficient to permit of the transmission of the tidal wave
to the well without sensible retardation. Iron piping is
laid from the well to the line of low water; it is brought
vertically up from the bottom of the well nearly to the
surface of the ground, and is then carried down to the
sea, where flexible gutta-percha piping is attached, and
carried into the deep water. The outer piping terminates
in a "rose," which is suspended a few feet above the bed
of the sea by a buoy, in order to prevent the entrance of
silt as much as possible, and it can be readily detached
from the iron piping whenever it has to be cleaned.
After many difficulties, and even dangers to life, Capt.
Baird's party managed to get the gauges erected and set to
work, and what with the tidal observations, observations of

the barometric pressure, the velocity and direction of the
wind, and the amount of rainfall—for each station has
been provided with means for making such observations-
very valuable results may be expected.
Lieut. Gibbs's notes on the portion of the Dang Forests,
in the Guzerat district, visited by him in 1874, are of great
interest, and we regret that space forbids us referring to
them in detail. His observations on the inhabitants of this
region are of special value; he also seems to have paid
considerable attention to the fauna, flora, and geology of
the district.
Capt. Heaviside's lively narrative of the pendulum work
in India, of his journey home, and of the operations at
Kew, will also be read with interest.
Two narratives of somewhat unusual interest are given
in the Appendix. One of these, by Lieut.-Col. Mont-
gomerie, gives an account of a journey to the Namcho or
Tengri NiSr Lake, in Great Thibet, about ninety miles
north of the Brahmaputra, by a native explorer, during
1871-72. The explorer was a semi-Thibetan, a young man
who had been thoroughly trained for the work, and who
was accompanied by four assistants. The party set out
from Kumaon in November, and crossed the Brahma-
putra at Shigatze, and amid considerable hardships made
their way northwards, reaching the lake about the end of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
January, when they found it completely frozen over,
although the water is so salt as to be unfit for drinking.
The party intended to travel all round the lake, which is
15,200 feet above the sea, fifty miles long and from six-
teen to twenty-five miles broad, and intended to proceed
further to the northward and take complete surveys, but
were robbed of nearly all they had, and were thus com-
pelled to beat a rapid retreat, which they did by way of
Lhasl
During the great part of his journey to the Namcho
Lake the explorer found the streams all hard frozen, and
he was consequently much struck by the number of hot
springs that he met with, and more especially by the great
heat of the water coming from them, his thermometer
showing it to vary from 130° to 183° Fahrenheit, being
generally over 150°, and often within a few degrees of the
boiling point, being in one case 183° when the boiling
point was 183^°. The water generally had a sulphurous
smell, and in many cases was ejected with great noise and
violence ; in one place the force was sufficient to throw
the water up from forty to sixty feet. These springs in

Dcr tfaturfmrscher, Feb. 1875.—This valuable publication

most of which are noticed separately in NATURE; but there are
also numerous original papers. We point out the following :—
On the elements of the flora of the Chalk period, by C. v.
Ettingshausen.—On the nature of lichens, by P. Magnus. This
is an account of the difference of opinion existing amongst the
authorities on the subject in question, some of whom do not
think lichens uniform organisms, but rather suppose them to
consist of a fungus which draws the greatest part of its organic
substance from the Algae (the so-called lichen Gonidia) round
which it grows, while others do not agree with this view ; the
author, however, tends to the adoption of the idea as a correct
one.—On the Biela Comet shooting stars observed by Herr
Winnecke at Strasburg on Dec. 3 last.—On the revival of
Rnlifera, by Mr. Leidy.—On the atmospheric peroxide of hydro-
gen, by Herr Houzeau.—On the colour and specific gravity of
sea-water; observations made on board the German Expedition
corvette Gazelle on her voyage to the Kerguelen Island, under
the superintendence of Herr von Schleinitz. These observations
seem to show that the blue colour of sea-water stands in close
relation with the quantity of salt the water contains, and that as

the salt decreases the colour passes from blue,' to blue-green and
dark green. There seems to be such regularity in this, that
simply according to the specific gravity of the water the shade of
colour could be determined which the water must show, and
vice versd. The transparency of the water seems also to inciease
with its quantity of salt; that of blue water was found to be 47
meters, while that of dark green only 2'5 meters.—On the
nature and the laws of adhesion, by J. Stefan.—On the assimila-
tion of nitric and sulphuric acids by germinating peas, by Herr
Kellner.—New researches on some absorption phenomena of
field-soils, by Herr Eichhorn.—On the spectra of comets, by

tion of albumen, by R. Maly.—On a new method to investigate
the nature of electric discharges, by Herr A. M. Meyer.—On a
new theory of the sensation of light, by Herr E. Hering. This
theory refutes that of Young and Helmholtz, which adopts three
simple colours, red, green, and violet, and sometimes requires
certain psychic processes for explaining certain facts. Herr
Hering tries to do away with these processes in question.—On

instrument was fully explained by the inventor at a recent meet-
ing of the Meteorological Society.
March I.—The subject of rain and the barometric minimum
is here further discussed by Prof. Reye, who finds that his views
agree in the main with those of Herr Hann. Both these meteo-
rologists recognise the latent heat of vapour as moving force in
rotating storms; this causes the air to ascend and fresh air to be
drawn in. According to Herr Hann, the barometer only sinks
fast after a large whirl with a strong ascending current has been
formed. Prot. Reye agrees with him in thinking that the rota-
tory movement contributes to rarefaction in the centre and thus
renders possible the occasional long duration of minima. But
he differs with him regarding another point. He considers that
the ascending central current can only last so long as its tem-
perature, derived from condensation, exceeds that of the sur-
rounding air, and that this higher temperature must make
pressure lower beneath the ascending current than around the
cyclone. Dr. Hann, on the contrary, affirms that condensation
has little effect on pressure, and that tie minima of storm-centres
are not caused by rainfall Mohn's theory of the propagation of
storms in the direction of largest rainfall cannot hold good if the

conical space having the main point of the conductor for its

small oscillations of the barometer, by the Hon. Ralph Aber-
cromby. These small oscillations of the barometer (sometimes
called "pumping") have long been associated with gusts of
wind, but the precise nature of their action has not |been deter-
mined. The author gives two examples as typical:—i. Win-
dow looking S., wind nearly S., in strong gusts. In this case
the first motion of the barometer was always upwards about
o-oi inch, as if the effect of the wind being arrested by the
house was to compress the air in the room. 2. A corner house,
one window to S., another to W., wind S. in strong gusts. With
the W. window open there were violent oscillations, but in this
case the first motion was always downwards. On opening the
S. window as well, the pumping ceased. The explanation seems
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to be, that the wind blowing past the W. window drew air out of
the room, but when the S. window was opened as much air
came in as was drawn out, and the pumping ceased. It is well
known to medical men that many acute diseases are aggravated
by strong winds; and the author has observed this distress to be
associated with the pumping of the barometer. He suggests the
following practical methods of palliation :—If windows can be
borne open, try by crossing, or otherwise altering the drafts,
to diminish the distress. When, as in most cases, windows
cannot be open, all doors and windows should be closely shut,
as well as the vent of the chimney, if there is no fire; and, if
possible, the patient should be moved to a room on the lee side
of the house.—Proposed modification of the mechanism at pre-

THE ARCTIC MANUAL
Manual of tin: Natural History, Geology, and Physics of
Greenland and tlie Neighbouring Regions. By T.
Rupert Jones, F.R.S., and W. G. Adams, M.A., F.R.S.
Edited by Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., under ihe
direction of the Arctic^Committee of the Royal Society.
(Published by authority of the Admiralty, 1875.)
THE Arctic explorers, to whom we must all give a
hearty God-speed now they have started on their
journey,besides being supplied with " Instructions" as to
the points on which information is most required, and as to
the manner in which they may best obtain it, have had
compiled for them a most comprehensive " Manual" of
what has already been done with regard to the natural
history and physics of the northern regions. The time
devoted to this work has been short, but the compilers
have made the most of it, and their names are guarantees
that the information is as complete as possible.
The book consists of a series of reprints of the latest
and most trustworthy papers that have been written
on the various subjects included. No other form of
"Manual" would have been half so useful, even if there

had been time to compile it. The limited area within
which the exploration is to be conducted has made it
possible to include all these in one handy volume. What
would not an ordinary naturalist give to have all the pre-
vious work that had been done upon the district he was
visiting collected together for him, instead of his having
to search for it over scattered volumes? and how much
more valuable it would be if it were revised up to the
latest date by the authors themselves. This is what has
been done for the Arctic naturalists, who will tie cut off
lor years from all books but those they take with them,
and to whom this work will therefore be of inestimable
value. Of course we are not to understand that all that
has been written on the natural history and physics of
the Arctic regions is here reproduced ; that would have
been impossible: but in the first part complete catalogues
are given, without the descriptions of the genera or species
that have been named from Arctic specimens; and the
second part, to which less time has been allowed, and
which is less complete, contains only the most important
portions of the papers or works from which extracts have
been made.
It is not the Arctic voyagers, however, who alone will
benefit by this Manual. Those who will follow them in
thought in their perilous but splendid undertaking will

find their interest increased, if this be possible, by the
many questions for solution which its perusal will raise in
their minds, and they will the more easily compare what
was known before the expedition with that which we hope
will be known after its return.
We proceed to give our readers some idea of the con-
tents of this " Manual." Although the list of papers is
no doubt scanty compared with what might be formed of
more temperate climes, many no doubt will be astonished
that so much has been done in the natural history of
these inhospitable regions, far more m proportion than
the observations of physical data.
The first part, devoted to Biology and Geology, is

inhabitants of great depths, and consequently rare in
collections, eighteen only being well represented in
those of Britain.
Dr. Morch's list of the Mollusca, including land, fresh-
water, and marine forms, reaches a total of 216, which are
arranged after his own modification of Latreille's classifi-
cation. As this is not the classification usually adopted
or known in England, it may be well to indicate it. The
Mollusca proper are divided into five classes. The first,
Androgyna, Morch, includes the five orders: Gropliila,
Fer., or land shells; Hy^rofihila, Fe"r., or freshwater
shells ; Pfenoglessata, Trochsel; Gymuobranchia, Cuv.;
and Pieropoda, Cuv. The second class, Dioica, Latr., is
divided into the three ordeis, Tcenio-, TQXO-, and Rhachi-
glossata of Trochsel, after the characters of their tongues.
The third class, Exocephala, Latr., is divided in the same
way, into Rhipido- and Heteroglossata; while the remain-
ing two classes, Cephalopoda andAceJ>kata,a.Te undivided,

orders as usually distinguished in the latter class. The

under the title of Brachionopoda. The Tunicata number
thirteen species, and require revision, while the Polyzoa
mount to sixty-three. Of the Insects nothing is recorded
since Schiodte's list in 1857 of 114 species; of Arachnida
there are almost none but a few Acari. The list of
Crustacea is a large one, and has been revised by Dr.
Liitken for this Manual. The whole number is 184, of
which no less than seventy are Amphipoda. Yet this list
is plainly incomplete, the Ostracoda being represented
by one species only, while in the next paper Dr. Brady
enumerates twenty-four from their shells. The other
classes of animals have similar lists. In the Annelids
most families are represented by a few species; the
various Entozoa are tabulated. The Echinoderms are
thirty-four, containing only one Echinid: the remaining
lists are short ones, except that of the fixed Hydrozoa,
and the Sponges, which are pretty numerous. It is
useless, of course, to catalogue "species" of Fora-
minifera, and only a few notes are accordingly given of
the various generic forms which have been met with at
various depths, with a description of the nature of the
materials in which they occur.
From animals we pass to plants. The first paper is
the well-known one by Dr. Hooker, "Outlines of the
Distribution of Arctic Plants," from the Linnean Society's
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Transactions for 1861, which has been reprinted with
little alteration, chiefly from want of time, the more
recent discoveries being given in foot-notes. The list of
flowering plants contains those from the districts of
Arctic East America and Greenland only, which number
552, of which about two-fifths are Monocotyledons, and
the remainder Dicotyledons. Mr. Taylor's paper, on the
Plants of Davis' Strait, though without the generalisations
of the former, gives more details on the habitats and loca-
lities of the specimens ; but this paper also is one of old
date (1862). The Cryptogams are enumerated in various
papers on the several sections to which separate students
usually devote themselves; the most important being
Dr. Lindsay's, on the Lichen Flora of Greenland and
other Arctic Regions, from the Transactions of the
Botanical Society of Edinburgh for 1869. As lichens
will grow where nothing else will, their various species
may naturally be expected to make a large figure in an
Arctic flora; and so they actually do, as they number by
themselves half as many as all the flowering plants
together. The Diatoms, which in their vast numbers

collection ot notes by Henry H. Howorth of the several
observations that have established the fact of the rising
of the circumpolar land.
We have now passed in review the chief portion of this
Manual, which occupies 500 out of its 750 pages, and
relates to that portion of the Arctic regions whither the
explorers are in the first instance bound. The remaining
portion of the Natural History division—occupied with
Parry Island and East Greenland—consists of shorter
papers and far barer catalogues. These perhaps require no
observations beyond noticing the fact—recently pointed out
also by Mr. De Ranee in our columns—that the various
geological periods are much better represented in these
latter districts, there being Silurian, Carboniferous, Tri-
assic, and Jurassic, as well as Cretaceous and Tertiary
rocks ; and consequently we have lists of fossils supplied
with which any that may be discovered may be compared.
The last of the Natural History series is an extract from
Mr. Woodward's paper on Glaciation, the object of the in-
sertion of which, as it is entirely theoretical, it is difficult
to understand, unless it be to give the explorers some
idea of the kind of questions on which some of their

geological and glacial observations may be expected to
throw light.
There are two things that strike one in reading these
long catalogues—(i), that he must be a well-informed
naturalist to whom many of the names which belong to
all classes and kingdoms of life are anything more than
names; and (2), arising from this, what an advants.ge
there is in having specific names at least as far as
possible descriptive.
The second part of the Manual, relating to Physics,
requires of course less detail, and is included in a far
smaller number of pages. It is not constructed on ex-
actly the same plan as the first part, but consists in a
great degree in descriptions of the observations and
results, instead of reprints of the original papers; nor is
it so exhaustive. It is divided into eight portions, relat-
ing respectively to Meteorology, Temperature of the Sea,
Formation and Composition of Sea-water Ice, Tides and
Currents, Geodesy and Pendulum Experiments, Observa-
tions on Refraction and on Air, Terrestrial Magnetism,
and the Aurora Borealis. Under the head of Meteorology
we have a few scattered notes on the results of the nume-
rous previous expeditions with the thermometer, baro-
meter, &c., and a valuable table on the mean temperatures
of various stations for the several months of the year.

The information as to the temperature of the sea is still
more meagre, and it seems to us that more might have
been included with advantage. The papers selected on
the Physical Properties of Ice are extremely suggestive
and valuable, consisting partly of observations in Arctic
regions as to the freezing-points of sea-water, and the
compositions of the resulting ice and the remaining liquid,
and partly of similar experiments in the laboratory.
The information also on the tides and currents is pretty
full, showing what methods have been adopted in various
expeditions for determining the former accurately and
with what results. There are also papers of suggestions
as to the probable directions and amounts of both, and
the best places for observation, and on the Meteorology
and Hydrography of the Austro-Hungarian North Polar
Expedition. The part on Magnetism is on the same
model as the last mentioned, and is equally, if not more
valuable. The last chapter, on the Aurora Borealis, is the
best of all. Besides the ordinarily phenomenal obser-
vations already made, great attention is naturally paid to
the spectrum of the Aurora, its connection with electrical

Now, the to'.al width of Ne* Guinea is here 380 miles
only, and the! longest distance possible to go without
reaching the sea is just about 620 miles, which takes you
to the shores of Geelvinck Bay.
The centre of New Guinea is about 6° S. of the
equator, and is almost certainly a forest region through-
out and abundantly watered. In this equatorial belt all
round the globe the temperature is not excessive, 96° or
98° being the extreme daily limit, while the nights are
almost invariably cool (70° to 76°). The greater part of
the country here described is, however, said to be open
plains with only occasional forest tracts; water was not
found for a whole day's journey, even at the foot of a
mountain range 10,000 feet high, and the ordinary daily
temperature is said to have reached io5°to 109° and 115°
in the shade. He describes a terrific storm of hailstones
as large as hens' eggs, not on the mountains, but in the
low country about 7° S. latitude.
His mode of travelling is as extraordinary as his geo-
graphy. After the statement that in the tropics "early
morning and evening are the only times when it is
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:46 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
possible to travel," he assures us that he started at 3 A.M.,
and in the evening continued his journey till 9 P.M. This
gives two-and-a-half hours in the morning and the same at
night of total darkness, in an unknown, pathless, tropical
country, and he even ascends part of a dangerous mountain
full of fissures and huge rocks, till nine o'clock at night!
The country, too, was full of venomous snakes ; and huge
scorpions a foot long, whose sting was certain death
were very abundant; and as these last are nocturnal
animals, travelling in darkness among fissured rocks and
dense vegetation must have been exciting. But then we
are told that he carried a lanthorn, and by means of this
artificial illumination it is to be supposed the whole party
made good progress and baffled the scorpions.
More marvellous still is the ascent of Mount Hercules,
32,783 feet high. He starts with one native from the foot
of the mountain at 4 A.M., carrying "food, water, arms, and
blankets," and ascends 14,000 feet by nine o'clock! At
15,000 feet they came to snow, but continued on for many
thousand feet more, and by I P.M. had reached a height
of 25,314 feet, the temperature being 22° below freezing.
This is certainly good climbing, as it is just 4,000 feet
higher than Chimborazo from the sea-level, and more
than twice as high as Mont Blanc is above Chamouni.
The Alpine Club must hide their diminished heads after

this. Of course, having turned back at one o'clock, our
travellers arrived safely at their camp at 7.30 P.M. A
tinted view of this wonderful mountain forms the frontis-
piece to the book.
Having digested this Alpine feat as best we may, let
us turn to Capt. Lawson's account of the natural history
of the island. It may be premised, for the benefit of non-
zoological readers, that New Guinea belongs to the Aus-
tralian region, and that with the exception of bats and a
wild pig, all the known mammalia are marsupials, four
species of kangaroos, several species of Cuscus (an animal
somewhat like an opossum), and some smaller marsupial
forms being known. The coasts have been visited for
centuries, and considerable excursions have been made
in the interior of the northern part of the island, while
the southern portions have also been several times visited
by our various surveying parties. The islands all round
it agree in this exclusion of all mammalia but marsupials.
But Capt. Lawson tells us quite a different tale. He met
with no solitary kangaroo or Cuscus all through New
Guinea, but he everywhere encountered deer of several

It is a pity that books of this sort are published, as they
can do no good. It is one of that class which attempts
to account for the general features of the earth by some
extravagant hypothesis, for the proof of which some
superficial observations of well-known facts and some
show of quotations from well-known writers are all that
is offered. Who besides the author can believe that the
shape of the earth, deprived of its oceans, would be a
tetrahedron, the four angles representing the four conti-
nents? Yet the author announces himself as following
in the footsteps of Elie de Beaumont in his theory of the
re'scau pentagonal, as the following lucid sentence on
page 2 shows :—" The form (of the earth) is included in
his re'scau triangulairc, and is, as I propose to show, the
six-faced tetrahedron ; the easterly sag or twist of the
southern hemisphere on a twin plane, the apparently
macled form of the crystal, having caused the lines of

relief and depression of the earth's surface to elude solu-
tion whilst the rcseau of that crystal in its simple form
alone was applied to them." We quite agree with the author
that " only the imperfection of the ideas or of the lan-
guage in which they are conveyed can prevent the follow-
ing pages being intelligible to every reader." However
untenable De Beaumont's theory was, it was conscien-
tiously and laboriously worked out, and the conclusions
were commensurate with the offered proof, even if they
were erroneous; but Mr. Green, who would be his fol-
lower and improver, jumps to conclusions far wider on
the basis of supposition only. The present short volume
is only the first part of three that are promised on the
figure of the earth, volcanic action, and physiography;
and we must hope that the second part, at least, which is
to contain "observations of the great active volcanoes and
the great extinct volcanic range of the Hawaiian group,"
which the author must have had good opportunities of
making, will be somewhat more solid than this first. Mr.
Green is plainly capable of better things than wild specu-
lation, which anyone can make and no one can prove.
There are no doubt many remarkable features in the dis-
tribution and shape of land and the direction of its coast
lines, some of which arc here pointed out ; but the mean-
ing of these things will only be arrived at by a wider

were seen near the radiant, and that they were generally smaller
and had shorter tracks than the November meteors observed
between 1865 and 1870. The number seen was too small to be
called a shower ; at the maximum, however, the fall per hour
was nearly double that of ordinary nights. In short, I have no
doubt that they were Leonids, and think it highly probable that
they were derived from a distinct cluster which passed its peri-
helion in 1787 and 1820. We have therefore nine recorded
meteor-falls which indicate the existence of a second cluster of
Leonids, viz., those of A.D. 288, 855, 856, 1787, 1818, 1820,
1822, 1823, and 1852. The showers of 855 and 856 may be
somewhat doubtful. If derived from the same meteor-cloud as
the others, the dates would indicate considerable perturbations
either by Uranus or the earth. The displays have been much
less conspicuous than those of the major group, and hence the
phenomena have been less frequently observed. The period is
about 33'33 years, while that of the other swarm, according to
Newlon, is 33'25 years. Since their separation, therefore, the
latter has gained nearly two-thirds of a revolution in their rela-
tive motion. The estimates which have been made in regard to
the recent entrance of the cluster into the planetary system must
consequently be rejected. DANIEL KIRK\VOOD

Systems of Consanguinity
IN NATURE, vol. xi. p. 401, I find a notice of the third
edition of Sir John Lubbock's valuable work on the "Origin
of Civilisation," in which the following paragraph occurs :—
"The facts with which he deals in this chapter [a new
one in that volume] have been taken from the voluminous
work of the American author, Mr. Morgan; but Sir John Lub-
bock, putting aside Mr. Morgan's theorising, has submitted a
view of them of his own. This, in the main, and as far as it
goes, we think, he has made out."
]n the same article the following paragraph also occurs:—
"One of Mr. Morgan's theories (for he has, or seems to have,
two which it is no business of ours to reconcile with each other)
is, that these systems are, to use the words of Sir John Lub-
bock, 'arbitrary, artificial, and intentional.'"
These statements, to the last of which with your permission I
desire to reply, present the "American author" both harshly
and unfairly to the British public. The interpretation of these
systems of consanguinity, thus ascribed to me, is not mine;
neither is the interpretation given in my work on "Systems of
Consanguinity."
There are three or four places, and perhaps more, in that
volume in which I speak of the system of a particular people as
"aitificial and complicated," and as "arbitrary and artificial,"
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
without the qualification in each case which should, perhaps,
have been inserted. Thus, commenting on the same system
(Con. p. 392), I remark that " the chain of consanguinity has
been followed with great particularity, that the artificial and
complicated character of the system might be exhibited, as well
as the rigorous precision with which its mir.ute details are ad-
justed." One who had read my work through could not have
been misled by this statement, which was intended to characterise
this system as it appeared on its face, and apart from all con-
siderations respecting its origin. On the next page but one
(p. 394) the same statement is repeated and qualified as follows:
"As a plan of consanguinity it [the same system] is stupendous

results of great scientific value accrued. Had our great philo-
sophic naturalist not been there, this dust miyht still have fallen
on ships to the present day, been swept away as a nuisance, and
unrecognised as of any possible interest. That errant species
must frequently visit vessels- was shown me on a voyage to the
East a few years ago. Thus, in the early part of September, in
about lat. 12* N. and long. 260 W., a dove flew on board, which,
after resting for a short time, again pursued its journey. In
about lat. 9° N. and long. 250 W. a moth, apparently 5. con-
volvuli, reached the vessel just before the arrival of a squall. In
reply to my inquiries, both the officers and crew stated that these
were simply very common occurrences.
I think we may feel confident that most vessels sailing this
course meet frequently with like objects, and the interest would
be increased by finding whether the same were observed by
vessels still further from the nearest land. Could some means
be devised for obtaining records of these migratory species, or
could some large shipowner be induced to have the same care-

the log-book would ensure the date and approximate latitude
and longitude which would b_ necessary factors in dealing with
this biological question, and would doubtless bear further proof
to Mr. Darwin's view of colonisation by chance or occasional
visitants.
So much might be done by some of our present means of
unendowed research that it seems weary waiting for the day
when a broader education will tend to induce our sailors to
reap that abundant harvest of scientific information which they
so constantly have the means of acquiring. There is surely
some branch of science which might be indebted to every vessel
that sails from this country on a foreign voyage, could the pre-
liminary information and impetus for inquiry be given to the
officers or crew. I believe the "Religious Tract," or some
kindred society, provides many of our vessels with devotional
literature; could not our learned societies also compile and pro-
vide some scientific works and questions for solution which
might be placed in the hands of our sailors, thus affording a
pleasure for a long voyage, and producing effects to be appre-
ciated by science at home?

Hardened Glass
The account of hardened and malleable glass given in
Nature, vol. xi. p. 474, interested me greatly.
It seems hardly possible that a change in the molecular con-
stitution of glass can take place without affecting its optical
properties. May not this glass, therefore, possess refractive and
dispersive powers unlike those of the kind usually employed in
lenses? If it can be made of sufficient purity and is found to
have a higher refractive power, it will enable us to make thinner
lenses with smaller curves, thus contributing to the further im-
provement of optical instruments. James II. Logan

THE COMET OF 1533.—In the catalogues of the orbits
of comets we find two sets of elements for this comet,
both deduced from the observations of Apian between
July 18 and 25, which are contained in his rare work,
Astronomicum Ctrsareum. The first orbit is by Douwes,
who assigned retrograde motion, but in the Berliner
Jahrbuch for 1800, Olbers gives another orbit, equally
satisfactory as regards representing Apian's observations,
in which the heliocentric motion is direct, and he appeared
to think it was not possible to decide which of the two is
to be preferred. In addition to Apian's account of this
comet we have a brief one by Gemma Frisius, who states
that after having been seen about the beginning of July
in 5° (or rather, as Pingre* corrects him, in 15°) of the sign
Gemini, near the star Capella, with 24° of latitude and 48°
north declination, it passed by a westerly motion, or con-
trary to the order of the signs, to the constellation Cas-
siopea, which it traversed, finally disappearing in Cygnus.

though there is some ambiguity about it. Since Olbers
calculated the orbit the Chinese observations have been
published, in the first instance by M. Edouard Biot, in
the additions to the Connaissattce des Temps for 1846,
and more recently in Mr. Williams' work upon Cometary
Observations in China, and it would appear that the
comet moved to the vicinity of JT Cygni, and was last seen
on Sept. 16. If we compare the elements of Douwes and
Olbers with the track thus roughly defined, we see that
the retrograde orbit of Douwes is hardly probable, and
that possibly a modification of the direct orbit of Olbers
would be found to sufficiently represent the path of the
comet, according to Apian, Gemma, and the Chinese
Annals.

from the under one, it was necessary to place a certain
over-weight into the other scale of the balance.
It was found that the separation of the two plates can
be accomplished by any force, however small, only the
time in which the distance of the plates is increased by a
certain fraction through the action of such a force, is all
the greater, the smaller this force is. This time is still
greater if the two plates are in water or in another liquid,
instead of in air. To give an idea of this we may mention
that the distance of two plates, of 155 millimetres dia-
meter, under water, which originally was o-i mm., was
increased in consequence of the continuous pull of
1 gramme by o'oi mm. only in \\ minutes, by o'i mm.
only in 7 minutes.
Herr Stefan in his experiments measured the time that
passed while the original distance of the plates increased
by a certain fraction. First, the law was established for
the motion of the plates in liquids as well as in air, that
the times stand in the reverse proportion to the separating
force. With the same overweight they are the longer,
the smaller the original distance of the plates, but this in

a far greater than a simple proportion; they increase
nearly in square proportion if the distance of plates de-
creases in a simple one. For different sized plates the
times in question stand in the proportion of the fourth
powers of the semi-diameters of the plates; for different
liquids in the same proportions as the times which elapse,
while equal volumes of these liquids flow through a capil-
lary tube, under equal pressure.
It results clearly that with this phenomenon there rests
a problem of hydrodynamics and not of molecular forces.
The phenomenon can be explained in the following
manner:—When the separating force begins to act, the
distance of the plates is increased by an infinitely small
part. The space contained between the plates is thus
enlarged, the liquid therein contained is dilated, and con-
sequently its hydrostatic pressure decreased. The over-
pressure of the exterior liquid acts against the separating
force. No equilibrium is, however, attained, because the
decrease of hydrostatic pressure between the plates causes
an inflow of the exterior liquid and thus a decrease of
the difference of pressure. The distance of plates may
be again increased by the separating force, and then the
same process is repeated in a continuous manner.
Herr Stefan has therefore given the name of apparent
adhesion to this phenomenon. He has tried to deduce
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
theoretically all the different laws to which the different
experiments have led him; he has succeeded in finding
an equation which expresses these laws, and which at the
same time permits the deduction of the co-efficients of
interior friction of the liquids experimented with, directly
from the experiments. The values of the coefficients
obtained in this manner correspond almost exactly with
those obtained by the experiments of Poisseville, Maxwell,
and O. E. Meyer. But as Herr Stefan thinks the theore-
tical solution of the problem only an approximate one,
we reserve further details on the subject.
If we rub a wet cloth quickly over a glass tube,
closed at both ends, it is caused to vibrate longi-
tudinally. If at the same time it gives its lowest
longitudinal note (as we will suppose for the sake of
simplicity), then the end planes of the tube strike quite
periodically against the air enclosed in it, and cause the
same to vibrate. These vibrations are isochronous with
those of the tube itself. They proceed from both ends of
the tube towards one another, and, as a consequence,
standing waves are formed in the enclosed air column.

MAGNETO-ELECTRIC MACHINES*
FEW discoveries in physical science have been more
important in themselves, or richer in practical
results, than Faraday's discovery of the induction of

and original facts. CErsted's grand discovery, which
linked together electricity and magnetism, had already
yielded a scientific harvest of uncommon richness. It
led immediately to the construction of electro-magnets
vastly exceeding in power any permanent magnets which
were then known or have since been made. The mul-
tiplier or galvanometer of Schweigger supplied a new
and important instrument for measuring electrical cur-
rents, which, with a little modification, becarre the electric
telegraph. Faraday discovered the lotatory character of
currents by means of a steel magnet—was in 1831 com-

pletely solved in the exhaustive memoir by Faraday, in
which he announced the discovery of the induction of
electrical currents. It may be interesting to describe,
nearly in his own words, Faraday's original experiments.
Two helices of insulated copper wire were passed
round a wooden block, the ends of the wire of one helix
being connected with a voltaic battery, and those of the
other with a galvanometer. So long as the current from
the battery passed through the first helix
the needle of the galvanometer remained
motionless, but on breaking the connec-
tion with the battery, a momentary cur-
rent, as indicated by the galvanometer,
traversed the wire of the second helix.
The direction of this current was the
same as that of the primary current of
the battery. When the first helix was
connected with the battery, another mo-
mentary current traversed the second
helix, but in this case it was in the oppo-
site direction to the primary current.
Substituting for the first helix and the
voltaic battery a permanent steel magnet
or an electro-magnet, Faraday found that
on introducing one end of the magnet

into a hollow helix a temporary current
was produced in the wire of the helix in
one direction, and on withdrawing it an-
other temporary current occurred in the
opposite direction. For artificial magnets
the magnetism of the earth may be sub-
stituted, and thus electrical currents can
be obtained by induction from the mag-
netic conditions which everywhere prevail on the sur-
face of this globe. The singular phenomenon first
described by Arago, and afterwards elaborately inves-
tigated by Babbage and Herschel, that when a copper
plate is rotated below a freely suspended magnet the
latter tends to follow the motion of the plate, was shown
by Faraday to arise from electrical currents induced by
the magnet in the rotating metallic disc.
Soon after the announcement of these important
results, Pixii constructed in Paris the first magneto-
electric machine. I have still a vivid recollection of this
machine as I saw it in Pixii's workshop. The currents
were obtained by the rotation of a powerful horse-shoe

NATURE
ments or radicles produced by the electrolysis could not
be obtained separately. Pixii is said to have applied a
commutator to his machine in order to obviate this defect.
An important modification of Pixii's machine was soon
after made by Paxton, who caused the armature to re-
volve instead of the permanent magnet. According to
the character of the current required, armatures with
longer or shorter wires were employed. A large machine
of this construction, exhibited some years ago at the
Polytechnic Institution in London, was capable of
igniting a short platinum wire. In Clarke's machine
the position of the armature was altered and an im-
proved commutator applied. Siemens afterwards, by
giving the armature a cylindrical form, rendered it more
compact and better fitted for rapid rotation.
Siemens' armature was happily applied by Wilde, in
1866, to the construction of a machine of extraordinary
power. Starting from a small magneto-electric machine
provided with six steel magnets, each weighing one
pound, and capable of carrying about ten times their
weight, Wilde transmitted the direct current from this

machine through the coils of an electro-magnet provided
like the former with a Siemens' armature, and the direct
current from the latter he in like manner transmitted
through the coils of another large electro-magnet— so
large, indeed, that its armature alone weighed above one
third of a ton. This was also provided with a Siemens'
armature. When the machine was in full action it
melted a rod of iron 15 inches in length and a quarter
of an inch in diameter, and gave the most brilliant illu-
minating effects when the discharge took place between
carbon points. As nearly as could be estimated, the
mechanical force absorbed in producing these results
was from eight to ten-horse power. Wilde's machines
have been successfully employed by Messrs. Elkington
for the precipitation of copper and other metals, and he
has lately proposed some important modifications to
adapt them to the production of the electric light.
Some years before Wilde's experiments were published,
Holmes had constructed on the Saxton principle a powerful
magneto-electric machine, which has been successfully used
at Dungeness and other lighthouses, and machines differ-
ing little from Holmes's are employed in some of the
French lighthouses. In Holmes's original machine forty-
eight pairs of compound bar-magnets were arranged for
the armatures (160 in number) to revolve between the

poles of the magnets, and by a system of commutators
the current was obtained always in the same direction.
Its amount, however, varied at almost indefinitely short
intervals from a maximum to one-half of that amount.
In practice these variations were wholly inappreciable.
The first suggestion of a magneto-electric machine
capable of giving a continuous current always in the
same direction is due to Dr. A. Pacinotti, of Florence. In
the nineteenth volume of " II Nuovo Cimento," which was
published in 1865,* Pacinotti describes the model of an
electro-magnetic machine constructed, some time before,
under his direction, for the Cabinet of Technological
Physics in the University of Pisa, whose essential feature
was a novel form of armature to which he gave the name of
"transversal electro-magnet." This armature was formed
of a toothed iron ring, m m (Fig. 1), capable of rotating
on a vertical axis, M m, and having the spaces between
the teeth occupied by helices of copper wire covered with
silk. The wire of the helices was always wound in the
same direction round the ring, and the terminal end of
each helix was brought into metallic connection with the

The results he obtained were not great, but were suffi-
cient to enable him to announce that a magneto-electric
machine could be constructed which would have the
advantage of giving the induced currents all in the same
direction, without the help of mechanical arrangements to
separate opposed currents or to make them conspire with
one another.
From the foregoing analysis of Pacinotti's memoir,
there can be no doubt that it contains a description of the
ring armature which in the hands of Gramme has recently
led to the construction of magneto-electric machines
giving continuous currents of great intensity. I cannot,
however, pass over without notice an extraordinary blun-
der into which Pacinotti has fallen, and which would
render any machine constructed after his model altogether
valueless. By a reference to Fig. 2, which, as well as
Figs. 1 and 3, has been engraved from a photograph of
the plate appended to the original memoir, it will be seen
that the letters N and S are placed at the end of the
diameter of the ring which is at right angles to the line
A B joining the poles of the fixed magnet. That Paci-

notti intended these letters to designate north and south
magnetic poles is manifest from the following passage
among others in his memoir :—" Osserviamo che per
influenza sulla elettro-calamita mobile si formano i poli
opposti alle estremita di un diametro in presenza ai poli
della calamita fissa. Questi poli N S mantengono una
posizione fissa anche quando la elettro-calamita univer-
sale ruota sul suo asse." It is hardly necessary to say
that the positions assigned by Pacinotti for the poles in
an iron ring under the influence of a fixed magnet are in
reality those of the neutral points, or points of no mag-
netism, and that the magnetic poles of the ring are at a
distance of 900 from the positions stated by him. This
mistake has led to a serious blunder in the construction
of his machine, the metallic rollers which carry off the
induced currents being placed, not at the neutral points
(as Pacinotti has himself clearly showed that they ought
to be), but at the poles of the ring. That any effects at
all were obtained from the model at Pisa, we must attri-
bute to the slight shifting of the poles of the ring due to
its rotation. Apart, however, from this unaccountable
error, it can scarcely be disputed that to Pacinotti is due
the merit not only of having devised the ring armature
or transversal electro-magnet, but of having also accu-
rately analysed its mode of action.

processes, for the vertebral arteries to run in on their way
to the brain, are excavated in the sides of the spinal canal

Bactrian Camel there is a partial constriction in it, which
separates off a small proximal cavity, which may be its
homologue.
In the corpuscles of the blood the Tylopoda are unique
among Mammalia, these minute discs being oval instead
of, as in all other members of the class, circular.
Of the Camels there are two species, both domesti-
cated, the Bactrian and the Arabian; the one possessing
two humps -and the other one. A swift variety of the
latter is called the Dromedary. The former inhabits
Turkestan, Persia, Thibet, and Mongolia; the latter
Arabia and Northern Africa. Of the Llamas there are
two wild species which have each of them domesticated
representatives; the feral Guanaco and Vicuna finding
their tame representatives in the Llama and Alpaca.
They are all found in the Cordilleras of the Andes, down
as far as Terra del Fuego. Taking the Tylopoda as a
whole, their geographic range is extremely exceptional.
Closely allied animals, as the Ostrich and the Rhea, are
found in South Africa and South America respectively.

North Africa and Arabia, in some respects, resemble
India, as far as their fauna is concerned. No similar
ties bind Northern Africa with South America, and it
is this which makes the distribution of the Camels and
Llamas so abnormal and so inexplicable, on the assump-

as the Miocene age, when we take as our basis the
assumption that the existing zoological regions are the
remains of a very different distribution of land.

in the practical teaching of Geology which bids fair to
be often and profitably repeated—viz., the working out of
a definite problem in the field, teacher and students

brought against the Highland schists by a fault. Last
year the fault was actually seen by the Class on the other
side of the island in the cliffs of Stonehaven, Accor-

was to trace this dislocation across the country, if possible,

from sea to sea. Such a traverse would at least bring the
pedestrians face to face with some of the finest and least
visited river scenery in Scotland, while it would pro-
bably also impress some geological lessons on their
memory in a way not likely ever to be forgotten. At the
same time it might be successful in discovering some
new points in British geology.
The party mustered at Edinburgh, and proceeded at
once to Stonehaven, where the first day's work consisted
in following the magnificent coast-section which rises
above the sea in the picturesque cliffs of Kincardineshire.
The fault by which the slates and greywackes of the
Highlands have been brought side by side with the
red sandstones and shales of the Lowlands was again
found. The rocks have there been so greatly squeezed
against each other that their line of separation is by
no means so abrupt as it might be expected to be.
Instead of the mass of debris which so often fills up the
space between the cheeks of a large dislocation, there was in

long-continued aqueous erosion.
Another point of interest noted in the course of the
excursion was the fact that Comrie—a locality so long
and widely celebrated for its frequent and sometimes
sharp earthquake shocks—lies almost directly over the
line of the great fault. This fact seems to be the first of
any consequence which has been ascertained in the
attempt to connect the abundance of tremors at that
place with any geological structure of the ground under-
neath. From this brief notice it will be seen that there
was plenty of geological interest and novelty to keep up
the enthusiasm of the party from the beginning to the
close of the excursion. Glodous weather and an endless
variety of scenery added fresh charms to each day's
work, while over the whole came the glee and hearty
exuberance which the free open face of nature could not
but evoke in men who had been working hard together in
town all the winter and spring.

ING IROK AND STEEL
IN accordance with "An Act making Appropriations
for Sundry Civil Expenses of the Government, for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1876, and for other pur-
poses," approved March 3, 1875, and in reply to a
memorial presented to Congress in January last by the
American Society of Civil Engineers, the President of the
United States has appointed a Board with instructions to
determine by actual tests the strength and value of all
kinds of iron, steel, and other metals which may be sub-
mitted to or procured by it, and to prepare tables
which will exhibit the strength and value of these mate-
rials for constructive purposes.
The object of this Board is so admirable, and in this,
as already in some other similar respects, the U.S. has set
an example so worthy of imitation by European Govern-
ments, that we shall be doing a service in publishing the
details of the organisation of the Board. Congress, we
may state, has voted 50,000 dollars to defray the expenses
of the Board.

GUSTAVE THURET
ON the loth of May France lost one of her most dis-
tinguished naturalists. M. Thuret left his home at
Antibes in perfect health, and expired at Nice a few hours
afterwards from an attack of angina pectoris.
Unlike many of his contemporaries, Thuret was not a
voluminous writer. But his papers, though not numerous,
are all extremely admirable, and his work has laid the
foundation of our modern knowledge of the biological
phenomena of the Algae. Probably his earliest paper was
an account of the antherozoids of Chara (1840). He was
the first to detect the cilia upon these structures in any
plant. In 1844 he published an account of the peculiar
mode of asexual reproduction in Nostoc. In 1845, in

conjunction with Decaisne, he described for the first time
the antheridia and antherozoids of Fucus. In 1850 and
succeeding years he published his admirable papers upon
the zoospores of different groups of Alga;. In 1853 he
established for the first time by actual observation, in the
case of F«cus, the existence amongst Algae of the pheno-
menon of fertilisation. In 1866, in conjunction with
Bornet, he described the extremely remarkable pheno-
mena of sexual reproduction amongst the Floridecz.
They found not merely that the process of fertilisation
was accomplished in a very peculiar and remote way, but
also that, besides the effect produced on the germ-cell, a
series of developments were induced in the parent plant
as the result of it. In every group of Alga; the results
which he achieved were of the most fundamental kind.
A man of independent wealth, he passed a great part
of the year on his property at Autibes, on the shore of
the Mediterranean. Bornet, his distinguished collabora-
teur, lived with him. In the gardens which surrounded
his house he had assembled one of the most remarkable
collections of plants to be found growing in the open air
in any part of the world. W. T. T. D.

Arctic regions. No better equipped expedition, it may again
be said, has ever left any country, and no previous British
expedition has ever been so universally popular. Every
available point on land was occupied by spectators who had
come to see the departure of the expedition. The vessels in the
harbour and the yachts and boats along the beach were dressed
with flags, and as the two ships stood out to sea their course lay
through a'perfect flotilla of craft of all kinds, whose occupants
cheered Capt. Nares and his companions on their way. Among
the last messages received by Capt. Nares was a telegram from the
Queen "wishing you and yourgaUant companions every success;"
the telegram was accompanied by a packet, the contents of which
did not transpire. In the morning the Lords of the Admiralty
inspected the ships, and wished the expedition "God speed."

A SCIENTIFIC Society has recently been established in Gains
College, Cambridge, for the diffusion of scientific knowledge
among the members of the College, for the reading of essays on
scientific subjects, and for the holding of scientific discussions.
The Society admits within the range of its discussions all sciences
of observation. An interesting feature in the scheme of the
Society's proceedings is that the first half-hour of each meeting
is to be devoted to open discussion, to the answering of questions
proposed by any member either at the time or at a previous
meeting, or to the exhibition of specimens. The first presi-
dent of the Society is Mr. B. Anningson, M.A., M.B., the
newly-appointed Medical Officer of Health for Cambridge, and
the secretary is Mr. Wm. Ewart. A number of papers have
been read during the present term. The meetings have been
well attended and the discussions well supported.
A SCIENTIFIC Society has been formed at Gloucester, chiefly
in connection with the School of Science there, under the title of
the Gloucester Philosophical Society. A programme of papers
for the year has been issued. In addition to the regular
monthly meetings, a course of six lectures on Structural Botany
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google

course. Gloucester has hitherto been rather apathetic than
otherwise on science ; this looks more healthy.

WE are very much surprised, and on all accounts it is greatly to
be regretted, that the Legislature of Massachusetts has rejected the
Bill for a new Survey of the State to which we have already referred.
Massachusetts is known all the world over as being one of the

the House, showing that the Survey would cost nearly a million
and a half of dollars and occupy nearly a hundred years! Be-
sides an advanced and accomplished calculator, the Massa-
chusetts Legislature is also happy in the possession of a "funny
man," a Mr. Rice, who seems occasionally to relieve the severity
of Mr. Plunkett's extreme calculations by bright flashes of
buffoonery. Mr. Rice described the proposed Survey as "send-

gence and wealth of this great country, in which the whole
visible universe is roughly presented to us, exhibited upon a
colossal yet exact scale, and wherein the actual motions of the
heavenly bodies are visible to the naked eye, wherein vast space
can be spanned by the hand and great epochs of time counted
with ease by the mind."

THE Rev. G. H. Hopkins gives the following method for
fixing the curves which steel filings take when under the action
of a bar magnet. The filings having been prepared so as to be as
nearly the same size as possible, and that size very minute, are
pound into a mortar, and a small quantity of finely powdered
resin is added; these are stirred together until the two sub-
stances are completely mixed, and then, considerable pres-
sure being exerted upon the pestle, they are nibbed until the
resin adheres to the filings in a very fine coating. The filings
can then be sprinkled as usual, and the curves formed. It is
best (after the curves are foimed) to heat the plane surface, glass,
paper, or wood, according to convenience, over a atove or in an
oven, which easily allow it to be sufficiently as well as uniformly
heated. For projecting the curves on a screen, the following,

March 15.—On the relation between differences of atmospheric

Ferrel and Colding, by Dr. Harm. The author begins with a
review of the two theories of storms, .the older of which has
been accepted chiefly in Germany, the other in America
and the Northern States of Europe. According to the
former, whirlwinds are formed mechanically by different streams
of air meeting, and centrifugal force causes the central de-
pression. The more modern theory regards a local depres-
sion as the first condition, causing an indraught resulting in
a whirlwind through the earth's rotation. The primary de-
pression is held to follow condensation of vapour. Probably
there is something right in each of these views. Eddies can,
doubtless, be formed by currents meeting at certain angles, but
the direction of rotation would not be invariable in each hemi-
sphere. Besides, the mechanical resistance to the progress and
continuance of a whirlwind so formed would, without incon-

ceivably favourable conditions, be far too great to be overcome.
Dr. Hann recognises the part played by vapour in storms, but
thinks that many meteorologists rely too much on it in their
need, and points to the works of Hopkins and Laughton for
instances of this partiality. He believes that the greater part of
the low pressure which accompanies storms must be explained
by mechanical laws, and that the local differences of pressure in
a cyclone or even in a straight-blowing current (if such there be)
follow from movements of the air. Condensation may cause a
depression, and that depression we know may cause winds which
produce a depression ten or fifteen times greater. Prof. Ferrel
endeavours to show mathematically that depressions are due to
centrifugal force and the earth's rotation. Colding considers
tropical hurricanes as true whirlwinds, and his values for pressure
from centre to edge reckoned from this hypothesis agree with
observation. Now, there is no reason why centrifugal force
should not act in spirally-whirling storms in relation to radius
and velocity. The earth's rotation adds to the eflect of this
force, and the result is a diminution of pressure towards the
centre on the earth's surface. The enormous extent of some
minima is thus explained, which an ascending current and preci-

respect to the officials at the outlying Observatories, the
assistant at the Central Observatory, and the director of
the Central Observatory, were laid down in the Com-
mittee's Report for 1868, p. 62. Thus, as regards the
thermograph, twenty-seven regulations were laid down,
one of the most important of these being the 25th, by

which it was provided that forty remeasurements from
each month's curves were to be made at Kew, the central
Observatory ; and a table is given (page 39 of the same
Report) of the results of measurements which were
specially designed for the detection of small errors in the
thermograph tabulations, from which it appears that re-
finements as minute as the one-hundredth of a degree
of temperature were taken cognisance of in the results.
Tracings of the curves, and five-day and monthly re-
sults of the tabulations, though not the tabulations them-
selves, have been published, beginning with ist January,
1869; and since then many and great improvements have
been made in representing the curves on the Plates, all in
the direction of greater clearness and precision, for which
the Committee deserve our best thanks. Among the
many valuable results of these curves we may point to
the high temperature at Glasgow on the 2ist April, 1873,
in connection with the remarkable changes in the direc-
tion and force of the wind which occurred at the time;
to the heavy rainfall at Valencia on the 2nd July, 1873, in
connection with the changes of wind, temperature and
pressure ; and to the minute oscillations of pressure at
almost all the Observatories on the 3rd and 4th July,
1873, in connection with the changeable weather at the
time. In these connections the absence of any observa-

tions of clouds is, however, a serious defect.
One of the principal objects for which the seven Obser-
vatories were established was to furnish the data of
observation for the determination of the meteorological
"constants" for pressure, temperature, rainfall, &c., for
different parts of the British Isles. This being now the
seventh year in which this expensive system of observa-
tion is going forward, it may be well to inquire how far
the information, as published by the Meteorological Office,
meets the requirements of the problems to be solved.
Assuming that the curves are correctly traced from the
photographs, we may inquire whether the figures tabu-
lated from these, under the regulations referred to above,

be satisfactorily accurate. No hourly values having been
printed before January 1874, the question can only be
answered by an examination of the printed monthly
maxima and minima, with the days and hours of their
occurrence, as compared with the curves. The following

fewer than two errors. This is the number of errors in
the Table for August 1873 (p. 42 of Q. W. Report for
1873), being the last month for which the whole of the
curves have been published. One of these two errors has
reference to the minimum temperature for Aberdeen (39°"2)
which occurred at 4 a.m. of the nth August, and regard-
ing which the following remark is made in a footnote :—
"Doubtful; instrument out of action immediately after
6 A.m." If we turn to the Aberdeen temperature curve of
the nth (Plate xlv.), we see that the instrument was not
out of order during the whole of that day; and by exa-
mining the curve for the whole month, we see further that
the instrument went out of action on no day at 6 a.m.
and that on the six occasions on which it was out of
order during the month, it is highly probable that in none
of the cases did the temperature fall so low as 39°'2.
Tables of errata for 1869 have been published by the
Office from time to time, the last one appearing in
November 1874. Not one of the numerous errata refer-
ring to 1869, as well as those referring to the other years,
which have been detected in this examination, has yet

appeared in the Tables of errata published by the Office.
Furthermore, these Tables of errata are themselves re-
peatedly in.error ; thus, the last one, printed on the title-
leaf of the Quarterly Weather Report for July—Sept. 1873
contains in the five lines which compose it no fewer than
three mistakes; viz., 1874 being twice printed for 1S73,
and the hour of occurrence of the minimum at Glasgow
being curiously printed as oh 2 a.m., whereas the month
began with the minimum temperature.
As the curves for 1874 are not yet published, there are
no means of checking the hourly tabulatad readings from
the curves. Referring, however, to the regulations laid
down for the detection and correction of small errors,
and to the minute refinement to which the results were to be
carried, viz., to the hundredth of a degree, we were led to
expect that the tabulated readings would be taken from
the curves with an approach to accuracy of at least the
tenth of a degree. A slight inspection of the figures of
the tabulated readings shows at once that this is not the
case, with the single exception of the Observatory at
Stonyhurst.
A word will explain our meaning. There being no
reason why any one of the ten decimal figures, viz.,
•1, '2, '3, . . . "8, -9, 'o should occur oftener than an-
other, it is evident that on the mean of, say, a month's
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
observations, the number of times on which a read-
ing of a whole degree occurred would be, approxi-
mately, a tenth of the whole number of readings. At
Kew, however, out of the whole 744 readings for
January 1874, 172 whole degrees were read off from
the curves and have been printed in the Tables; in
other words, nearly 100 in excess of a due propor-
tion. Next month matters improved at Kew, and only
87 whole-degree readings are given; in March they
rose to 127, and fell again in April to 94. In [this
respect Kew shows the greatest irregularity of all the
Observatories, but more especially as regards the[tabula-
tions from day to day—showing in this respect a marked
contrast with the regular business-like tabulations of
Stonyhurst. Summing up all the whole-degree readings
at each of the Observatories for the nine months, and com-
paring the results with a tenth part of all the readings
tabulated, we obtain the following results :—At Stonyhurst
the number of whole-degrees read off were 16 per cent.,
less than a tenth part of the whole; at the other ob-
servatories the numbers are greater than a tenth part

sidered as contributions to a scientific inquiry into the
climate of these islands.
The Council of the Scottish Meteorological Society, in a
report dated 3rd July, 1872, drew attention to the positions
of the thermometers, particularly those at Aberdeen which
are forty-one feet above the ground and surrounded with
buildings ; giving it as their opinion that " observations so
made were not comparable with each other, nor with other
observations." * The publication since, by the Committee,
of the hourly readings, enables us to examine the point
from the observations themselves. One of the best marked
phases of the daily temperature, as well as one of the
most important, both for scientific and practical purposes,
is the increase which takes place from 9 A.M. to
3 P.M. At Kew the mean increase between these two
hours for January and February 1874 was 4°'8, and
for June and July 60i7—the greater increase in the
summer months being in accordance with the climatic
facts. But at Aberdeen the thermometers indicated
between the same hours a mean increase of 3°-7 for
January and February, and l°'8 for June and'July; thus,

instead of being larger in summer, the recorded.diflerence
was only half that recorded in winter. It is needless
to remark that these results for Aberdeen cannot re-
present the temperature of this part of her Majesty's
dominions, and that for the supplying of data for tem-
perature "constants " for that part of North Britain, the
observations made there are worse than useless. The
arrangements for the thermometers at the seven Observa-
tories, both as regards height above the ground, and
exposure, call for reorganisation.
In Part I. of the Quarterly Weather Report for 1870
(App. pp. 8-10) appears a valuable Table of the mean
monthly readings of the barometer at the Committee's
telegraphic stations. If we were sure that the method
of annual inspection of these stations is a sound one,
the results for Holyhead might suggest an inquiry into
the influence of the sea on the state of the barometer.
The position of the rain-gauges above the ground at
these stations, which varies from five inches to 23 feet
(Q. W. Report for 1873, Part III., p. 44), calls also for
revision.
In all the Reports issued by the Office it will be ob-
served that no monthly mean temperatures for the tele-
graphic stations have yet been published by the Com-
mittee. With reference to these stations, Mr. Symons,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
in December 1869, remarked: "Various facts brought
under our notice convince us that more remains to be
done than has yet been effected, and that in many
respects these stations [telegraphic] are unworthy of the
nation of which they are to a certain extent representa-
tive."-|' We have no means of knowing how far matters
have been rectified. It may therefore be doubted, if the
Office were asked to furnish meteorological information
for the use of the Registrar-General, whether they possess
in their own stations the means of supplying it.
We deeply regret the position we have been forced to
assume in reviewing the work of the Meteorological
Office, but our duty as public journalists leaves us no
choice in drawing attention to the work done in return
for the annual grant by Parliament of ic.ooo/.

the fjords of Greenland, the interior appears covered
with ice; but there is no reason whatever to assume that
this applies to the central part of the country, in which
one, on the contrary, just as well may assume that there
are high mountain chains, which protrude partly from the
ice." Dr. Rink, moreover, thinks the "ice-fjords point
out probably the rivers of the original land, now buried
under ice." At present any statements with regard to the
interior condition of Greenland must be at best conjec-
tural, though all we know seems to point to its being one
sheet of glacial ice, the main flow of the glacier being to
the west rather than to the east.
The remainder of the geographical section is occupied
by some very valuable papers which the Society have
done well to reprint and put in the hands of the members
of the' Expedition. The paper " On the best means of reach-
ing the Pole," by Admiral Baron von Wrangell, is interest-
ing as being the first proposal to attempt to reach the
Pole by the route of Smith's Sound. The paper, moreover,
gives some valuable hints as to the method which ought
to be adopted in attempting an exploration by this route,
and coming as they do from one who has had so great

experience in Arctic exploration, they ought to be received
with great respect. The paper by Dr. Rink, who may
safely be entitled " one of the most eminent living autho-
rities "on many scientific subjects connected with Green-
land, on the discoveries of Dr. Kane, we have already
alluded to. While admitting the valuable contributions
made by Dr. Kane to our knowledge of the geography of
the Smith-Sound route, Dr. Rink justly criticises the
scientific theories broached by Dr. Kane as to the interior
of Greenland, the "open Polar Sea," the connection
between the Greenland and American coasts, and other
points. Dr. Kane's theories are shown to have been based
on very insufficient data, and subsequent exploration has
only served to prove the justness of Dr. Rink's criticisms.
One of the most careful papers in this section is by
Admiral E. Irminger, of the Danish Navy, on "The
Arctic Current around Greenland." This paper is based
on a thorough examination of the log-books of a large
number of Danish ships sailing between Greenland and
Denmark. The now generally accepted conclusion he
reaches is that the current from the ocean around Spitz-
bergen, which carries so considerable masses of ice, after
it has passed along the east coast of Greenland, turns
westward and northward around Cape Farewell, without
detaching any branch to the south-westward, directly
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
towards the banks of Newfoundland. The current after-
wards runs northward along the S. W. coast of Greenland,
until about lat. 64° N., and at times even as far up as 67°.
Afterwards turning westwards, it unites with .the current
coming from Baffin's and Hudson's Bays, running to the
southward on the western side of Davis Strait, along the
coast of Labrador, thus increasing the enormous quantity
of ice that is poured into the Atlantic Ocean.
The concluding series of papersin the geographical
section is by Admiral Collinson. "The full results of
that distinguished officer's remarkable Arctic voyage," to
quote the words of the preface, "have never been given
to the public ; and both the Fellows of the Society and
the officers of the Arctic Expedition are to be congratu-
lated on having elicited so valuable an instalment.
Admiral Collinson gives his notes on the state of the ice,
and on indications of open water, from the mouth of the
Siberian river Kolyma, along the shores of Arctic
America, to Bellot Strait. He also furnishes a narrative
of all the expeditions that have explored the shores of
Arctic America, from Point Barrow to the Mackenzie

Mongols in all directions. The pressure caused by these
invading waves on the tribes of Northern Siberia drove
them still further to the north. Horde succeeding horde
increased the pressure, until at last the Omoki, the
Chelaki, the Onkilon, and other aboriginal tribes, were
driven quite out of the country, and have long ago dis-
appeared entirely, leaving only traditions of their existence
and remains here and there of their yourts or dwellings.
Mr. Markham thinks that here we have probably the
commencement of the exodus of the Greenland Esqui-
maux, which spread over a period of one or two centuries.
He believes they must have made their way from Cape
Chelagskoi to the Pairy group, probably over a chain of
islands. Still keeping northwards, by Banks Island,
Melville Island, Bathurst Island, North Somerset and
Devon, Jones' Sound, Carey Islands, on all which un-

which they crossed in parties during the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth centuries. Some established their hunting

grounds between the Humboldt and Melville Bay glaciers,
and became the ancestors of that very curious and inte-
resting race of men the Arctic Highlanders. Here the
vegetation, the constant open water, and other conditions
rendered a permanent settlement possible. Mr. Mark-
ham believes that some of these immigrants proceeded
southwards and peopled South Greenland; not only soj
but that parties also wandered still further north than the
Humboldt Glacier, and that it is not improbable that
our new Expedition may find groups of Esquimaux up
to the very Pole itself. Nous vcrrons. Meantime, we
repeat, Mr. Markham's theory seems to us a plausible
one, and to answer all the requirements of an immi-
gration into Greenland of a people such as are the Esqui-
maux. Dr. Rink, however, in a paper on the Descent of
the Esquimaux, is inclined to believe them the last wave
of an aboriginal American population driven from the
interior by the pressure of tribes behind them. This
may have been so, and the people in the north-east of
Siberia, so strongly resembling the Esquimaux in lan-
guage, physique, and customs, may have been American
emigrants ; but the reverse hypothesis appears to us much
more probable.
Another extremely interesting paper by Mr. Markham, on
the Arctic Highlanders, contains many details concerning

Sec., of this curious people. Mr. Markham remarks upon
what has been noticed by several explorers, the won-
derful talent of this people for topography, and repro-
duces a most careful and accurate chart of the Greenland
Coast from Cape York to Smith Channel, drawn by the
Greenlander Erasmus York These two papers are well
worthy the attention, not only of the explorers for whom
they have been compiled, but of all interested in Green-
land ethnography. Mr. Markham's other contributions
are a sketch of the grammar of the Esquimaux language,
with copious vocabularies, and a long list of the names of
all places on the coast of Greenland from lat. 65° 15' N.
on the eastern side, round Cape Farewell, to the entrance
of Smith Sound. Along with this most laborious list is
a chart of the south coast of Greenland from the Danish
Admiralty Survey, with Mr. R, H, Major's adaptation of
the ancient sites in the East Bygd, of the old Greenland
colony.

The following explanation of the reaction occurring
during the immersion of the collodionised plate in the
nitrate bath is given at p. 41 : "The salts of iodine and
of bromine that exist in the collodion film change their
properties with nitrate of silver and give birth to iodide
and bromide of silver and to nitric acid salts" The
italics are our own. On p. 70 a footnote is added to
explain that "I gramme = the i,oooth part of a cubic
metre, about nine solid feet of water at the ordinary
average temperature."
Under the head of "Operation of Light on the
Elements," which commences on p. 107, we find that
chlorine is "a greenish strong-smelling gas developed
from chloride of lime," that bromine "is an unpleasantly
smelling substance of a fluid nature," and that iodine is
"a black substance also of a fluid nature and used for
friction." "Sulphur unites with oxygen and produces
the pungent strong-smelling sulphuric acid ;" "chloride
and bromide gas show a peculiar relation to light even in
their combinations ;" and lastly, iodine again appears as
a "solid body appearing in the form of shining black

crystals, and emitting, when heated, a wonderful violet
vapour."
Under the head of "Chemical Effects '.'of Light on
Salts of Silver," chloride of silver forms a "cheesy" pre-
cipitate ; chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver are "very
tenacious bodies ;" when chloride of silver is exposed to
light, the "chloride is liberated, and disappears as a
greenish gas, which, from its abundance as well as its
odour, can be perceived to be chloride of silver." "Green
vitriol is greatly attracted by oxygen, and taking it up
readily, passes into sulphate of iron."
On p. 118 we have the following lucid description of the
toning process :—" The positive prints are subjected to a
further treatment styled the colouring process. To this
end it is plunged in a very diluted solution of gold. This
solute (sic) contains chloride of gold. Metal silver has
more affinity with chlorine than gold; hence it combines
with the chlorine, forming chloride of silver, while the
gold is precipitated. It becomes separated in the shape
of a blue colour, adhering to the outlines of the picture,
and this blue, mixed with the brown of the picture, gives
a pleasant tone which does not change in the fixing-bath,
that is, in hyposulphite of soda." The latter body is, by
the way, alluded to indifferently as hyposulphite of soda,
"fixing sodium," and " fixing natrium."

In photographic apparatus the translator is equally
at sea. A dark slide is continually spoken of as a
"cassette," and a printing frame as a "copper frame."
The technical names of the processes are also as a rule
incorrect.
We have no patience to devote more time to this
wretched translation, which is only passable in portions
of the part on the physics of some of the photographic
processes.
While Dr. Vogel is held to blame for a prolixity
and discursiveness which, together with the childishly
elementary character of much of the work, render it very
dull, the editors of the "International Scientific Series"
must be held responsible for still further reducing the
value of the work by employing a translator ignorant of

gestions for the improvement of this publication, and within
reasonable limits never allow either trouble or cost to prevent
the adoption of all which in any way commend themselves to

Your suggestion is as follows :—
"The publication of the monthly as well as the annual
amounts of rain for the whole of the 1,700 stations is very
desirable, and it is hoped that in an early issue of the 'British
Rainfall' it will be done."
I shall be glad if you will allow me to supplement the data
which were before you when the above paragraph was written
by some other facts, and to learn from your pages whether or
not this fuller information induces any modification of your
views.
As I (whether fortunately or unfortunately I need not say)
have to pay my own printers bills, I always keep them as low
as possible ; hence, the publication being, an annual one, state-
ments made in one volume are rarely repeated in the next.
Therefore, probably, your reviewer was not aware of the prin-
ciples upon which the tables of monthly rainfall (pp. 140-145)

are compiled, viz., to give one station in every county in the
British Isles, and two in a few of the larger ones, such as York,
Inverness, and Ross. I may add en passant that these tables
give the monthly fall at 108 stations, while the Registrar-
General of England is satisfied with forty-four, and of Scotland
with fifty-five; so that my table exceeds both together. That,
however, is of little moment. [t?or your own information, I
enclose a map with these 108 stations plotted.]
In the next place, I must refer to "British Rainfall, 1871,"
I p. 135-138, where the question of publishing additional monthly
returns is discussed at length, and the method of computing the
monthly fall from the percentage tables (which are given every
year) is explained and illustrated by a completely worked-out
example.
To this let me add that returns from 150 other stations are
published monthly in my Meteorological Magazine, and that up
to the present time another very large series (143) has been
printed biennially in the Reports of the British Association.
If it is the opinion of yourself and of others competent to judge
that still more is necessary, more shall be done; but it must be
borne in mind that the accurate (and without accuracy figures are
worse than useless) printing of 20,400 values involves a great
expenditure both of time and of money. I do not quite know
whence either the one or the other is to be obtained.

[It was just because of the inadequacy of one station in each
county of the British Isles, and two in the larger counties, to
represent the rainfall, even though these be supplemented by
Mr. Glaisher's forty-four stations, the Scottish Meteorological
Society's two hundred odd, and by Mr. Symons himself in his
Magazine and in the British Association Reports, that we stated
it to be very desirable that the monthly as well as the annual
amounts of rain for the whole of the 1,700 stations were pub-
lished. The method of computing the monthly tall from the
percentage tables referred to in "British Rainfall, 1871," pp.
135-138, does not supply what is desiderated. It Is the capri-
ciousness of the distribution of the rainfall and its important
bearings on many practical questions which render so desirable
a knowledge of the actual monthly amounts in particular locali-
ties. Since what is desired would be an invaluable contribution
to British Meteorology, we earnestly hope that Mr. Symons
will be induced to supply it, and that in that case he will receive
substantial support in carrying on a work so important.]

MR. FORDHAM (NATURE, vol. xii. p. 87) is quite right in
conjecturing that it may be without foundation he has thought
that primroses are not found in districts in which cowslips are
common, and lift rend. In the north-east of Staffordshire, for
miles round Denstone College, early in Ihe spring, nearly all
the hedges and many of the fields are covered with primroses.
Later on cowslips abound ; I might add that oxlips are also far
from being rare.
I have watched closely, but have never found a trace ot any
destruction of the flower by biids. This, perhaps, may be
accounted for by the fact that this being a pasture country, the
sparrow, finding no grain, is a rara avis about heie. 1 have
noticed in Lord Bagot's wood, seme twelve miles from here,
where sparrows as well as many other birds are found in great
numbers, that the primroses nearly always present a very ragged
appearance. D- EDWABDKS

I COULD name half a dozen spots to the north of London
(Mill Hill) where cowslips and primroses have abounded to-
gether in the same meadow, to my own knowledge, for the past
twenty years. For at least five years I con say that neither the
primroses nor cowslips were attacked by birds, though the

Airy consists mainly of the usual statements under the
various heads of the state of the buildings and instruments,
the constitution of the staff, and the amount of work done.
In all these respects the Observatory seems to be in a
satisfactory condition. One important change in the
Btaff during the past year has been the resignation of
Mr. Glaisher, who has for so many years been connected
with the Observatory, and which has rendered necessary
a readjustment of the duties of the various observers.

he takes a rapid glance over the changes in the Obser-
vatory in the forty years during which he has been at
its head. "The Observatory was expressly built," he
states, "for the aid of astronomy and navigation, for pro-
moting methods of determining longitude at sea, and (as
the circumstances that led to its foundation show) more
especially for determination of the moon's motions. All
these imply, as their first step, the formation of accurate
catalogues of stars, and the determination of the funda-
mental elements of the solar system. These objects have
been steadily pursued from the foundation of the Obser-
vatory; in one way, by Flamsteed; in another way, by
Halley, and by Bradley in the earlier part of his career;
in a third form, by Bradley in his later years, by Mas-
kelyne (who contributed most powerfully both to lunar
and to chronometric nautical astronomy), and for a time
by Pond; then with improved instruments by Pond, and
by myself for some years; and, subsequently, with the
instruments now in use. It has been invariably my own
intention to maintain the principles of the long-established
system in perfect integrity; varying the instruments, the

modes of employing them, and the modes of utilising the
observations by calculation and publication, as the pro-
gress of science might seem to require.
"While instruments of the same class, but of increased
power, have been substituted for those which I found
here, three novel constructions have been introduced;
the lunar altazimuth, the reflex-zenith-tube, and the
chronograph; and, for a special investigation, the water-
telescope (now dismounted). I omit mention of auxiliary
instruments. To utilise the observations, the numerical
reductions for each current year have always been main-
tained in the most perfect state that I could devise.
From these, elaborate star-catalogues (now in frequent
demand) have been formed from time to time. And, for
connecting the observations of the moveable bodies of
our system in a complete and homogeneous series,
beginning at 1750, first the planetary observations,
and secondly the lunar observations of my prede-
cessors have been reduced, and orbital elements have
been corrected. The lunar reductions are probably
the greatest single work ever undertaken in astronomy.
This portion of our labours may be considered as
applying to the combined subjects of astronomy and
navigation. But there are also, peculiar to astronomy,
the photoheliography and spectroscopy lately intro-

duced. And, peculiar to navigation and related subjects,
there are the investigation of the laws of magnetic dis-
turbance in iron ships, and the correction of the compass
by methods now used in the commercial navies through
the world; the maintenance of magnetic observations;
the incessant attention to chronometers; the extensive
dissemination of accurate time-signals; and the daily
dropping of a time-ball at Deal.
"The subject of meteorology, which has been followed
for many years, is scarcely connected with the two great
heads of astronomy and navigation, and hardly deserves
the name of a science. It is, however, in great popular
request. Mechanical self-registration of some meteoro-
logical phenomena was introduced by me shortly after
the commencement of my residence. Since that time
the practical arts of photography and galvanic com-
munication were invented, and they were quickly made
available in many of our operations. In this increase
of occupations, the annual expenses of the Observatory
have increased, but in a much lower proportion than the
work done.

THE PROGRESS OF THE TELEGRAPH *
VII.
IN 1843 Alexander Bain made certain important improve-
ments in the recording and transmitting instrument
shown in Fig. 28, in which two semicircular magnets B B',
with similar poles facing, fixed to a brass bar, move through
the centres of two coils, A A', the index-hand pointing
to I or V according to the direction of the current. This
was controlled by the metallic contacts N N' N" N'" open-
ing or closing the battery and line circuits according to
the position of the handle F. The connection and direc-
tion of the current through the instrument from the bat-
tery D is indicated by the arrows, the connection R being
that of the line wire, and s that of the earth circuit.
This patent and certain others that will be brought
under notice gave rise to expensive litigation in the
early history of the telegraph. In 1846 John Nott
produced his letter-recording telegraph, which, in con-
junction with Mr. Alexander Bain's inventions, was
carried into the law courts on a question of infringement
of the Cooke and Wheatstone patent rights; but for

reasons already given regarding patent law, the oppo-
sition was unsuccessful on the part of the Electric Tele-
graph Company.
FIG. 28.—Bain's I and V telegraph, 1843.
Nott's apparatus is shown in external and internal eleva-
tion in Figs. 29 and 30. It consisted of a dial showing
the letters of the alphabet and numerals repeated four
times in the circumference of the circle. The respective
letters or numerals were indicated by the step-by-step
motion of a revolving pointer or index-hand. The motion
of this pointer was controlled by successive make-and-
break contacts with the battery by means of a finger-key
dipping into a mercury cell, b. The index-pointer was
driven round by a " clawker-and-driver" action in con-
nection with the toothed wheel c, the propelling power
being derived from the attractive and repellant action of
two horseshoe electro-magnets, a, if, acting upon soft iron
armatures in connection with the "clawker-and-driver" j
motion. The electro-magnet b governed the alarum or

In 1846 Highton's gold leaf indicator was brought under
notice, and an important automatic chemical printer-

has been the germ of several of the applications in the
modern high-speed automatic arrangements (Fig. 25). In

ribbon. As the ribbon was drawn forward whenever a
perforation passed the point of the style, metallic contact
between the battery and line wire was momentarily made,
and a current transmitted to the distant station, the dura-
tion of the current being regulated by the length of the
perforation in the paper—thus giving the dot and dash
code. The message at the distant station was printed by
chemical decomposition. A ribbon of paper, prepared by
immersion in a solution of sulphuric acid and prussiate of
potass, was drawn over a metal cylinder in communica-
tion with the earth, and pressing upon this chemically
prepared paper was a metal style in connection with the
line wire. When, therefore, a current is received by reason
of the metal style at the

London at that time, arising from the Chartist demonstra-
tion and supposed possible attempt upon the Bank of
England, by no means allayed the disquietude of the
directors ; as it was, most of the electrical staff had been
sworn special constables, and truncheon in hand had
assisted in guarding the principal buildings in the vicinity
of the Bank of England and Royal Exchange. What if
on the opening day a mob should rush in intent upon

sovereigns and indifferent gold were in free circula-

his place of trust to weigh a suspicious-looking piece of
gold in scales situated on the opposite side of the great

Liverpool and Manchester were 8s. 6/f. under twenty

costly staff of clerks, the original outlay, wear and tear,

after the manner of the stage manager behind the curtain
who surveys the patronage bestowed upon the boxes,
stalls, and dress circle from his mysterious peephole, so

of England porter, performing his prescribed beat against
the Bank wall. The sun marked midday,—afternoon,

Empty tills, idle clerks, disappointed directors. Such was

* * mammals are so well known to everyone as the
Elephant, few are more interesting from their sagacity
and usefulness to mankind, and few are so wholly
separated and isolated from all other forms which now
exist. Formerly the Elephants were grouped with the
Rhinoceroses or with the Pigs, but a better knowledge of
their structure has shown that they form an entirely
distinct order, to which the name Proboscidea has been
given, on account of the trunk, or proboscis, which is

one of their most striking features. Two well-marked
species of Elephant exist, the Indian {Elephas indicus)
and the African (E. africanus).
The former is found in a wild state throughout the
forest-lands of the greater part of India, Ceylon, Burmah,
Siam, Cochin-China, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra,
except where it has been driven back by the advance of
civilisation; whether it is indigenous to any of the other
islands of the Eastern Archipelago is doubtful. The
Elephant of Sumatra and Ceylon has been separated by
Schlegel as a distinct species, E. sumatranus, .but Dr.
Falconer and others have shown that their differences,
though appreciable, do not amount to specific characters.
The Indian Elephant has been domesticated from the
earliest ages—in India before historic times, and also by
the ancient Persians. It has been used in war, in
carriage, and in state pageants, and is still much em-
ployed in road-making and bridge-building, where its
strength, its sagacity, and its adroitness in piling logs,
lifting weights, and similar operations, render its services
invaluable.
The second species inhabits Africa, south of the Sahara,
from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, and formerly
extended its range to the Cape of Good Hope. In
ancient times it was domesticated by the Carthaginians,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and was the species generally imported by the Romans,
but no succeeding African race has had the sagacity to
make use of it. It is killed in vast numbers for the sake
of its ivory, of which an enormous quantity is annually
brought to Europe; and in so wasteful a fashion is this
slaughter carried on, that the species will probably soon
be exterminated. Although so well known to the ancients,
it is only quite recently that live African elephants have
been brought to Europe in modern times. There was
one in Antwerp in 1863, and two years later a pair were
obtained by the Zoological Society, which are still alive
and well, the male having attained a height of ten feet.
Since this, numbers of these animals have been imported
down the Nile from the Soudan, and they are now com-
mon in menageries.
In size there is not much difference between the two
species, and the maximum height would appear to be
about eleven feet; an Indian elephant shot by Sir Victor
Brooke reached that stature, which was not exceeded by
the tallest of eleven hundred individuals measured by
Dr. Falconer. In external appearance the two species

IT is not only due to the quantitative increase of
scientific work, but also to the exigencies of the
division of labour, that the German serials dedicated
to zoological and anatomical research have been aug-
mented by two new ones this year.
The Morpholo^isches Jahrbuck, edited by Carl Gegen-

history of the development of animals in their mutual
and intimate relation as animal morphology. It has for
its first object the recognition of the intimate relations
amongst different degrees of animal organisation, and
further, to consider the anatomy of man as illustrated by
the knowledge of the construction of lower organisms.
This programme evidently excludes all descriptions and
one-sided observations which cannot be used for the
above purpose. The first number contains papers on
the extreme ends of the animal world, viz., Man and
Infusoria, and thus illustrates the end in view most
perfectly. The Jahrbuch will be supplemented annually
by a yearly report of the progress of the anatomy of

("Journal of Anatomy and History of Development"),
edited by \V. His and W. Brauce, Professors of Ana-

object of this new serial is to be the knowledge of the
human body; but papers will also be received which
touch upon this theme from a somewhat more distant
point of view. At the same time attention will also
be turned to the practical side of this subject as well as
the theoretical, and materials will be offered to the
medical man which will be of immediate use to him in
his sphere of action. The double number published of
this serial shows that its programme has very wide
limits and will eventually be of interest to the zoologist
and anatomist, as well as to the practical physician.
A number of this serial will be published every two

A STRANGE case of poisoning is reported from Stettin. A
gentleman had bought a hat in a shop there, and, after having
worn it for one or two days, was troubled with unbearable head-
ache; at the same time little ulcers formed upon his forehead,
his eyes were inflamed, and the whole of the upper part of his

head was much swollen. It was evident that these symptoms were
caused by the hat, and upon examination by a chemist it was
found that the brown leather in the inside of the hat was
coloured with a poisonous aniline dye. It appears that inflam-
mation is unavoidable when this dye is in contact with any part
of the skin.

THE great meeting of German ornithologists took place at
Brunswick on May 20-23. Bream, Cabanis, Homeyer, Blasius,
Reichenow, Pralle, and many other members of the two ornitho-

union of the two societies. It was resolved to request all the
members to report to a Committee from time to time all obser-
vations of interest to science, agriculture, or the economy of
forests, that they may make, on the life, manners, use, &c., of
German birds. The Committee is to publish the materials thus

IN a letter dated Constantinople, May 20, the Kiilnische

a severe shock was felt at Smyrna which lasted several seconds.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Two other shocks followed the same morning, and although
many houses were shaken, yet none fell. It is thought that the
centre of the earthquake was in the Sporades Islands. Accord-
ing to other reports on the dreadful earthquake of the 3rd~5th of
May in the interior, the sources of the Moeander river were indi-
cated as the centre of the volcanic action. This point is situated
in the canton of Ishikli, to the south of Ushak and Afiutn Kara-
hissar. The destruction was fearful at Ishikli: about 1,000
houses were completely destroyed and several thousand people
killed ; only about twenty dwelling-houses and two mosques are
now standing. In the village of Yivril not one of 300 houses is
left, and about 450 dead have been extricated from the ruins.
Not far from there an immense chasm has formed in the ground,
from which is running a stream of hot water. The village of
Yaka is likewise annihilated. In other villages, as Savasli,
Karayapli, &c., the inhabitants escaped with a violent shock.

of two storms, one of which was violent at Vienna on January 27,
1874, and the other a tropical hurricane which passed over the
island of St. Thomas on August 21, 1871. In the first case
a/>, expressed in millimetres per 50 miles, amounts to 3"I25, of
which 2 7 is due to the rotation of the earth, and -4 to centrifugal
force. In the second, the earth's rotation causes a difference of
1 "25, and centrifugal force of 8'87, the whole A B being io-I2.
A difference of pressure amounting to 9 "02 at a distance from the
centre of 57 miles, is caused in this case by a velocity of 30 metres
per second. Thus, in storms of small diameter, the effect of
centrifugal force greatly exceeds, and in our cyclones falls tar
short of, that of the rotation of the earth. If the air streams
towards or (in lofty regions) from the centre, another factor
must be introduced into equation (I.) representing resistance to

tion of the extent to which dependence may be placed on the
discrimination of monoclinic and triclinic felspars by the methods
usually recognised in ordinary microscopic research. Some other

which might be produced on polarised light by the overlap of
twin lamellce in thin sections of felspars, when cut obliquely to
the planes of twinning, were also considered. The paper termi-
nated with a list of conclusions deduced from the observations
recorded. Theie conclusions mostly related to matters of detail;

determination of doubtful examples, and that such examples are
of more frequent occurrence than one would at first be led to
suspect.—On the Lias about Rads'.ock, by Mr. Ralph Tate,
A.L.S. In this paper the author described several sections in
the Lias of the neighbourhood of Radstock, in Somersetshire,
with special reference to their palaiontological contents and to
the question of the division of the Lias into zones in accord-
ance with the species of Ammonites occurring in different parts
of the series. He maintained that although the Lower Lias in
this district only attains a thickness of twenty-four feet, this is
due to poverty of sediment; and that whilst by this means the
zones are compressed, and the species of Ammonites brought
almost into juxtaposition, the succession of Ammonite-life is as
regular in the Radstock Lias as in the most tjpical districts.
Much of the opposition to the doctrine of zoological zones he
ascribed to erroneous discrimination of species. The paper
included tables of sections and lists of fossils, with the argu-
ments founded upon them, in support of the above opinion. A

CROLL'S "CLIMATE AND TIME"
Climate and Time in their Geological Relations; a tfieory
of Secular Changes of the EartKs Climate. By James
Croll, of H.M. Geological Survey of Scotland. (London:
Daldy, Isbister, and Co., 1875.)
MR. CROLL is well known as an original thinker of
considerable power, who has turned his attention
to the physics of geology, and has produced a series of
remarkable papers on questions of the highest interest in
that subject. His views are opposed in many respects to
those accepted by other influential thinkers, and have given
rise to a considerable amount of controversy. Hitherto
they have been scattered in papers to various periodicals,
and it has been difficult to obtain a consecutive view of
them. The work which is now issued, while not an
actual reprint of previous papers, is a complete exposi-
tion of their contents, or at least of that part of their
contents that Mr. Croll is prepared to stand by, some of
the arguments that occur in his papers being omitted in
his book. We are now therefore able to judge fairly what
truth there is in Mr. Croll's ideas, and to compare them
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
with those of his opponents. Even were all his ideas un-
tenable, we should still have to thank him for his
vigorous discussion of these interesting questions, but
there can be no doubt that in many instances he proves
his point.
Mr. Croll does not possess the happy faculty which
some authors have of carrying his readers with him: on
the contrary, his style is so controversial, that to agree
with him is to have the feeling of being vanquished,
and the reader is throughout set on his metal to find
out some flaw in the argument. This, as in most cases
of controversy, it would not be difficult to do; but we
must confine ourselves to the discussion of his main
results.
One peculiarity of Mr. Croll's arguments must here be
noticed. After having assumed certain figures and
arrived by their means at definite results, he proceeds to
show that these figures are unreliable, and then to state
that their unreliableness will not affect his results; or else,
in order to bring his results more into accordance with
received opinions and probable facts, he generously halves
them or diminishes them still more, apparently unaware
that had his arguments been correct and his first results
the true ones, he would have proved too much and
refuted himself. Examples of this peculiarity will be
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
seen in the sequel.
The first question discussed is the heating influence of
the Gulf Stream. To estimate this Mr. Croll uses the
method of heat units, and prides himself on doing so.
The method is an undeniable one, and is perhaps the
only one by which the influence of the high specific heat
of water can be made manifest. Mr. Croll compares the
number of foot-pounds conveyed by the Gulf Stream into
temperate regions with the number due to the heat of the
sun shining directly on those regions. The relative value
of these depends on the absolute value of each. The
volume, velocity, and temperature of the Gulf Stream
have been very variously estimated; and as to the sun's

heat, when we remember how much the diathermancy of
the air depends on its condition, we may not be able to
accept with such confidence as Mr. Croll, the estimates
of Pouillet ; yet with every possible allowance, when the
influence of a vast body of heated water is calculated, it
will undoubtedly be much greater than would have been
previously supposed, and actually amounts to a very con-

totally unreliable. We do not know the temperature
from which the sun raises the earth, except that it is
greater than that of space. The fourth argument, of
course, is nothing without the first three, and the frac-
tion \ we have seen may be much too large. We are not,
then, in a position to estimate accurately the thermal
effect of the Gulf Stream and other ocean currents ; but
we may consider it proved, as is indeed generally
acknowledged, that they have a very sensible influence,
and, as we shall see, bear a great part in the general cir-
culation of the ocean water.
We musf now examine how far Mr. Croll establishes
his position that a general oceanic circulation is im-
possible under the influence of temperature and gravita-
tion alone. Dr. Carpenter has already given (Proc. of
Roy. Geog. Soc., vol. xviii.) his reasons for his beli ef in
the adequacy of these influences, and his replies to Mr.
Croll's objections, some of which are discussed in this
volume in no less than four chapters. Although it may
be familiar to most of our readers, it will be well to give
here an outline of Dr. Carpenter's "doctrine."

The chilling of the salt water in both polar regions
renders it heavier and causes it to sink, its place being
supplied from the warmer water of lower latitu des, which
is itself supplied by the motion of the water from the two
poles towards the equator along the lower portion of the
ocean ; and these two masses meeting each other near
the equator, well up there, and bring the colder water
nearer the surface, while the heating of the surface water
in these regions keeps up the difference between the
specific gravities of the water supplied to and leaving the
polar regions, on which the whole depends. These
appear to be Dr. Carpenter's latest views (Proc. Roy-
Geog. Soc., vol. xviii., June 1874), though Mr. Croll's
objections seem, in some part at least, to be aimed at
details that do not affect the fundamental conception.
This is distinguished as a vertical circulation, because
the first origination of the motion is supposed to be in
the descent of the polar waters. Mr. Croll assents to the
facts, but ascribes the circulation to the initiation of the
winds, and denies that there is any circulation beyond
that produced by currents. We know that currents exist
on the surface, and it is generally agreed that they owe
their origin, in great part at least, to the system of prevailing
winds, and even on Dr. Carpenter's theory they must, so
far as they tend polewards, decrease by so much the

general circulation of the upper ocean; but the known
or assumed under-currents are much more local, and the
depression of temperature at great depths is too general
to allow us to conceive that the return should be made by
circumscribed currents.
In discussing the question whether the polar cold is
sufficient to cause circulation, Mr. Croll first objects that
the sea of the tropics is salter, and therefore denser, than
that of the poles, and that this would counteract the
effect of the cold. There is in reality but little force in
this objection as against Dr. Carpenter's theory. The
excess of temperature and of salinity counteract each
other in the surface layers of the tropics, and prevent
them sinking or rising; but as they have a nearly hori-
zontal motion, according to the theory, the objection is

vertical motion deriving it from a vis-a-tergo / and with
regard to the polar area the ;lower layers cannot be more
salt than the upper, from whence they come, according
to the theory, and any freezing on the surface must leave
the remaining water on the contrary salter.

water in motion. This Mr. Croll shows to depend entirely
and only on the amount of slope of the water-surface
from the equator to the pole, and not at all upon the
amount of fall from the surface in the polar regions, to
the lowest depth at which the water of maximum density
s found beneath the equator. Dr. Carpenter says that
this "would seem irreconcilable with the simplest prin-
ciples of physics," a statement easier to make than to
prove. For, as Mr. Croll shows plainly, the work done by
gravity in the descent, is done against gravity in the ascent
at the equator, and the two counteract each other, except
only the extra amount of gravity which is called into action
by the shrinkage of the polar column from what would
have been its size under the average amount of solar heat,
and which alone can have any continuous effect. The solar
heat is a constantly supplied moving force which is used
indirectly in the ocean circulation, and any further amount
of gravity made use of in the circuit would involve the
idea of perpetual motion. Connected with this is Dr.
Carpenter's assertion that there is no difference of level
between the equatorial and polar seas. Since, how-

ever, this is the only proximate cause for the ocean circu-
lation, its denial would seem to cut the ground from
beneath his feet. It will be found, however, that though
he denies it in one place he asserts it in another, and his
theory essentially depends on it. It is true that water
tends to find its level when disturbed, as it is by the
action of polar cold, which tends to alter its level; but it is
just this tendency that causes the circulation. If one of the
forces were to be powerful enough to have its own way
entirely, no motion could occur; i.e. if the water were too
viscous, a greater permanent change of level would arise;
if it were perfectly fluid, the equilibrium would be brought
about instantaneously and no visible motion would be
perceived. We must be content, then, with the fall of
level from equator to pole to produce the circulation : is
it sufficient? This depends entirely on the viscosity of
water. Mr. Croll bases his argument on the experiments
of Dubuat, who showed that water would not descend a
slope of 1 in 1,000,000, which is much greater than the
slope under discussion, and hence the fall of level is
too small to cause any circulation. He replies to Dr.
Carpenter's objection, that these experiments had refer-
ence to water running over solids and not over itself, by
saying that one layer of molecules alone would be in con-
tact with the solid and the rest with the water surface

only. The reply is plainly beside the mark, as Mr. Croll
should have seen by reading Dr. Carpenter's statement
following his objection, that the difference between a fluid
restoring its own equilibrium, and having a sensible
motion over solid surfaces, was well known in practice to
Mr. Hawksley and other hydraulic engineers. But in
reality no chamber experiments can determine such a
point satisfactorily; and besides this, it seems to us that
an important point has been overlooked by Mr. Croll.
No doubt it would be hard for a single pound of water to
perform its whole circuit against all opposing frictions
under the impulse of the force due to so small an amount
of slope; but if large masses of water move together, the
moving force would be proportional to the mass, but the
friction to be overcome would be simply that of the peri-
meter of the tube of flow, and it is an essential part of the
theory of ocean circulation that the moving water is of
immense mass. This friction would not increase, like
statical friction, with the mass, since the pressure would
be the same at the same depths, and it is also more of
the nature of shearing force than friction, and therefore

proportion as we proceed from the centre they are turned
outwards, being deflected to the right of the surface
winds; in other words, they tend more and more to blow
out from the area of low pressure. On the other hand,
they converge upon the centre of the regions of high
pressure, cutting the isobars nearly at right angles. This
last point is interesting in connection with the circum-
stance pointed out some time ago by Hoffmeyer, that
surface winds in blowing out of the areas of high pres-
sure cut the isobars approximately at right angles. Charts

which Sweden lies between two storms, the one following
the other with only a short interval between them. In
these cases the behaviour of the upper currents from both
storms and the manner in which they blend together at
their contiguous margins are very instructive.
The winds on the surface of the earth, as compared
with the upper currents, show, as is well known, inverse
relations to areas of low and high pressure—blowing
inwards upon areas of low pressure, and outwards from
areas of high pressure. Consequently, as the author

remarks, an area of low barometer is necessarily the
region of an ascending current, which, when it has risen
to a great height in the atmosphere, flows away from the
central space of low pressure towards regions of high
pressure, whence it sinks gradually down to the surface as
a descending current, and in this manner a vertical circu-
lation is constantly maintained between the surface of the
earth and the higher limits of the atmosphere. We very
strongly recommend that, as has been so successfully
carried out in Sweden, a thorough and systematic
observation of the cirrus cloud be generally inaugurated
in other countries, so that it may be possible to chart the
upper currents over a wide extent. Among the many
points suggested by M. Hildebrandsson's charts is the
question whether the extent and volume of the upper
currents flowing outwards from storm areas be consistent
with some of the views recently advanced on the theory
of storms and circulation of the atmosphere. We hope
meteorologists will soon take steps to occupy the impor-
tant field of observation now opened up.

been made a subject of not less careful study and reflection than
the system itself." But afier a patient analysis and comparison
of its several forms, he comes to the conclusion that it is insuffi-
cient to account for the facts.
Thus, as it seems to me, he clearly repudiates the theory of
spontaneous growth.
Mr. Morgan thinks that his solution of the problem of rela-
tionships must have escaped my notice, because I did not discuss
it in my paper read before the Anthropological Institute; but in
that memoir I quoted from the chapter in question, and went on
to say—
"Mr. Morgan admits that systems of relationships have
undergone a gradual development, following that of the social
condition; but he also attributes to them great value in the
determination of ethnological affinities. I am not sure that I
exactly understand his views as to the precise bearing of these
two conclusions in relation to one another ; and I have else-
where given my reasons for dissenting from his interpretation of
the facts in reference to social relations."
Thus I expressly pointed out that Mr. Morgan, while charac-

terising the "classificatory " sys'em, to use hU own terms, as
"arbitrary and artificial," nevertheless also regards it as having
"undergone a gradual development following that of the social
condition." Surely Mr. Morgan must have written his letter
without having my book by him, for it seems to me that the
above passages, taken together, represent his own theory, as
given in his letter. Mr. Morgan hints that the conclusions con-
tained in his last chapter had escaped my notice. He appears
to have overlooked the fact that I quoted from that very chapter.
I was not, however, reviewing his work, and differing funda-
mentally, as I do, from the conclusions adopted by him, while
feeling deeply also the great obligations to him under which
ethnologists lie, I preferred to state my own views rather than
to dwell on the differences between the conclusions at which he

hasty to tell me that he explained it all so suddenly with perfect
certainty, and that I am unable to comprehend him. It is also
scarcely wise to lead us to infer that probably he cannot explain
the whole, but that he knows somebody who will soon do it.
Prof. Reynolds seems to base his calculations on some of my
experiments which dealt with a perceptible amount of gas. and
has not taken notice of those where there is no amount of gas
known to be present ; for example, in a chemical vacuum.
Prof. Reynolds must show that there is gas or vapour re-
maining, and he must also show that there is enough to produce
the mechanical results. lie tells us that the forces will increase
as the density of the gases diminishes. The speed will, but if
the force does, that can only be up to a certain point, when it is
equally certain that a change will take place, and the motion of
the particles or molecules will be attended with less force accor-
ding as they diminish in number. The opposite to this involves
something not intended. I suppose he dues not intend to speak
of forces without matter. The analogy with sound is not quite
happy, as that is so readily diminished by lower pressure; al-

usual way by means of Nicol's prisms of glass plates or other
appropriate polariscope. The beautiful chromatic phenomena
thus brought out at once indicate that amongst the causes which
operate to produce the hardness of glass, powerful compression
of the interior by the contracting exterior must be one. The
phenomena are, in fact, essentially those of compressed glass,
and the curves of colour, or black and yellow, seen when the
glass is examined by white or monochromatic light, indicate suc-
cessive curves of tension and balanced or no-tension. In a care-
fully prepared glass rod of half-inch length these curves are
rings traversed by a well-marked black cross. In an oval the
rings assume the character of those seen in braxial crystals.
When plates are examined, the light being transmitted from
back toiront, they appear to act essentially as bi-refracting plates
with crosses and bands somewhat irregularly distributed, but
capable of being referred to the angles of the places or to centres
of unequal heating.
My experiments on the mechanical properties of the glass have
chiefly been confined to testing its hardness and the possibility of
grinding it. So far as I have gone at present I make it to be
nearly twice as hard as ordinary glass, which it scratches with

fracturing, if great care be taken and the glass be well prepared.

no limit beyond which both surfaces may not be simultaneously
removed. This result, foretold by me from polariscopical analysis,
Mr. Fairley has kindly shown by dissolving the opposing surfaces
away by hydrofluoric acid. The least hard portions dissolved
much more readily than the thoroughly hardened, and the etched
surfaces show wavy lines closely following the tension lines
shown by the polariscope. There is further this remarkable
feature, that the inner portion of the glass proves to be essentially
common glass, which fractures in the ordinary way. Further
experiments are necessary for the complete elucidation of the
subject, and are in progress, but the preceding may be useful to
fellow-workers on the subject.

SCIENCE IN GERMANY
(From German Correspondents?)'.
HERR VON BEZOLD, of Munich, has published
some interesting researches on the periodical
changes in the frequency of thunderstorms during long
periods of time. These researches are particularly note-
worthy for the original manner in which the author has used
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the statistical materials on thunderstorms which he could
obtain (principally within the kingdom of Bavaria). As
the character of our reports will not permit us to give
details with regard to the manner of treatment, we pass
at once to the results which Herr von Bezold has
arrived at.
First of all it was found that the frequency of thunder-
storms during a long period is generally either on a con-
tinuous increase or decrease, and that these variations are
periodical.
If we ask on which other meteorological phenomena
these variations could possibly depend, the first thing to
be considered is the temperature. It is further advisable,
on account of the numerous relations that have lately
been discovered to exist between sunspots and meteoro-
logical phenomena, to turn attention also in this direc-
tion. It has been found in reality, that if we represent the
variations of the frequency of thunderstorms by a curve
and compare the same with the curve of the frequency
of sunspots, the minima of the thunderstorm curve
coincide exactly with the maxima in the sunspot curve.

of in the ordinary winter temperature. Most of the
nymphas passed the winter even in hothouses or in
heated rooms, and produced V. levana in the spring.
Similar researches were made by Weismann with another
common day-butterfly species, Pitris napi.
Weismann thinks that the winter form of these butter-
flies was the original one, which existed alone and in a
single annual generation in Europe, during the so-called
ice period. As the summers became longer and warmer,
a second and finally a third annual generation could be
produced, and these were changed to the Prorsa form by
the higher temperature. The return of the colder season
then always caused a return to the original form
(Atavism"), just as it occurred in the experiments. To
confirm this view, Weismann quotes the fact that in Lap-
land and in the upper Alps only a winter form of P. napi
exists. As with an incomplete return to the original form
intermediate forms result, the varying aspects of which
prove that the change of the original form always takes
place in a certain direction, Weismann thinks that the
change of temperature might certainly have given the

impulse for a change of form, but that the particular
direction of the same lies in the constitution of the animal in
question. We may certainly consider as a result of these
investigations, that a change of climate, together with
other causes, may have directly produced a great number
of different species of butterflies.
Another fact mentioned by Weismann refers to the
alove, and is no less interesting. There is one of the
lower Crustacea?, Leplodora hyalitui (Siebold's and K61-
liker's Zeilschrijt f&r Wisscnschaftliche Zoalcgie, 1875),
which is remarkable in many ways. This animal, ac-
cording to the observations of the Norwegian Sars, shows
similar phenomena, as the winter breed is differently
developed from the summer breed, although the perfect
forms are not so widely different as those of the butter-
flies.
ZOOLOGICAL NONSENSE
NOT many months since a controversy which had
been raging for several weeks in the columns of the
so-called "leading journal" was suddenly and completely
put an end to by a well-known writer in a contemporary

putants had been uttering what was absolute nonsense.
"1 use the word nonsense," he went on to say, "not as it
is often used as a vague term of disapproval, but with a

strict specific meaning, as contradistinguished from sense.
All words—all articulate words—must be either sense or
nonsense. They are sense if their meaning can be ima-
gined, conceived, represented in some way or other to the
mind. They are nonsense if their meaning cannot be
imagined, conceived, or represented in any way to the
mind. When a man says, ' I saw six men and two women
walking down such a street, dressed in such a way, and
heard them talking on such a subject," anyone can under-
stand, whether he believes it or not. The speaker is
talking sense, whether truly or falsely. If he were to say
he saw two crooked straight lines standing in the five
corners of a square, you would say he was talking non-
sense, that his words were neither true nor false, and that
he might as well keep silence, or utter any other unmeaning
sounds. The difference between these two examples
consists solely in this, that the first assertion can, whereas
the last cannot, be pictured to the mind. Each particular
word by itself is as clear in the one case as in the other."
What the question then under discussion was, does not

could find the truth they were earnestly seeking.
Those who desire to believe nonsense at all hazards
and in the face of the clearest possible proofs, and indeed
like it rather the better because it is so, can of course
continue in their fool's paradise. Who can doubt that
they see the paragon of animals in the author of the pas-
sage we have been criticising, and that he sits at the
centre—the "focal point" is the choice expression, we be-
lieve—of a select circle of admiring "pectoral sucklers"
the very " hub of the universe," as our American friends
might say? The Report of the last Local Examination
Syndicate of one of our Universities speaks of Zoology as
follows :— " The general character of the work in this sub-
ject is, perhaps, even worse than it was last year. In
many cases the teaching appears to have been faulty or
defective; there was a general ignorance of the principles
of zoological classification \ and a great number of candi-
dates sent up answers so full of confusion and error as to
lead to the opinion that they had only prepared for the

"ignorance of the principles of classification" when a
zoologist in a position to give instruction to youth and
encourage their devotion to the study of nature utters
absurdities such as we have just been noticing? We
fear that he is not alone in his mischievous folly.
LECTURES AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS*

June 10.—Prof. Mii'art on Kangaroos.
A FTER pointing out the external and osteological
•**• characters of the Kangaroo, the lecturer pro-
ceeded to consider the question, What is a Kangaroo?
what its place in the scale of animated beings; as
also its relations to space and time? At birth the
Kangaroo is strangely different from what it ulti-
mately becomes. It is customary to speak of the
human infant as exceptionally helpless at birth and
after it, but it is at once capable of vigorous suck-
ing, and very early learns to seek the nipple. The
great Kangaroo, standing some six feet high, is at birth
scarcely more than an inch long. Born in such a feeble
and imperfect condition, the young Kangaroo is not able
to suck of its own accord. The mother places it on one
of the nipples and squeezes its own milk-gland by means
of a muscle which covers it, in such a way that the fluid
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
enters the mouth of the young one. In most animals,
man included, the air-passage opens into the floor of the
mouth behind the tongue, and in front of the opening of
the gullet. Each particle of food as it goes towards the
gullet passes over the entrance to the windpipe, but is
prevented from falling in by the action of the epiglottis,
•which stands up in front of the opening and closes over
it when food is passing. But in the young Kangaroo, the
milk being introduced, not by any voluntary act of the
recipient, but by the action of the mother, it is evident
that some special mechanism is necessary to prevent
choking. This is found in the elongation of the upper
part of the windpipe, which projects up into the nasal
passage, and is embraced by the soft palate in such a
manner that the food passes on each side of it, whilst the
air does not enter the mouth at all.
The Kangaroo browses on the herbage and bushes of
more or less open country ; and, when feeding, commonly
applies its front limbs to the ground. It readily, how-
ever, raises itself on its hind limbs and strong tail, as on

because of its destructiveness to the sheep of the colonics.
It differs from all other members of the Kangaroo
order in that cartilages represent the marsupial bones
found in every other member of the order. The last family
consists of the true Opossums, which differ from all
above referred to in inhabiting America only, not Aus-
tralia. They are called Didelphidac; one species is
aquatic in habit, and web-footed.
Such are the verv varied forms composing the six
families which together make up the Kangaroo order.
What is its relation to those of the other Mammalia?
Very noticeable in it is the very great diversity of form,
dentition, and habit found in the order, some being
arboreal and vegetarian, others terrestrial and carni-

vorous, &c.; nevertheless, these so varied marsupial
forms possess in common important characters by
which they differ from all other mammals. These
characters, however, relate mainly to the structure
of their reproductive organs, as to the great importance
of which characters naturalists are agreed. The angle
of the lower jaw is also peculiar. Almost every
mammal which has marsupial bones has the angle of its
jaw inflected, or else has no angle at all, whilst every
animal which has both marsupial bones and an inflected
jaw-zngle, possesses also those other special characters
which distinguish the marsupials from all other mammals.
We have, therefore, at least two great groups, one non-
marsupial, containing man, the apes, bats, cats, hoofed
beasts, &c.—the Monodelphin ; the other containing the
marsupials only—the Didelphia. There is a third group
containing only the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna, which
form by themselves alone a third group, Ornithodelphia.
As to its zoological relations, we may therefore say that
the Kangaroo is a peculiarly modified form of a most
varied order of Mammalia (trie marsupials), which differs
from all ordinary beasts (and from man) by very impor-
tant anatomical and physiological characters, the sign of
the existence of which is the coexistence in it of mar-
supial bones with an inflected angle of the lower jaw. As

to the geographical relations of the Kangaroo, a study of
their distribution over the world shows that the Kangaroo
is one of an order of animals confined to the Australian
region and America, the great bulk of the order, in-
cluding all the Macropodida?, being strictly confined to
the Australian region.
The lecturer concluded by explaining the geological
relations of the Kangaroo and its order, pointing out that
in Australia we have an instance of zoological " survival"
connecting the existing creation with the triassic period.

N 1871 M. Jamin communicated to the French Academy
of Sciences a short note by M. Gramme, on a magneto-
electric machine which gave electrical currents always in
the same direction by the revolution of an electro-magnetic
ring between the poles of a permanent magnet. The
construction of the electro-magnetic or ring armature in
Gramme's machine differs in some mechanical details
from that of the transversal electro-magnet of Pacinotti,

lion, the intensity of which will increase till the loop
reaches s', after which the current, always preserving the
same direction, will diminish till the loop arrives at o',
when the current will for a moment fall to zero, to be
succeeded by a current in the opposite direction as the
loop leaves o'. This current will in like manner increase
during the advance of the loop to n', when it will attain
a maximum, and afterwards diminish till it arrives at o,
where, after passing through zero, the direction will again
change. There will thus be a current always flowing
in one direction as the loop moves from O through S' to
o', and in an opposite direction as it moves from o'
through n' to O. Now if the loop, instead of being
moveable upon thejring, be firmly attached to it, and the
ring itself carrying the loop be rotated on its axis in the
plane of the fixed magnet N M S, it will be found that the
currents developed will correspond both in direction and
intensity with those produced in the moveable loop, pro-
vided we allow for the small displacement in the position
of the poles of the ring arising from its motion.
The foregoing statement maybe extended from a single

loop to any number of loops forming part of a coil ex-
tending over the whole of the iron ring (Fig. 4). Each
loop of such a coil, during one-half of every revolution,
will tend to give a current in one direction, and during
the other half, a current in the opposite direction, and the
electromotive force thus produced will augment with the
number of loops in the coil. If, then, metallic conductors,
cc,(?V, are applied to the loops (whose surfaces must be
exposed at one point for this purpose) as they pass through
the positions o and o', continuous currents, all in the
same direction, will be obtained on rotating the ring with-
out the use of a commutator, unless we apply that term
(as Pacinotti has done) to the system of conductors or
rheophori by which the currents are carried off.
In order to obtain currents of high intensity, the single
coil must be replaced, as in similar machines, by a num-
ber of coils of thin wire rolled one above the other and
carefully insulated. To carry oft the current, these coils
must be divided into separate helices, with the adjacent
terminals of the'wires of the helices in metallic connec-
tion, so that the iron ring may be always surrounded by
an endless conductor of great length. I have already
described the arrangements adopted in the transversal
electro-magnet of Pacinotti. The construction of the
ring armature in Gramme's machine will be readily un-

which the contiguous ends of the wires of the helices are

means of rubbers or brushes formed of flexible bundles of
copper wire. These brushes are so applied at the neutral
positions of the ring that they begin to touch one of the
conductors R, before they have left the preceding one. In
this way no actual break or interruption occurs in the
current. The permanent magnets employed in the smaller

occurs.
An interesting experiment may be made with these
machines, which illustrates a well-known dynamical prin-
ciple, by turning the machine at a steady rate, with the
wires for transmitting the current disconnected, and
observing the great additional force required to maintain
the motion on connecting the wires.
The machine may be converted into an electro-mag-
netic one by transmitting the current from a voltaic pile
through the helices of the iron ring, which will then rotate
upon its axis. If the current be supplied by another
magneto-electric machine, the same result will be pro-
duced, and we shall thus have mechanical force, after
assuming the form of current electricity, reappearing, but
with some loss, in the form of mechanical force. In an
experiment on the large scale described by M. Breguet,
the loss amounted only to thirty per cent. If during this
experiment the machine which supplies the current has
its motion reversed, the other machine will soon come to
rest, and afterwards begin to turn in the opposite direc-

tion. The intensity of the current, M. Breguet remarks,
augments with the velocity of the rotation, the electro-
motive force having been proved by experiment to be
proportional to the velocity. At first view it might appear
that the resistance would remain constant; but as the
intensity is found not to be proportional to the velocity
of an invariable circuit, we are led to the conclusion
that the resistance of the machine is not constant. This
important point has been established by M. Sabine, but
the details of his experiments have not been published.
The increase of resistance is, however, so small, that a
machine which gives with a velocity of 100 turns per
minute a current equal to that of one small Bun sen's
element, will give with a double velocity a current equal
to two such elements a little larger, and with a quadruple
velocity a current equal to four still larger elements of
Bunsen. It is certain that this increase of electromotive
force cannot be indefinite, but must tend towards a limit;
but this limit does not appear to have been reached even
with a velocity of 3,000 turns per minute.

ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HUMAN
BODY DURING MOUNTAIN-CLIMBING
IN the year 1869 both Dr. Wm. Marcet, of Nice,* and Dr.

;ut t: ic experiments prosecuted by themselves on them-
selves during the ascent of Mont Blanc. Both physio-
logists discovered that during the act of ascent, if it were
rapid and prolonged for any considerable time, the tem-
perature of the body fell considerably, as much as 3'6° F.
in the case of the English, and even 8'6° F. of the French
observer. The temperature was taken in the mouth, and
read off by means of a small reflector attached to the
thermometer, which is a much more satisfactory manner
of recording reducing temperatures than the employment
of maximum registering instruments. Dr. Marcet tells
us that in order to assure himself that the cooling of the
body during the ascent was really due to the muscular
effort, and not to the effect of the rarefaction of the air,
he made one ascent (from Cormayeur to the plateau of
Mont-Frety, about 2,440 yards high) partly on mule-back.
Alter having gone two-thirds the distance, his tempera-
ture was 97'5 F., when, leaving the mule, he performed
the rest of the journey on foot as quickly as possible.
Just before arriving at the end, his temperature was not
above 95° F., or 2-5° below what it was thirty-five minutes

sents the average temperature of his own body at the
different hours of the day, in order that he might elimi-
nate this factor as a disturbing cause in his special obser-
vations. The curve represents an elevation of the
temperature between the hours of 3 and 9 A.M., and a fall
between 9 p.m. and 2 A.M., with an elevated temperature
during the day, the undulations of which are far from
constant and are difficult to characterise. In employing
these results practically, Dr. Forel has introduced a
method of turning them to account, which is as useful as
it is precise and ingenious. In any special experiment,
calling t the temperature, and T the normal temperature

curve, then

and that which, under ordinary circumstances, it would
be, either above or below it. As examples, we will take

On a second occasion, at the same time of day, the
temperature observed was 9878° F., from which it is
evident that
/' = - 0*31.
By the employment of this very simple means, there-
fore, the complications dependent on the time of day at
which an observation is made may be immediately eli-
minated; all comparisons being between the different
values of t, and not of /. Whether the assumption that
the daily curve of body-temperature-change depends on
the time of the day at which the observation is made, and
on the time only, is a question into which the author does
not enter, notwithstanding that such is the case has been
by no means proved.
Turning now to the results arrived at from the investi-
gation, the position in which the subject was left by
Marcet and Lortet may be thus summarised :—
1. The temperature of the body, as a rule, falls during
the act of ascending an incline.
2. During the time of the "mountain sickness," which
so frequently accompanies the ascent of lofty heights, the
body-temperature falls in a very marked manner.
Dr. Forel's earlier experiments, conducted in 1871, in
which the thermometer was retained in the mouth, as was
done by Marcet and Lortet, being directly opposite in their
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tendency, led him to commence the whole subject in 1872,
as he remarks ab ovo, under his improved conditions.
As to the effect of an uncomplicated ascent, two in-
stances are given in full, in both of which a consider-
able rise in temperature accompanied a rapid ascent of
about an hour's duration. In one of these, at the end of
the journey, the thermometer registered io2'5° F., whereas
it was slightly below ioo° F. on starting.
In a second series, three illustrations are given of the
effect of well-marked fatigue, just short of exhaustion.
The following are the deductions drawn fiom them :—
1. Even in conditions of great fatigue, the human body
rises in temperature upon the muscular effort of ascending
a height.
2. It is impossible for the author to determine if the
elevation of animal heat due to the movement of ascension
diminishes in proportion to the increase of the muscular
fatigue.
Next as to the influence of an empty stomach on the
temperature curve ; and it must be noted, with regard to
this point, that both Marcet and Lortet have stated that

ledge, and described the organisation of the new Society and
the task which lies before it. He showed what advantages a
Society so situated had over European societies for extending our
knowledge of Africa, and pointed out what yet remained to
be done ere the topography of North Africa could be considered
anything like completely known. We notice that the principal
geographical societies of Europe and Americ a have sent their
congratulations to Dr. Schweinfurth on the founding of this
Society; England's name, however, is not mentioned.
Mr. Macleay, who has organised the expedition to New
Guinea, our readers may remember, has already liberally endowed

New Guinea is a 400-ton man-of-war. His chief object is 10

Society, undertook a journey last year into the region of the
Upper Volga, chiefly for zoological purposes, though he also

obtained some important geologico geographical results, an
account of which appears in Heft vi. of Petermann's Mit'.hcil-
ungen. From the observations which he made, Poljakow con-
cludes that the Scandinavian Finlandic glacier which once held
in its fetters the government of Olonez and the neighbouring
governments, must have stretched far into the basin of the Volga
and over the boundaries of the Waldai plateau ; and that by the
unequal levels of the lakes formed by the melting of the glacier,the
slender remains of which are seen in the existing lakes, undoubt-
edly a connection existed between the basin of the Volga and the
Arctic and Baltic seas. Judging from the fauna, Poljakow concludes
that the present upper course of the Volga must have been joined
to the middle and lower course at a recent period and in a man-
ner accidentally. The upper river has an entirely different and
indeed a more northern water fauna than the middle and lower
river. In this respect is the Scheksna to be considered the natural
upper part of the Volga, for it contains the very same fishes as that
river as far as Bjelosero.
Dr. Forel, of Lausanne, has for several years been investi-
gating what are known as the Seiches of the Lake of Geneva.
Seiche is applied locally to certain oscillatory movements which
are occasionally seen to occur on the surface of the lake. The
phenomenon had been investigated by previous observers, among
others by Saussure and Vaucher, who attributed the pheno-
menon to variations in atmospheric pressure; in this, Forel, who
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
has most minutely investigated the phenomenon, agrees with
them. The phenomenon is found to occur on other Swiss lakes,
and Forel believes it will be found in all large bodies of water.
Indeed, he recognises in the Seiche probably the most con-
siderable and the grandest oscillatory movement which can
be studied on the surface of the globe. His investiga-
tions have led him to the conclusion that the Seiche on the
Swiss lakes is an oscillatory undulation (ondulatien de balance-
meni), having a true rhythm, and that the phenomenon
is not occasional, but constant, though varying in degree.
The duration of a Seiche is a function of the length and depth of
the section of the lake along which it oscillates; this duration
increases directly with the length and inversely with the depth
of the lake. The instrument he has devised for the investigation
of the phenomenon he calls a plfmyramitre {" tide-measurer").
A detailed account of Forel'a investigations will be found in two

first as Assistant, then as 'Ordinary' Professor of Physiology,

His own special work has lain most in the line of the senses and
the nervous system, the territory common to mind and matter;

an eminently well-qualified teacher of mental science. Indeed,

spiritualistic tendencies keep house together most amicably in

appointments as these as hopeful tokens of a new era in philo-

subjective and the objective methods shall have disappeared,
and in which it shall be admitted that the only hope of reaching
gnttral truths that all may accept is through the co-operation of
all in the minute investigation of special mental processes. We

RECENT PRoGRKXS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE
OF THE CILIATE INFUSORIA*
T BELIEVE that the object contemplated by the addresses
which it has been the custom of your Presidents to deliver year
after year to the Fellows of the Linnean Society will be best
fulfilled by making them as much as possible the exponent of
recent progress in biological science. The admirable addresses

with which my distinguished predecessor has during bis long
tenure of office so greatly enriched our journal, afford an example
as regards the exposition of botanical research which may well be
followed in biology generally. The field, however, which thus
offers itself is so wide, the activity in almost every department so
intense, that the necessity of restricting the exposition within a
limited area becomes imperative if it be expected to produce
anything like a definite picture instead of a vast assemblage of
images coniused and ill-defined by their very multiplicity and by
the condensation which would be in<eparable from their
treatment.
While thus imposing on myself these necessary limits, it is
almost at random that 1 have chosen for this year's address some
account of tlie progress which has recently been made in our
knowledge of the CILIATE INFUSOUIA—a group of organisms
whose very low position in the animal kingdom in no way lessens
their interest for the philosophic biologis', or their significance in
relation to general morphological laws.
To enable you to form a correct estimate of the value of recent
researches, it may be well to bring before you in the first place,
as shortly as possible, the chief steps which have led up to the
present stand-point of our knowledge of these organisms.
It is scarcely necessary to remind you that the first important
advance which during the present century was made in our know-
ledge of the Infusoria dates from the publication of the grest
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
work of Ehrenberg,* whose unrivalled industry opened up a new
field of research when, by his expressive figures and well-con-
structed diagnoses, he made us acquainted wiih the external
forms of whole hosts of microscopic organisms of which we had
been hitherto entirely ignorant, or which were known only by
such figures and descriptions as the earlier observers with their
very imperfect microscopes were able to give us.
Ehrenbcrg, however, as we all know, did not content himself
with pourtraying the external forms of the microscopic organisms
to whose study he had devoted himself, but sought also to deter-
mine their internal structure, of which scarcely anything had
been hitherto known. In this direction, no less than in the other,
the perseverance of the celebrated microscopist never flagged;
but, unfortunately, at the very commencement of his researches
he slid into a misleading path, and was never again able to find
the right one. •
Everyone knows how Ehrenberg, in accordance with precon-
ceived notions of ihe high organisation of all animals, attributed
to the Infusoria a complicated structure ; how, while he rightly
distinguished them from the Rotifers with which iliey had been
confounded by previous observers, he yet regarded them as

cleavage had in many cases an entirely different significance;
that it was, in fact, not the cleavage of a single individual, but
the conjugation of two distinct ones; and he connected this
phenomenon with what he regarded as a tiue sexual act.
It was then known that besides the nucleus which occupied a
conspicuous position in the protoplasmic mass, there existed in
many Infusoria another differentiated body similar to the nucleus
but smaller, and either in close contact with it or separated
from it by a greater or less interval. To this body the
ill-chosen name of " nucleolus" had been given. Now, Bal-
biani's observations led him to believe that under the influ-
ence of conjugation this so-called nucleolus underwent a
change and developed in its interior a multitude of exceedingly
minute filaments or rod-like bodies, to which he attributed the
significance of spermatozoa; while at the same time the nucleus
became divided into globular masses, which Balbiani regarded
as eggs, and in which lie believed he could recognise a germinal
vesicle and germinal spot. We should thus, according to this
interpretation, have in the Infusoria the two essential elements

accepts in its general facts the sexual theory, and maintains the
spermatic nature of the rod-like corpuscles to which the nucleolus
appears to give rise. But however real may be the phenomena
described by Balbiani and by Stein, the correctness of assigning
to them a sexual significance may be called in question ; and it
is certain that subsequent observation has not tended to confirm
the hypothesis that we have in the Infusoria true eggs fecundated
by true spermatozoa.
Claparede and Lachmann, two able and indefatigable ob-
servers fresh from the school of the great anatomist Johan
Miiller, now entered the field, and their joint labours have given
us a great work on the Infusoria.* In this an entirely new view
of the morphology of the Infusoria has been introduced. Re-
ceding widely from the unicellular theory of Siebold, they
approximate towards the views of Ehrenberg in assigning to the
Infusoria a comparatively complex structure; but instead of
adopting the polygastric theory of the Prussian microscopist,
they attribute to the Infusoria a single well-defined gastric cavity
occupying the whole of the space limited externally by the outer
firm boundary walls of the softer protoplasmic mass ; while this
mass is regarded by then) as nothing more than a sort of chyme
by which the gastric cavity is filled. According to this view,
the nearest relations of the Infusoria would be found among the
zoophytes, and their proper systematic seat would be in the
primary group of the Ccelenterata.

Though few zoologists will now be prepared to accept the
conclusions of the Genevan naturalists, the ccelenterate relations
of the Infusoria has recently found an advocate in Greeff. + In
an elaborate memoir on the Vorticella?, Greeff sees in the very
well-marked distinction between the external or cortical layer
and the internal soft body-substance, a proof of the views main-
tained by Claparede and Lachmann; and he considers this
position still further confirmed by the presence in Epistylis
flazneans of numerous oval or piriform, brilliant, well-defined
capsules, which are generally distributed in pairs below the outer
layer, and which, under the influence of a stimulus, emit a long
filament, thus closely resembling the thread-cells so well known
as characteristic elements in certain tissues of the Ccelenterata.
It must be here remarked that the presence of similar bodies
in the Infusoria, where they have been described under the
name of trichocysts, has long been known. Though varying in
form, they all possess a more or less close resemblance to the
thread-cells of the Ccelenterata. Their presence undoubtedly
indicates a step upwards in the differentiation of the organism,
but, as we shall presently see, it offers no valid argument against
its unicellularity.

SCIENTIFIC SERIALS
THE current number of the Jburnal of Anatomy and Physi-
ology contains much valuable scientific work, together with its
excellent Reports on the progress of Anatomy and Physiology,
by Prof. Turner and Dr. Stirling. The first paper is one on the
freezing process for section-cutting, and on various methods of
staining and mounting sections, by Mr. Lawson Tait. The
author prefers the non-employment of chromic acid, picric acid,
and other chemically-interfeting agents. His section-cutter is a
modification of Stirling's, a freezing tank of considerable size
being added. The air-bubbles are removed from the sections by
the action of boiled water. Logwood and litmus are preferred
as staining agents, and their operation is given in proof of the
nuclei of cells being, contrary to ordinary ideas, alkaline.—Prof.
Flower, in a note on the construction and and arrangement of
anatomical museums, makes several very valuable suggestions,
which should be specially studied by those who have anything
to do with the establishment and construction of biological mu-
seums. He shows how that in lofty rooms, with galleries, lighted
at the ceiling-wall junction, the preparations have to be arranged
according to their manner of preservation; dry, in bottles, and
otherwise; which involves the separation of those illustrating any

all the specimens illustrating any single subject, however pre-

subjects.—Dr. Hollis remarks, with several interesting historical
references, on lopsided generation.—The next paper is by Mr.
Walter Pye, entitled observations on the development and struc-
ture of the kidney. The relation of the capsule to the Mai.
pighian tuft is explained upoa the peculiarities observed in the
developing organ in a manner differing from the results of Riedel.
The characters of the ascending limbs of Henle's loops are de-
scribed in detail. A plate accompanies the paper.—Mr. Lowne,
in a note on the mechanical work of respiration, desires to prove
that the amount of work performed in the respiratory act is much
less than is usually stated, from calculations based on the relation
between the velocity of moving gases and the pressure producing
motion.—Dr. Howden describes a case of atrophy of the right
hemisphere of the cerebrum attended with the same condition of
the left side of the cerebellum and the left side of the body, in a
•woman aged 30.—Prof. Turner figures and describes the Spiny
Shark (Echinorhintts spinosut) from a specimen captured near
Bass Rock, six-and-a-half feet long. The ureters were found to
open into the cloaca by a single orifice. There was no cement
gland in the oviduct, from which it is evident that the ova have
no horny case. The stomach is succeeded by a pyloric tube;

that the former possesses two large duodenal caeca and no ovi-
ducts, whilst in the latter creca are absent and oviducts deve-
loped. Prof. Turner also proves, from a specimen caught off the
mouth of the Frith of Forth, that the Postbeagle Shark (Lamna
comubica) possesses a spiracle, contrary to the opinion of most
authorities.—Mr. D. J. Cunningham gives notes on the Great
Splanchnic Ganglion. In twenty-six cases, he failed to detect its

position of the femur and on its so-called "true neck."—Drs.
Kronecker and Stirling describe in detail experiments on the

from the Bay of Naples. The following papers were then
read:—On the Barringtoniaceoe, by J. Miers, F.R.S. The pur-
pose of this paper is to show that the Barringtoniaceoe consti-
tute a distinct order, forming an extremely natural group with
peculiar and uniform characters, differing from the Myrtaceic in
their alternate leaves without pellucid dots, and in the nature of
their inflorescence and fruit. They are trees, frequently of
large size, rarely low shrubs, all delighting in running
streams, some growing in estuaries or along the sea-shore.
The author describes the characters of the order in consi-
derable detail, and gives the diagnosis—in many cases re-
drawn from actual examination—of each genus and species.
The number of genera he makes to be ten. The paper was
accompanied with drawings illustrating the floral and car-

make their appearance on the plots would throw some light on
the much-disputed question of the source of the nitrogen of the
Leguminosoe. It is remarkable that although, according to
published analyses of various fungi, from one-fouith to one-tliird
of their dry substance consists of albuminoids or nilrogenous
matter, and 8 to 10 per cent, of mineral matters or ash, of which
about So per cent, is potassium phosphate; yet the fungi develop
into "fairy rings" only on the plots poorest in nitrogen and
poorest in potash. The questions which appear still to require
solution are these :—(1) Is the greater prevalence of fungi under
such circumstances due to the manurial conditions themselves
being directly favourable to their growth? or (2) Are the lower
orders of plants—in consequence of other plants and especially
grasses growing so sluggishly under such conditions—better able
to overcome the competition and to assert themselves? (3) Do
the fungi prevail simply in virtue of the absence of adverse and
vigorous competition, or to a greater or less extent as parasites,
and so at the expense of the sluggish underground growth of the
plants in association with them? or (4) Have these plants the
power of assimilating nitrogen in some form from the atmo-
sphere; or in some form or condition of distribution within the

known as a night dial; it was used about the end of the sixteenth
century for finding the time at night by the position of the
pointers of the Great Hear. The observer stood with his face to
the north, and the instrument was held in one hand, so that a
line upon it was by estimation vertical to the horizon ; and with
the other a moveable arm like a clock hand was turned until it
was parallel to the direction of the pointers. The time was then
read upon the circumference of a boxwood circle, which had to
l>e set afresh for every night of the year. The other instrument
was a Backstaff, which was used at sea until the invention of the
sextant for determining the sun's altitude. The observer in using
it stood with his back to the sun (whence its name), and he
measured the arc between the sun's place and the opposite horizon
through the zenith. The instrument which was in use before this
was a very simple contrivance, being merely a pole along which
a moveable bar at right-angles was shifted, until the cross-bar
subtended the same angle when looked at by the observer with
his eye at the end of the pole as the sun's altitude. Such
contrivances were called Forestaffs, and were in use at sea until

more easily distinguished when its light was diminished than a
star with a blue tinge.

CKOLL'S "CLIMATE AND TIME'*
Climate and Time in their Geological Relations j a theory
of Secular Changes of the EartKs Climate. By James
Croll, of H.M. Geological Survey of Scotland. (London:
Ualdy, Isbister, and Co., 1875.)
II.
MR. CROLL'S own theory about the distribution of
heat by means of ocean currents is in intimate
connection with bis ideas as to the variation of climate in
past time. His theory may be summarised as follows :—
The Gulf Stream and 'other warm or cold currents are
due entirely to the prevailing system of winds, which
force the water along the surface, or even make it take a
lower course; the return of the colder water from the
Arctic regions being assisted by the difference of level
caused by driving up the waters into a narrow basin, such
as he supposes those regions to be. The result of this
theory is, that if one hemisphere is colder than the -other,
the trades on that hemisphere will be strongest, and the
resulting warm current will flow into the warmer hemi-
sphere ; any difference, therefore, in the mean temperature
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
of one hemisphere from that of the other is augmented
according to this theory by ocean circulation, whereas on
Dr. Carpenter's theory the latter would have a counter-
acting influence. When, however, we take both theories
into account, and also the effect of the distribution of land
and sea, which is remarkably manifested by the two facts
of the South Atlantic being coldest and the North Pacific
also coldest, we see that we are not in a position to
estimate the effect, if any of much consequence, of the
different forms of ocean circulation on the occurrence of
a glacial epoch, but must look for the causes of the latter
independently.
Now what are the known facts to be explained? They
are well described in various parts of this book, and the
proofs of the less known are carefully given. We have first
the widespread indications of a sheet of land ice in the
northern hemisphere, reaching in some parts far down
into temperate, if not into tropical regions; secondly,
similar indications in the southern hemisphere during the
same geological period, but without any proof of their
being contemporaneous eren in centuries with those in
the northern; thirdly, a much milder climate than at
present prevailing in very high latitudes in comparatively
modern geological periods, though anterior to the glacial
epoch ; fourthly, that these changes from more intense cold
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to more intense heat have been going on throughout the
whole of geological time; and lastly, that in the midst
even of the glacial epoch, warm interglacial periods oc-
curred. No satisfactory theory of the cause of the glacial
epoch can leave any of these facts unaccounted for, still
less contradicted. Sir Charles Lyell's theory, referring it
to an alteration of the distribution of land and sea, does
not well adapt itself to the magnitude of the phenomena
indicated above in the first and second facts, and requires
very sudden and violent changes to account for the fifth;
and, moreover, it is shown by Mr. Croll that the distribu-
tion he indicates would have the very opposite effect to

that supposed ; geologists are therefore driven, however
reluctantly, to consider the [action of cosmical Causes.
Four theories founded on such causes have been pro-
posed.
The first, that the solar system was passing through a
cold region of space, may be dismissed at once; the
second is that the sun is a variable star, and therefore

result, and we must look to the indirect effects. While
agreeing in the existence of many of those pointed out by
Mr. Croll, we cannot think it quite so settled a matter as
he does, as they do not all act in the same way. In the
first place, though the total amounts of summer and
winter heat together are equal in the two hemispheres,
yet, since a larger pioportion of the greater summer heat
is available than of the smaller winter heat, the more
unequal these are, it follows generally that more heat
must be obtained, and therefore the more uniformly
heated hemisphere will be coldest ; but secondly, as Mr.
Croll states, we must consider the formation of snow, i.e.
take into account the latent heat of water and other physi-
cal properties. Some of his arguments on this point are
rather circular, for whatever amount of heat is rendered
latent in the melting of ice, as much will be supplied to
radiation in the freezing ; and no increase of ice would
arise from this. There are, however, two points that
seem to be made out. First, that snow and ice are better
reflectors of light than almost any other substance, and
therefore less heat enters into them; and, secondly, that
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
moist air is much less transparent to heat than dry, so
that the vapour raised by the sun in summer would be an
opposing influence, whereas the frozen vapour in winter
when fallen as snow would leave the air above freer for
radiation. This result would overbalance that spoken of
in the first place, and be a powerful influence in the pro-
duction of a glacial epoch. The vapour, too, that was
raised in summer would come in a large degree from the
warmer tropics, and therefore continue to add each
winter to the mass of the snow and ice in the more polar
regions.
These seem to us to be among the most convincing of
Mr. Croll's arguments, and they are in agreement, as he
shows, with the condition of the earth at the present time
as regards the more glaciated condition of the southern
hemisphere, and they agree with what has been pointed
out by Prof. Tyndall, that heat, to bring the snow in form
of vapour, is just as necessary for a glacial epoch as cold
to freeze it when brought. It has been argued by Mr.
Murphy that under exactly the same circumstances it
would be the more equally heated hemisphere that would
be glaciated, as the cool summer would melt less snow;
but according to the above theory the summer of the
other hemisphere, though naturally hotter, would also be
rendered cool at the earth's surface. We see that the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
whole of this argument depends on the relation of the
atmosphere to heat rays, and what has been stated
above has been experimentally verified; yet we are far
from being fully informed on this point, and the example
of the planet Mars, which is almost exactly under the
circumstances of great eccentricity and winter aphelion
supposed above, and yet has not much glaciation, teaches
us that this may depend on other combinations of cir-
cumstances beyond those we have considered above.
The glaciation, Mr. Croll thinks, would be assisted by
the deflection of ocean currents, on which he accordingly
spends his strength; but the vertical circulation of Dr.
Carpenter, no less proved than the influence of the Gulf
Stream, would be antagonistic to this, and we may safely
leave the unknown residuum out of consideration.
Such is Mr. Croll's theory of the cause of the glacial epoch,
to the illustration of which he brings forward many interest-
ing facts. Among these are the proofs he gives of the occur-
rence of warm interglacial periods. Some of these proofs
are collected from other writers, but many are from his
own observations, and consist of the intercalation of beds

increase in the obliquity of the ecliptic would cause a greater
difference in the seasons, and this difference we have seen
to be the very basis of Mr. CroJl's own theory; the
results must be the same (and they are rightly seen by
Mr. Belt), whatever may be the cause of the difference
between summer and winter temperature. If this theory
were the true one, it is plain that both hemispheres were
glaciated at the same time, so that both theories cannot
be true ; but the matter of fact as to the synchronism
or otherwise of the glaciation of two hemispheres can
never in the nature of things be determined. But we
have still left the question, Has there been or can there
be any great change in the obliquity? Astronomers say
no. Mr. Belt, however, thinks that the distribution of
sea and land and similar causes may make it possible for
greater changes to occur—a gratuitous supposition that
Mr. Croll shows to be groundless. This cause, then,
though it may have the general effect of lowering the
temperature of temperate and Arctic regions, is not suf-
ficient to cause a glacial epoch.
On the whole, then, there appear to be several indepen-
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
dent cosmical causes which affect climate in a greater or
less degree, and the probable truth is that a glacial epoch
occurs when they all conspire to bring about the same
result.
So far, by going from chapter to chapter, we have
endeavoured to bring Mr. Croll's arguments into some-
thing like logical order. The remainder of the book
scarcely admits of this; indeed, we think the author
might well have bestowed more care in arranging his
matter if it was intended to form a consecutive whole;
as it stands, there is much that can only be called a mis-
cellaneous collection of essays without any obvious con-
nection. Among these are his accounts of observations
on the North of England ice-sheet, and his specula-
tions as to the direction of its motion. There are also
two theoretical questions of 'great interest discussed—
"The physical cause of the submergence and emer-
gence of the land during the glacial epoch," and " The
physical cause of the motion of glaciers." With regard
to the first of these questions, there are undoubted proofs
that great oscillations of the relative level of land and sea
have taken place in recent geological times, and the ques-
tion arises, Was it the land which sank and rose, or the
sea which changed its level? It was rightly considered
one of the grand discoveries of geology when it was first
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
taught that the changeable sea was that which retained its
constant level, and that the " eternal hills " had been but
as yesterday beneath the waters ; and this principle is
not likely to pass away. By it all alterations of level
have been ascribed to the motion of the land, and none to
the rising of the sea. While agreeing, however, to the
principle, we may doubt its universality, and may be pre-
pared to entertain the question whether causes of limited
extent may not operate to raise the level of the sea, and
thus enable us to account more naturally for such rapid
changes as are sometimes indicated. There can be no
question but that any considerable amount of water which
by the fact of freezing should be retained in either polar
region, and form an ice-cap there, would correspondingly
shift the earth's centre of gravity and draw the remaining
water more over to the side on which the ice-cap lay; and the
amount of elevation of sea-level might easily be calculated
for any latitude, if we knew the extent of the cap and its
manner of deposition, i.e. its shape; and the amount
would be doubled if the ice-cap were first on one hemi-
sphere and then transferred to the other. This calcula-

molecule must melt at the same instant, and so on to the
other end of the glacier, which is absurd; and besides,
what is there in this theory to distinguish a glacier from a
common piece of ice? which on this principle ought to
flatten out and not retain its shape as it does. Why also
are we to suppose the molecule alternately to melt and
crystallise when the heat is continuous? The mistake
on which this explanation is founded seems to be the
confounding of radiation with conduction. It is radiant
heat that passes through ice, which is a very bad con-
ductor. Ice at 32° F., heated by conduction, would cer-
tainly melt on the outside; the interior can only melt by
the absorption of radiant heat. We cannot either under-
stand the statement "that ice at 32° cannot take on
energy from a heated body without melting," unless it is
the exact equivalent of what we have just said; but then
no heat could be transmitted, as it would be consumed in
melting the ice, and if it were otherwise, still any amount
of heat short of the latent heat of water might be " taken

SPRAGUE'S ELECTRICITY
Electricity; its Theory, Sources, and Applications. By
John T. Sprague. (London: E. and F. N. Spon,
1875.)
THE author tells us in his preface that this book is
"written chiefly for that large and increasing class
of thinking people who find pleasure in the study of
science, and seek to obtain a full and accurate scientific
knowledge for its own sake, or as part of the necessary
mental preparation for many of the departments of modern
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
life." Our examination of the book itself would lead us
to an opposite conclusion. We very much question
whether any one of the class to whom the author refers
will ever have the patience to read through this volume.
Certainly they will have but sorry pleasure and any-
thing but full and accurate information. The book
abounds in foolish conceits advanced with a show of
knowledge that cannot but repel every intelligent reader.
That we are justified in these strictures will be seen
from one or two quotations. Here, for example, are some
statements taken from chapter ii. in this book. At the
outset the author asserts that the fundamental facts
relating to frictional electricity given in "one of our
standard electrical works (and it is just what all say) . . .
are received as absolute truth by electricians . . . and
yet there is scarcely a truth in them which is not over-
weighted by an error, and the simplest facts even are
erroneously stated " (p. 17). Mr. Sprague, so far as we
are aware, has never done anything to prove that he is
able to sit in judgment on the intellectual giants among
modern men of science. Mere off-hand condemnation

that is discussed with great detail, too much so, however,
for a general treatise. The author has evidently been at
no little pains to collect the numerous tables he gives,
and in some instances they are the results of his own
experiments. There is also a freshness and originality in
the treatment of the sections on resistance and electro-
motive force that make us regret Mr. Sprague did not
submit his theoretical views to some scientific friend
before sending his work to the press. If the author had
confined himself to the practical part of current electricity
we should gladly have recommended his book to our
readers.

The number of the Anales now before us completes the
second volume of this remarkable work, and gives us
additional proof of the extraordinary richness of the
extinct Mammalian Fauna of the Argentine Republic, to
which Dr. Burmeister has devoted so much attention.
The Monograph of the Glyptcdonts, or extinct gigantic
fossil Armadillos, which is now brought to a conclusion,
is certainly one of the most valuable contributions to
palaeontological science that has been produced of late
years, and deserves the hearty commendation of all natu-
ralists. This is more especially the case when we con-
sider the difficulties under which the work has been
carried on—in a new country, where every man avidus Ittcri
is striving to advance his own material interests, and sci-
ence and all that pertains to it are at an utter discount. On
one occasion, we have been told,when one of the most per-
fect of these Glyptodont skeletons came into the market, the
authorities of the National Museum were unwilling or un-
able to raise the necessary funds to secure it, and it would
have left the country and been lost to Dr. Burmeister

Peculiarities of Stopped Pipes, Humming-tops, and
other Varieties of Organ-pipes
THE peculiarities of a stopped organ-pipe as compared with
an open organ-pipe are many and suggestive, and are of the
utmost importance to the investigator both to know and to
interpret. Without entering deeply into the principles of the
craft of organ-building, there are certain matters of (act very
necessary to be known before the full bearing of a theory can be
estimated or its consistency be judged with true understanding.
By far the greater portion of an organ consists of pipes of the
s ructure called "flue-pipes," or, as here named, "air-reed"

fication of a philosopher's misapprehension, and is meant to show-
not only that an organ-pipe behaves itself in a manner different to
that with which it is accredited, but also why it does so; to show
how important a matter in the nature of its action is this neglected
difference, and how wide its bearing on the whole system of mu-
sical instruments. Here at my hand is a stopped pipe sounding
mid C. I measure it interiorly from languid to stopper; it is
eleven inches in length, and has a diameter of one-and-a-half
inches. Here is an open pipe, same pitch, same diameter, and
its length is twenty-three inches. Observe, our stopped pipe is
half an inch less in length than half that of the open pipe; yet
again notice, it is longer than that pipe would be if severed at
the true nodal distance from the languid. How can we read
eleven as precisely thirteen, and twenty-three as twenty-six
inches? Under the strange notion that it is no matter if there
is a difference, this has been done, and the truth of facts lost
sight of or disguised in the convenient phrase, "approximately
correct." The phrase assumes that there is a standard claiming
nature's allegiance. We want to know, not what is correct, but
what is true? Further, remark that if you stop the same open
pipe at the top, the note obtained will not be an octave deeper,

it will be nearly a tone sharper than that; if you stop the pipe
at the centre, the note will not be the same as the open one, it
will be considerably flatter; in neither case a good tone, since
for its proper sounding in such condition the lip would require
to be cut higher, mouth a little narrower, perhaps curved, and
languid lowered. Every detail we come upon tells plainly of
the working power of the reed affecting variably the results in
pitch, and I think the reason for these distinctive sounding
lengths will be discerned when we reach the consideration of
the question of periods of vibration in pipes as tempered by
rests.
The fundamental importance of the recognition that pipes of
the same pitch varied between themselves as to lengths, was not
perceived, nevertheless a qualifying condition was admitted that
pitch was "affected by depth of the pipe, that is, its distance
from front to back, but width does not affect pitch." As regards
"depth,"in no work within my knowledge does there exist any
attempt at a solution of the problem how such a result ensues
that depth interferes with pitch. It seems to be taken account
'of only as a d.sturber of the harmony of tilings, yet see how sig-
nircant it is under the new theory of the working abstracting
reed. The actual law operating admits of most precise state-
ment when this generating power is acknowledged, viz., the
difference of pitch in pipes ol varied diameter (other things being
equal) is proportional to the difference existing between the area
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ol the cross-section of the pipe and the area of the mouth ; the
difference in pitch is greatest when the depth from front to back
is greatest. It should be observed that increase of depth always
flattens pitch, and tends to deprive the pipe of harmonic force.
As regards the further assertion that "width " is without effect
on pitch, this also is inexact and misses the very point which
should have led to closer investigation. It is not true, because
the same amount of wind acting over a wider area cannot do the
larger extent of work with the same energy. The pitch of every
pipe is affected by the width of mouth relatively, that is to say,
its proportion to the diameter of the pipe. Apart Irom the
ordinary rectangular and cylindrical pipes there are others of so-
called " irregular shapes," which are usually viewed as monstro-
sities, out ot the pale even of law padded with exceptions; yet
these we shall find are the best evidence to us of the uniformity
of the principle of action set forth in these papers, and of the
consistency ot a theory which recognises no exceptions.
Cylindrical pipes, notwithstanding their symmetry, differ
greatly among themselves. The law by which due-pipes differ
lias never yet been noticed, which is singular, since it is very
striking when the pipes are thoughtfully observed, and gave the

The Double Star 2 2120.—In the notes to the last
catalogue of measures of double stars ol the late Rev.
W. R. Dawes, he remarks with reference to 2 2120, or, as
it has been frequently called, Herculis 210 (Bode) : "This
object discovered by Struve is undoubtedly a binary
system—the position varying in a retrograde sense, and
the distance diminishing." Notwithstanding this positive
opinion as to physical connection of the components by so
high an authority in this department of practical astro-
nomy, an examination of the path of the companion up to
the latest published measures of the Baron Dembowski
towards the end of 1870, or, it should be stated, through
a period of observation fifteen years longer than that upon
which the above opinion was expressed, does not support
the presumed binary character of the object, but on the
contrary, when the apparent fixity of the principal star is
considered, shows pretty decidedly that the variation of
angle and distance must be owing to proper motion of
the smaller one. In fact we may represent the measures,
from Struve's earliest in 1829, to Dembowski's in 1870,

II is evident that India offers far greater advantages
for investigating the variations of the solar heat than
any European country can do, and as observations of the
black-bulb thermometer in vacua have now been registered
at several stations during the last six or seven years,
I have lately examined a portion of these, to see if they
afford any direct evidence of a periodical graduated varia-
tion in the intensity of the radiation. 1'he result is to me
very striking, and if not absolutely conclusive as to the
direct variation of the sun's heat with the number of
the spots and prominences, certainly, as far as it goes,
strongly confirms Mr. Baxendell's conclusions, drawn
from indirect evidence.
It is unfortunate that owing to the fragility of the
instruments employed and the necessity of exposing them
freely, they are very frequently broken; and, as a conse-
quence, the longest series of observations made with one
and the same instrument extends over only five years.
This is at Silchar in Eastern Bengal. The place is
situated in lat. 25°, therefore beyond the tropic; and the

is, however, in favour of their more intimate reptilian affini-
ties. They are characterised externally by their covering of
feathers, and by the fore limbs being developed to form
wings. These wings, though primarily constructed for
flight, in some birds perform other functions. In the
Penguins they are employed for swimming, in the Ostrich
to assist in running, whilst in the Apteryx and the Casso-
wary their condition is so rudimentary that they can be
of no service to their owners. In the Night Parrot and
the Weka Rails the wings are very much diminished.
Birds are divided into from seventeen to twenty well-
marked groups, of which the Callings, the order which
contains the Pheasants, forms one which is more im-
portant in an economical point of view than any of the
others, as it contains most of the domesticated species of
birds, the ducks and pigeons being exceptions. The Game
Birds,as the Gallinre are commonly termed, may be divided
into the following seven sections :—i. The Ptcroclida,
or Sand Grouse, birds which inhabit Africa and Western
Asia. By some naturalists they are grouped with the
Pigeons ; they, however, differ from them and agree with

the fowls in laying coloured eggs, at the same time that
the young ones run about directly they are hatched.
There is one species, found in the steppes of Tartary, in
which, unlike its allies, the hind toe is absent. In the
year 1863 a flock of Sand Grouse spread over all Western
Europe. Prof. Newton tell us, in the " Ibis," that not less
than seven hundred individuals must have appeared. A
few stragglers were seen for a short time afterwards.
2. The Alcleagridcr, or Turkeys, are unfortunately so
called, as they are in their wild state confined to Northern
and Central America. Only three wild species are known,
the most northern of which is said to be the parent stock
of our domesticated form, although some of the evidence
is in favour of the latter having sprung from the Mexican
species. The Ocellatcd Turkey, from Honduras, is
a particularly handsome bird. 3. The Numididte, or
Guinea Fowl, are represented in Guinea by one spe-
cies. The four or five others are all confined to
Africa; of these, the elegant Vulturine Guinea Fowl,
of which several specimens have been presented to
the Zoological Gardens by Dr. Kirk, comes from
Zanzibar. 4. The Cracida, or Curassows, are the repre-
sentatives of the Game Birds in Central and South
America. They will not nest in captivity here, perhaps
because, as they are arboreal in their habits, it is not

possible to give them suitable abodes. They are said to
have been first introduced into Europe by the Dutch,
from the island of Curassow, in the West Indies. In
some species the cock and hen are identical in plumage;
in others very dissimilar. 5. The Me^apcdiiice, or Mega-
podes, are confined almost entirely to the Australian
region. They are nearly allied to the Cracida. Their
eggs are laid in the middle of a mound composed of
earth and grass, where they nre left to be hatched. Many-
eggs aie laid, and the young ones are able to fly within
twenty-four hours of leaving the egg. Their breeding
habits have been well described by Mr. Bartlett, from
examples which have laid in the Society's Gardens. By
one species the mound constructed is as much as 15 ft.
high and 60 ft. in circumference. The habits of one
peculiar species, the Maleo of Northern Celebes, have
been well described by Mr. Wallace. 6. The Tiimicidcr,
or Hemipodes, much resemble quails. They are mostly
African, one species occurring in Andalusia. Their
anatomy is somewhat peculiar. 7. The Phasianidcr, or

Atlantic Ocean traversed by the circuits of the " Brazilian

Madeira, St. Vincent, and the continent of South America
to Pernambuco. There it joins the coast submarine cir-
cuits of the " Western and Brazilian," extending north to
Para and south to Bahia, Rio Janeiro, Rio Grand do Sul,
and Monte Video in the River Plate, at which station, in
connection with the local lines of the River Plate Com-
pany, it reaches Buenos Ayres, thence by means of the
wires of the Argentine Republic, crosses the Andes into
Chili and Peru. From Para the electric circuit is ex-
tended (Para and Demerara being now under comple-
tion), by way of the West India Isles, Jamaica, and Cuba,
to Florida, there joining the extensive system of the
United States Trunk lines; to San Francisco, west, and
Newfoundland, east; and thence, by the circuits of the
"Anglo-American" and "Direct United States" cable,
crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Great Britain. Thus the
New World is also encircled by two great systems, the
one almost equatorial, the other within the higher degrees
of northern latitude.
In dealing with submarine circuits the electrician
has several matters to consider and accurately adjust,
some of which will be more fully considered hereafter.
First, there is the copper-conducting wire, its capacity
according to the length of the circuit. Too small a con-
ducting wire on a circuit of a given length would offer too
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
great a resistance; too large a conducting wire would be
equally faulty, induction increasing in greater proportion
from its large superficial surface than its increased
sectional area augments the speed. The exact sectional
area of the wire has therefore to be determined; then
for insulation, the best relative proportion in weight,
and sectional measurement between the wire and that of
the insulating material. Insulation, as is well known,
may be obtained by a mere film of a non-conductor sur-
rounding the wire. This is illustrated by the simple
experiment of passing a weak voltaic current of electricity
through an extended fine metallic wire immersed in a
trough of water. Under ordinary circumstances it is but
natural to suppose (water being a conductor) that there
would be no insulation; not so; by the action of the
current through the wire decomposing the water, a fine
non-conducting film of hydrogen is developed surround-
ing the wire, which, with a strength of current ad-
justed to the resistance of the wire, will separate the
water from the metallic conductor, perfect insulation being
maintained. Destroy the balance between the current

tioa vary in an extreme degree. Thus there is found
copper and insulation in the respective proportions by
weight of i to i, also 3 to 4, also 3 to 2, also 2 to 3, and
also in the irregular proportion of n to 14. By these
figures it appears that there is no accepted ratio, and
every new cable seems to be constructed according to
the electrical views of the designer, in some cases at an
enormous cost, as compared with others of similar length
and equal efficiency in transmitting power. Thus, by re-
ducing the weight of material per nautical mile into an
average money value, assuming for copper is. •id. per lb.,
and insulation 6s. perlb., we obtain the following ratios :—

tions by weight to ;be adopted between the conducting
wire and the external thickness of the insulator, to obtain
the best practical results at the least expenditure of
capital on a circuit of given length, worked with one of
the sensitive recording instruments already brought under
notice. As an example of the augmentation of speed
upon a submarine circuit, according to the delicacy of the
recording instrument employed, upon the Great Northern
cable between England and Denmark, 365 nautical miles
in length, with the most improved submarine morse, an
average of seventeen words per minute was obtained;
with the Wheatstone's automatic thirty words, and with
the Thompson syphon recorder fifty words per minute are
practically reached.
For many years there has existed a divided opinion as
to whether a light submarine cable, combining economy
of construction with mechanical facilities of laying, ij
not the right system to adopt as against the heavy
and more expensive form of iron covered cable. The
light cable theory may be said to be based upon the
opinion of the late Lieut M. F. Maury, who through
every opposition adhered in principle to light cables.
His argument may be expressed in his own words : " You
may snap a taut rope, but you cannot break a slack
line." This remark may nautically be quite true, but
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
electrically far from correct, for the following reasons. In
submerged cables, speed is greatest upon the shortest line.
Now, in deep-sea telegraphy, in the only circuits upon
which a light cable could possibly be employed with any
security against mechanical interruptions, two or three
points come into play. Supposing a light cable were to
be used over, say, a circuit of 2,000 miles, with an average
depth of 1,500 fathoms, or about ij miles. First, take
the specific gravity of the light cable as compared with
water, at what rate will it sink to the bottom? if not

SCIENCE IN GERMANY
(From a German Correspondent^)
SINCE Darwin first gave the signal for a complete
rupture with the old tradition of the morphology of
animals, Germany has zealously continued working in the
new direction, trying to bring anatomical, embryological,
and biological facts into causal connection with each
other by the comparative method. Darwin's theory re-
mains the basis, and it has been principally Hacckelwho,
in advance of all its supporters, deduced further important
consequences ; the antagonists of the theory have confined
themselves to a purely negative criticism. At one time
the whole theory with all its suppositions and deductions
was rejected by them; at another, the theory of descent
was accepted in principle, but the further representation
of its connection with the anatomy and the development
history of animals was refuted ; in all cases they either
returned to the old views openly or they were satisfied
with simple contradiction, leaving it to the future to fill up
the gaps thus produced in the theory. In a work that
has lately been published, the attempt has been made to

consider the whole science of the morphology of animals
from a different point of view. This work is: "Die
Entwicklungsgeschichte der Unke als Grundlage einer
vergleichenden Morphologic der Wirbelthiere" (the His-
tory of Development of Bonibinator igneus as the basis
of a Comparative Morphology of Vertebrata), by Dr.
Alexander Gotte, Professor of the University of Strass-
burg.
From a careful examination of the individual his-
tory of the development of Vertebrata and comparative
consideration of the lower types, Gotte tries to determine
the morphological laws for the individual species, and
from this to deduce their causal connection; he thus
arrives at certain general theorems which, according to
his view, form the basis for a conception of the origin of
new animal species, totally different from Darwin's view.
On the one side Gotte does not look upon the animal
ovum as a cell, nor in fact as a living organism at all;
this of course is different from all other theories hitherto
published. According to his view the cells, which are the
basis of the formation of the ovum, only produce a con-
glomeration of a certain material (yolk) in a certain
arrangement, but are themselves dissolved sooner or later,
so that the complete ovum is a peculiar body, not living,
but endowed with properties that enable it to be con-

verted into a living organism under certain conditions.
He maintains that this capacity lor development is not
the simple consequence of the chemical composition of
the yolk, but that it only contains the motive force which
is freed by chemical processes, and can do very different
work according to the physical conditions under which it
happens to be. The result may therefore as likely be the
destruction of the ovum as its further development. For
the latter, perfectly certain conditions of form are neces-
sary, which have already been initiated during the forma-
tion of the ovum, and cause the force in question to work
in a direction just as determined and certain as they are
themselves. The results in that case are self-divisions of
the yolk, when the parts are either of equal or of different
sizes, and produced at different intervals. The former
separate very soon and form separate individuals, which
therefore consist only of one element and represent the
lowest type (Protozoa); the ova of Matazoa, which are
unequally divided according to a certain law, remain
whole. Their coarser formation is brought about in a
purely mechanical way, each division causing a displace-

director of the Zoological Museum at Dresden. Like every

which this book is crammed. Indeed, he owns that he
was almoit of opinion that it was the author's intention to
write a satire on modern narratives of travel, and that on
the last page of the book the reader would be told of this;
"but, unfortunately, Capt. Lawson is constantly in earnest;
imUed, he left no stone unturned to make the book attractive
and to pass off its contents as real facts." Prof. Meyer dwells
at some length on Capt. Lawson's marvellous mountain ascents,
on his wonderful hunting feats, and his most surprising disco-

veries in the animal and vegetable world. He points out that

are not found further eastward than Java, monkeys not further
than Timor, and deer not further than I lalmahera, and that it
is incredible that these species, besides buffaloes, foxes, and
hares, [exist in New Guinea. Prof. Meyer, in conclusion,
thinks it rather surprising that shortly after the publication of
this wonderful book of fiction a deputation led by the Duke of
Manchester should have waited upon the Colonial Secretary with
a view to induce the Government to annex New Guinea. He asks,
"Was this a consequence of the marvellous description of the

RECENT PROGRESS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE
OF THE CI LI ATE INfUSORIA*

'"THE reproductive process was lately followed by myself
•*• through some of ils stages in a very beautiful Vorticellidan
obtained abundantly from a pond in Brittany, t The zooids which
form the colonies in this Infusorium are grouped in spherical
clusters on the extremities of the branches. They present near
the oral end a large and very obvious contractile vesicle, and
have a long cylindrical nucleus curved in the form of a horseshoe.
In the internal protoplasm are also imbedded scattered green
chlurophylloid granules. No trace of the so-called nucleolus was
present in any of the specimens examined.
Among the ordinary zooids there were usually some which had
become encysted in a very remarkable way, and without any
previous conjugation having been noticed. These encysted forms
were much larger than the others and had assumed a nearly
spherical shape ; the peristome and cilia-disc had become entirely
withdrawn, the contractile vesicle was still obvious, but had
ceased to manifest contractions; brownish spherical corpuscles

phylloid granules ol the uncncysted zooid, were scattered through
the parenchyma, and the nucleus was not only distinct, but had
increased considerably in length. Round the whole a clear
gelatinous envelope had become excreted.
In a later stage there was formed between the gelatinous enve-
lope and the cortical layer of the body a strong, dark-brown,
apparently chitinous case, the surface of which in stages still
further advanced had become ornamented by very regular hexa-
gonal spaces with slightly elevated edges. In this state the chi-
tinous envelope was so opaque that no view could be obtained
through it ot the included structures, and in order to arrive at any
knowledge of these it was necessary to rupture it. The nucleus
thus liberated was found to have still further increased in
length, and to have become wound into a convoluted and com-
plicated knot. Along with the nucleus were expelled multi-
tudes of very minute corpuscles with active Brow nian movements.
In a still further stage the nucleus had become irregularly
branched, and at the same time somewhat thicker and ot a
solter consistence ; and finally, it had become broken up into
spherical fragments, each with an included corpuscle resembling
a true cell nucleus in which the place of a nucleolus was taken
by a cluster of minute granules.
In this case the original nucleus of the Vorticellidan had thus
become broken up into bodies identical with the so-called eggs
of Balbiuni, but this was unaccompanied by any conjugation or
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
by the formation of anything which could be compared to
spennatozo.il filaments.
What I believe we may regard as now established in the
phenomena of reproduction in the Infusoria is, that besides the
ordinary reproduction by spontaneous fission of the entire body,
the nucleus at certain periods, and after more or less change of
form has occurred in the Infusorium body, becomes broken up
into fiagments, each including a corpuscle resembling a true ceil
nucleus ; and that this takes place without necessarily requiring
the influence ot conjugation or the action of spermatozoa; that
these Iragments after their liberation from the body of the In-
fusorum become developed—still without the necessity of sper-
matic influence—directly or indirectly into the adult form.
Whether proper sexual elements ever take pait in the life
history of the Infusoria remains an open question.
\ Everts % has given an account of observations which, with the
view of testing the statements ot Greeff, he made on Vorticella
nttulifera. Greeff, as we have seen, followed Claparede and
Lachmann in attributing to the Vorticella; a true ccelenterate
structure; and Everts, by his own investigations, has convinced
himself of the untenable ness of this view, and has been led to

to the investigation of the Infusoria, Haeckel must be mentioned
as the one who has brought the greatest amount of evidence to
bear on the question of their unicellularity. In a very elaborate
paper which has quite recently appeared,* and which is remark-
able for the clearness and logical acuteness with which the
whole subject is treated, Prof. Haeckel, resting mainly on the
observations of others, and partly also on his own, argues in favour
of the unicellularity of the Infusoria from the evidence afforded
both by the phenomena of their development and by the struc-
ture ot the mature organism. He confines himself chiefly to
the Ciliata—which, indeed, he regards as the only true Infu-
soria—while he considers the unicellularity of the Flagellata as
too obvious to require an elaborate defence. The value of this
paper will be obvious from the analysis of it which I now pro-
pose to give.
In stating the argument derived from development, Haeckel
does not accept as established the alleged' sexual reproduction of
the Infusoria, and he believes it safest to regard as non-sexual
"sporee" the bodies (fCeimkugfln) which result' from the break-
ing up of the nucleus, and which Balbiani regarded as eggs.
These bodies consist of a little mass of protoplasm usually

destitute of membrane, and including a nucleus within which
one or more refringent granules admitting of comparison with
a true nudeolus may sometimes be witnessed—cliaracters which
are all those of a simple genuine cell. From this spore the
embryo is developed by direct growth and differentiation ol
parts; but however great may be the differentiation, there is
never anything like the formation of a tissue.
The development of the Infusoria is thus entirely in favour of
the unicellular theory. This theory, however, is just as strong'y
supported by the study of their mature condition; and here
Haeckel gives an admirable exposition of the structure of the
true or Ciliate Infusoria.
The parts which are common to all Ciliata and which first
differentiate themselves in the ontogenesis or development of the
spore, are the cortical layer, the medullary parenchyma, and the
nucleus, which is situated on the boundary between the two.
The differentiation of the protoplasm of the naked spore into a
clearer and firmer cortical substance, and a more turbid, granular,
and softer medullary substance, corresponds entirely with what
we see in the parenchyma cells of higher animals. These two
products of differentiation are designated by Haeckel "exoplasm"
and " endoplasm."
The exoplasm is originally a perfectly homogeneous and struc-
tureless, colourless hyaline layer distinguishable from the turbid
granular soil protoplasm of the internal body mass, by containing

in its composition less \vater, by absence of included granules, and
by its high independent contractility. All the mobile appendages
ol ihe body, tue cilia, bristles, spine;, hairs, hooks, &c., are
nothing but structureless extensions of this exoplasm and partici-
pate in its contractility. In this respect ihey entirely correspond
to the cilia and lla^elltc of the cells which lorm the ciliated epi-
thelium ol muhicellular animals.
In many Ciliata we find this cortical layer or exoplasm itself
subsequently differentiated into distinct strata. In the most
highly differentiated Ciliata lour layers may be distinguished as
the result of til s secondary differentiation of the exoplasm.
These are: (l) the culic.e layer, (2) the cilia layer, (3) the
inyophan layer, (4) the trichocyst layer.
The cutide is nothing but a lifeless exudation from the surface.
In the majority of Ciliata there is no true cuticle, and in those
which possess it, it presents itself under various forms, as seen
in the thin, chitine-like, hyaline homogene jus pellicle of Para-
ma;cum and Trichodina, the outer elastic layer ol the stem ol the

dition than it was when we noticed its last Report, the tone of
which was almost despairing. The attendance has been very
much better, and the interest taken in the Society by the boys is
evidently increasing. Judging from the lists a fair amount of
field-work in natural history has been done, and the Society is
gradually forming good collections. But, as the preface to one
of the Reports hints, there is still much room for improvement in
the subjects and character of the papers read at the meetings.
Except in the case of lectures by outsiders, the majority of the
papers are the result of reading and not of observation or experi-
ment, and not many of them can strictly be called scientific.
Now, however useful such exercises as these may be to the boys,
this is scarcely the sort of work one looks for from members of a
Natural History Society. We think this Society might well take
a leaf out of the Rugby Society's Report, and go in much more
extensively for organised field-work, encouraging the boys to use
their eyes and their hands on nature as well as on books, and to

the other. And further, that any disturbance affecting the
column of stria; due to one current affects similarly, with refer-
ence to absolute space, that due to the other, so that the double
column moves, if at all, as a solid or elastic mass. And this
fact is the more remarkable if we consider, as is easily observed
in a revolving mirror, that these currents are alternate, not only
in direction, but also in time, and that no one of them is pro-
duced until after the complete extinction of its predecessor.
And it is also worthy of note that this association of stria; is not
destroyed, even when the two currents are separated more
or less towards opposite sides of the tube by the presence of a
magnetic pole. There seems, however, to be a tendency in that
case ior the striae of one current to advance upon the positions
occupied by those of the reverse current, giving the whole
column a twisted appearance. But as there is no trace, so far as
the author's observations go, of this association of alternate dis-
charges when produced by the ordinary break, we seem led to
the conclusion that a stratified discharge, on ceasing, leaves the
gas so distributed as to favour, during a very short interval of
time, a similar stratification on the occurrence of another dis-
charge, whether in the same or in the opposite direction. An

explanation of the fact that the stria; of alternate discharges
occupy alternate and not similar positions is not obvious, and
probably demands a better knowledge of the nature of the striae
than we possess at present.
The column of striae, which usually occupy a large part of the
tube from the positive towards the negative terminal, have
hitherto been described as stationary, except as disturbed by
irregularities of the break. The column is, however, frequently
susceptible of a general motion, or "flow," either from or
towards the positive pole, say a forward or backward flow. A
similar phenomenon was observed by Mr. Gassiot in some tubes
with his large battery, but the author is not acquainted with the
exact circumstances under which it was produced. This flow
may be controlled, both in velocity and in direction, by resist-
ance introduced into the circuit, or by placing the tube in a mag-
netic field. The resistance may be introduced in either the
primary or the secondary circuit. For the former arrangement
the author successfully employed a set ot resistance-coils, sup-
plemented by a rheostat. For the secondary current, as well as
lor the Holtz machine, he has used an instrument devised
and constructed by his assistant, Mr. P. Ward, to whose intelli-
gence and skill he is much indebted throughout this investiga-
tion, intended for fine adjustment. Wherever the resistance be
introduced the following law appears to be established by a
great number and variety of experiments, viz., that, the strioe
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
being previously stationary, an increase of resistance produces
a forward flow, a decrease of resistance a backward flow. The
author has generally found that a variation of 3 or 4 ohms,
or, under favourable conditions, of I or 2 ohms, is suffi-
cient to produce this effect. But as an alteration in the
current not only affects the discharge directly, but also reacts
upon the break, the effect is liable to be masked by these indirect
causes. The latter, so far as they are dependent upon a sudden
alteration of the resistance, may be diminished by the use of the
rheostat; but when the striae are sufficiently sensitive to admit
the use of this delicate adjustment, some precautions are neces-
sary to ensure perfect uniformity of current, so as to avoid dis-
turbances due to uneven contact in the rheostat itself.
When the stria; are flowing they preserve their mutual dis-
tances, and do not undergo increase or decrease in their numbers.
Usually one or two remain permanently attached to the positive
electrode; and as the moving column advances or recedes, the
foremost stria diminishes in brilliancy until, after travelling over
a distance less than the intervals between the two stria;, it is lost
in darkness. The reverse takes place at the rear of the column.

—On Prfrastomus sirtnoiJ.-s, Owen. (Part II.), by Prof. Owen,
F.R.S. The author has submitted the skull of a Sireniaii from
Jamaica, described by him in 1855 underthe name of Prorastomus
sircnoi/ifs, to a careful re-examination; and in this paper
notices the characters revealed by further removal of the matrix,
and discusses the bearings of the facts thus ascertained upon the
relations of the animal and of the Sirenia generally. The parts
which have been brought to light are the base and roof of the
cranium, the zygomatic arches, the hind half of the mandible,
with the articular part of the condyle, and the greater part of the
atlas. The characters presented by these parts are described in
detail, and the characters of the genus are compared with those
presented by other genera of Sirenians, both living and fossil,
especially Manalus and Fclsinotherium. The dental formula of
Prorastomus is given as—

pression or of individual excess of development as in existing

Sirenians. The presence of these small subequal incisorsin both
jaws of Prorastomus is the most marked feature in which Proras-
tomus adheres to the normal mammalian type, while showing
the essential characters of the marine Herbivores ; but a similar
tendency is shown in other parts of the skull. The author regards
the Sirenia as essentially monophyodont. Halicort and Fclsino-
therium depart further from the type than HalUherium and
Manatus, and these than Prorastomus. Khytina, with a better
developed brain and with the jaws edentulous when adult, is an
extreme modification of the Sirenian type. The rudimentary
femur in HalUherium is to be regarded as the result of degenera-
tion through lack of use, from better-limbed prototypal mammals.
With respect to the genealogy of the Sirenia, the author remarks
that Hackel derives the Sirenia, Zeuglodontes, and Cetacea, to-
gether with the Artiodactyla, from the branch Ungulata, and the
Perissodactyla from the branch Pycnoderma of the Mammalian
trunk; but that while UalMcrium and Felsiaothfrium show the
molar pattern of Hippopotamus, Prorastomus exhibits that of
LophioJon and Tapirus, to which Manatus also adheres rather than
to any Artiodactyle type. The author suggests that both Ungu-
lates and Sirenians diverged at some remote period from a more
generalised (cretaceous?) mammalian gyrencephalous type? and
that the marine Herbivora in the course of long Eocene and
Miocene eons were subjected to conditions producing modifica-
tions of their molars, leading on one side to an Artiodactyle and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
on the other to a Perissodactyle character. As Prorastomus by
its more generalised dentition and shape of brain represents a
step nearer the speculative starting-point than any other Sirenian,
it acquires a great interest, and the determination of the precise
age of the (supposed Eocene) bed from which its remains were
derived is very much to be desired.—On the structure of the
skull of Khizoi/iis, by L. C. Miall, F.G.S. In this paper the
author described a large skull of RlrizoJus from the coal-shale of
Gilmerton, near Edinburgh. The characters described show
that Khizotlus is a Ganoid fish, and that its position in the
order is not far from Holoptychiui and Megalichthys. The
author referred it to the cycloidal division of the family Glypto-
dipterini.—Appendix to a note on a modified form of Dinosaurian

•ir, it is evi.lent that the barometric rise takes place under an
uptake of air. If we consider further that a light ascensional
current would give rise simply to an overcast sky, a stronger one
to rain, while a still more violent one would project the air
sudJenly into a region so cold and dry that the resulting elec-
tricity would be discharged disruptively as lightning, the fore-
going observations show that the greatest rise is under the
greatest uptake. Some meteorologists attribute the low pres-
sure at the equator to the ascending current formed at the junc-
tion of the trades ; while others attribute the 10 A.M. maximum
of the diurnal range of the barometer to the reaction of an
ascending column of air due to the increasing heat of the day.
The above observations tend to strengthen the view that an
ascending column of air gives rise to a reactionary pressure
downwards, and more generally to the idea that though the
total pressure shown by the barometer is principally statical, or
due to the weight of a definite column of air, a small portion is
dynamical, or due to the reaction of air motion in that column.

SIR WILLIAM EDMOND LOGAN
BY the death of this illustrious geologist and most
genial man, science has been deprived of one of her
bravest and best soldiers, while those who personally
knew him have lost a true, warm-hearted friend.
One by one the magnates by whose toil geology rose
during the first half of this century are taken from us.
Link afterlink is broken in the chain of living men who have
served to bind us personally with the birth and infancy of
that science. Few were left to us, and of these few none
more honoured and beloved than the veteran who has just
been called away. Of Scottish parentage (his father
having been a landed gentleman in Stirlingshire, who
had emigrated to Canada), W. E. Logan was born at
Montreal in the year 1798. He was sent home to the old
country for his education, and studied, it is believed, both
at the High School and the University of Edinburgh.
Eventually, having developed an ardent love for geo-
logical pursuits, he settled in South Wales and began to
study the structure of the great coal-field of that region.
It was there that he fostered that habit of patient and

exact observation, combined with quickness of eye in
seizing the salient points in the geological structure of a
region, which stood him in such good stead in later life.
During a series of years he carefully followed the outcrops
of the various coal-seams, tracing the positions of the nume-
rous faults by which they are traversed, and putting all
his data upon the one-inch sheet of the Ordnance Survey.
These maps of the South Welsh coal-field were probably
the first in this country, on so large a scale and of so
extensive a district, where the details of geological struc-
ture were depicted with such minuteness. They were
generously handed over to Sir Henry de la Beche when
he began the Geological Survey in that region, and he
found them so admirable that he adopted them for the
Government Survey, on the early sheets of which the
name of W. E. Logan is engraved in conjunction with
those of De la Bcche, Ramsay, Phillips, and Aveline.
He worked on the staff oi the Survey as an enthusiastic
volunteer, lending invaluable assistance in the South
Welsh region, and among other services introducing
horizontal sections on a true scale of six inches to a mile,
which served as models for the large sections of the Survey.
One of the most important observations made by Logan
during this early part of his career was one relating to the
origin of coal. He pointed out, what is now so universally
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
recognised and yet does not seem ever to have struck
anybody before, that each coal-seam rests upon an under-
clay or fireclay in which rootlets of Stigmaria branch
freely in all directions. This association of coal and
Stiftnaria-clny he found to be so general that it could not
be regarded as accidental. He suggested that the clay
represented an ancient soil or mud in which the Stigmaria
grew, and that the coal stood now in place of the matted
vegetation which grew upon that soil. The value of this
contribution to our knowledge of the history of coal and
of the changes in physical geography to which the strati-
fied rocks bear witness, can hardly be over-estimated.
In the summer of 1841 Mr. Logan went to America and
VOL. xn.—No. 296
spent the autumn of that year in explorations of the coal-
fields there. He examined the Pennsylvanian region,
which had been studied by Rogers, and afterwards went
through the coal-districts of Nova Scotia, where he made
some original observations. He spent the winter of 1841-
1842 in Canada, devoting himself among other things to
watching the behaviour of ice as a great geological agent

But his difficulties lay not only in official quarters. He
had to go forth into the forest and ascend unvisited
rivers without a track or a map. He had to make his
own map as he went along, camping out with Indian
attendants for months together, and forcing his way as a
true pioneer of civilisation, through solitudes which in a
few years later were to become sceres of active industry.
Through all such hardships he carried a devotion which
not only brought him cheerily to the end of them, but
inspired his officers with much of his own energy in the
common cause. And not his own small^staff merely, but
farmers, country doctors, and settlers of all kinds whom
he enlisted into his service for such work as he found
them able and willing to undertake. He used, for in-
stance, to describe graphically and with much quiet
humour how in this way he got a number of utterly un-
scientific colonists to aid in tracing a band of limestone
through a district where no rock could be seen for the
covering of soil and drift. He provided them each with
a long iron-pointed stick and an acid-bottle, and instructed
them to thrust the stick well down through the soil till

they struck it against the solid rock underneath. There-
upon, pulling it out, they were to apply a drop of acid to
the bruised grains of stone adhering to the point of the
stick. If they saw a brisk effervescence, they were to
mark the place as lying on limestone.
The organisation of the Canadian Geological Survey
was admirably adapted for the work to be done, and shows
Sir William's skill as an administrator. Directing the
whole operations himself, working personally in the field
at original observation as well as visiting and superin-
tending the field-work of his staff, he had to get the ut-
most amount of work done for the smallest amount of
money. He secured some excellent assistants in the
field-work, whose names have long been familiar to geolo-
gists—Alexander Murray, now ably directing the New-
foundland Survey, James Richardson, and, in later years,
Robert Bell and others. He early saw that the field-work
required to be aided in two important directions—mine-
ralogical and chemical analysis, and palsontological
determination. Accordingly, he obtained for the former
subject the services of Dr. Sterry Hunt, whose reports on
Canadian rocks and minerals and contributions to che-
mical geology have since become so well known; while
for the latter he fortunately found and retained Mr.
Billings, who has done such good work among the inver-

tebrate fauna of the older palaeozoic rocks of British
North America. Ever ready himself to give information
and assistance, he everywhere solicited and obtained it
from others for the advancement of the Survey.
Of the benefits which the Survey has conferred on
Canada, perhaps the best proof is furnished by the firm
footing and comparatively liberal equipment which it has
now obtained from the Provincial Legislature. The Sur-
vey has opened up in a systematic and trustworthy way
the mineral structure and resources of the colony. It has
formed a museum and laboratory in which the minerals,
rocks, and fossils of the country are examined and illus-
trated with special reference to the industrial develop-
ment of the country. It has been the means of creating
reliable topographical maps over wide regions which had
not previously been depicted on any map.
It would take longer to enumerate the many services
which Sir William Logan's Survey has rendered to Geo-
logy. Foremost among them we should probably place
the great additions which it has made to our knowledge
of the stratigraphy of the older formations. The exist-

Canada after he-had been knighted. He was, of course,
expected to say something of himself and of his visit to

long pointer, turned round to some maps and diagrams
illustrative of the geology of Canada, and only recovered
his peace of mind and command of language when he
found himself once more among Laurentian, Huronian,
gneiss, limestone, and the rest of his beloved rocks.
Nevertheless, he kept copious journals of his various
expeditions, and illustrated them with most admirable
pen-and-ink sketches. A selection from these could
hardly fail to be of great interest, both in relation to the
man himself and to the way in which geology has to be
carried on amid the wild life of the backwoods.

TREVANDRUM MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS
Observations of Magnetic Declination made at Trevan-

Highness the Maharajah of Travancore, G.C.S.I., in
the Years 1852 to 1869. Vol. i. Discussed and edited
by John Allan Broun, F.R.S., late Director of the
Observatories. (London: Henry S. King and Co.)
WE have heard a great deal lately about the native
rulers of India, and the worst features of one of
them have been brought very prominently before us; but
it|is a pleasing reflection that they are not all like the poten-
tate of Baroda, while some of them might even read a
lesson to the paramount power. Let us hear what Mr. J.
Allan Broun, a magnetician of great eminence, has to say
of the late ruler of Travancore.
"The Trevandrum Observatory," he tells us, " owed its
origin in 1836 to the enlightened views of his Highness
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Rama Vurmah, the reigning Rajah of Travancore, and to
the encouragement given to them by the late General
Stuart Fraser, then representing the British Government
at Trevandrum. His Highness, desirous that his country
should partake with European nations in scientific inves-
tigations, sanctioned the construction of an observatory,
named Mr. Caldecott its director, and gave him power to
furnish it with the best instruments to be obtained in
Europe."
The peculiar position of Trevandrum, not far from the
magnetic equator, induced Mr. Caldecott, with the Rajah's
permission, to procure from Europe a complete equipment
of the best instruments for magnetic and meteorological
observations, and to build a magnetic observatory, which
was completed in 1841.
Mr. Caldecott died at Trevandrum in 1849, arul the
observatory was in January 1852 placed under the direc-
tion of Mr. John Allan Broun, who had previously directed
with well-known success the observatory of Sir T. Bris-
bane at Makerstoun, in Scotland.
Mr. Broun began his office with the conception of an

compared together, and the result of all these comparisons
tends to impress the reader with the fact that we have in
this volume a series of observations of the magnetic decli-
nation of a thoroughly accurate and trustworthy nature.
The following passage from Mr. Broun's magnetic
diary may be quoted as exhibiting the sources of error to
which magneticians are exposed, as well as the care be-
stowed in avoiding them—
"1855, Dec. 4d. gh. A sudden vibration of Grubb's "mag-
net through thirty scale divisions was observed, and the
difference of Adie's and Grubb's instruments, which had
previously been — o'-o5, became suddenly + 3''5o. It was
supposed that either the suspension thread was breaking,
or that a spider had got within the box.
"Dec. 4d. 22h. The boxes were removed, and an
exceedingly small spider was discovered and removed.
This was the only occasion in which a spider succeeded
in entering Grubb's declinometer boxes between 1852
and 1870. Every care was taken when the boxes were
removed, before replacing them, to hold them for some
time over the flame of a lamp, so that spiders, even invi-

sible to the naked eye, must have been dislodged or
destroyed."
It remains now to give our readers a summary of the
most important results obtained by Mr. Broun from the
reduction of his observations.
In the first place, the secular 'variation is found to be
irregular, but the observations seem to indicate that after
a certain interval the acceleration or retardation of the
secular movement has equal values. This interval is
estimated at lo-5 years. In order to find the annual
period, the variations which form the secular and decen-
nial inequalities have been eliminated. The observations
then indicate a twofold inequality, one of which corre-
sponds to a single oscillation in a year, with a minimum
in March or April, and a maximum in September or
October, while the other represents a double or semi-
annual oscillation with maxima in March and September.
Mr. Broun was also led to suspect a periodo/'forty-four
months, which was repeated four times successively in
his observations, although no cause is known which
could produce an inequality of this duration.
The next inequality noticed is the twenty-six day period,
which Mr. Broun is inclined to attribute to solar action
with more confidence than the longer period of ten or
eleven years. Our readers will remember that the period
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
was re-discovered by Dr. Hornstein, director of the
Prague Observatory. Mr. Broun thinks that there are
traces of a double oscillation of the twenty-six day period.
Coming next to the important solar diurnal variation,
the chief features of which are tolerably well known, Mr.
Broun finds this to consist of one marked maximum and
one marked minimum of easterly declination in each
month of the year, and of one or more secondary maxima
and minima.
The principal maximum occurs in the six months of
April to September at about 7 A.'M., and the principal
minimum about twenty minutes past noon in the same
months. Nearly the inverse of this happens in the four
months of November to February. The results obtained
by Mr. Broun appear to him to indicate the action
of opposite forces belonging to the two hemispheres,
which mainly destroy each other in March and October
at Trevandrum, but one of which is preponderant in
the other months of the year; and of these forces he
remarks that those of the northern hemisphere seem to
have a greater effect on the variations of the whole globe

and to discuss those by themselves, and the result has
been the most interesting and important discovery of the
law of storms. And if it be asked what right meteoro-
logists had to separate a body of disturbed observations,
the reply will obviously be that they are justified by their
success. Deny the right, and a cyclone becomes an
altogether false and illegitimate scientific conception.
Now, a large and increasing number of magneticians
are of opinion that the phenomena of terrestrial mag-
netism can bear a similar treatment. They believe that
the sun has a daily and yearly influence on the magnetism
of the earth just as it has upon its meteorology, and they
also believe that it is the cause—the indirect cause, it
maybe—of an abnormal magnetic influence, just as in
meteorology it is the indirect cause of the cyclone.
Some even go so far as to say that these two abnormal
influences, the one in magnetism, the other in meteoro-
logy, are intimately connected together. This assertion,
however, is not now the point in question. The point is
that we have in magnetism certain abnormal distur-
bances which may be compared to abnormal meteoro-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
logical disturbances. Now, it is held by Sir E. Sabine
and those who share his views, that it is expedient to
separate out these disturbed magnetical observations, just
as we' separate out the meteorology of a cyclone. This
school assert that we may thus arrive at a series of pheno-
mena obeying very different laws from those of the un-
disturbed observations, and that we are therefore justified
in making the separation, inasmuch as we are thereby
led to a clearer knowledge of the various ways in which
the sun affects the magnetism of the earth. And they
insist very strongly upon the point that both these mag-
netic actions of the sun have diurnal and annual varia-
tions different from one another, so that if treated to-
gether we obtain a result much more complex than if they
be treated separately.
We have little doubt of the policy of this method of
treatment, and we cannot, therefore, but regard it as a
misfortune that Mr. Broun has not unmistakably adopted
it. He has, however, given us all the individual obser-
vations, so that, if it be thought desirable, those magne-
ticians who advocate a somewhat different method of
reduction may make it for themselves. We need only add,
in conclusion, that the appendices will be found to be
very interesting reading, and that all who are interested
in terrestrial physics must look with great interest to that

object, the author tells us, is to teach a few of the simpler
facts in acoustics in such a way that the learner shall not
be deterred by unnecessary difficulties, either in the use
of technical language or in having to provide expensive
apparatus. Most successfully has the author attained the
end he had in view. It is just what a child's book on
science should be. Written in a simple attractive man-
ner, without any silly childishness, it conveys a great deal
of information, and that in the best kind of way. For
the learner, by a series of simple experiments, is made to
lay firmly the groundwork of his knowledge on this sub-
ject. All the apparatus the author requires is a toy fiddle,
one or two small tuning-forks, a couple of finger-glasses,

less weight to them than to the former readings. My exhaustion
was doubtless partly due to hunger, for I purposely fasted in
order to test the correctness of Lortet's statement that the fall in
temperature is specially marked during an ascent made when
hungry.
These observations were all I could obtain, as I was too much
fatigued to carry on the work. They are scarcely numerous
enough to enable any very definite conclusions to be drawn ; but

so far as they ge, they certainly are not confirmatory of the con-
clusions arrived at by Drs. Marcet and Lortet; they at least
prove that if any decrement does occur during climbing, it is
never so great as 8° (Lortet), or even as much as 3° (Marcet).
It may be thought that the low readings obtained in the later
observations on first placing the thermometer in the mouth, are
indicative of a decrease in body-temperature. It must be borne
in mind, however, that, especially in the later observations, we
were facing a keen wind sweeping down a mountain partially
covered with snow ; it is perfectly obvious from this cause that
the first minute's observations can afford no reliable indication
of the temperature of the mouth, or otherwise the body must
recover its normal temperature with a rapidity which would be
perfectly extraordinary. From repeated trials made on myself
and others, I have come to the conclusion that observations of
the temperature of the mouth taken even after the end of the
second minute give no trustworthy indication of the temperature
of the body ; such indications are of no value even as compara-
tive measurements.
As it seems quite certain that any variation which may occur
is. a matter of tenths and not of whole degrees, it may be
well to point out a source of error in the method of observation
which seems to have escaped the attention of observers hitherto,
but which in any case is too considerable to be neglected,
although it would specially affect the results obtained at high

altitudes. In taking the temperature of the mouth on a moun-
tain, surrounded by a rapidly moving atmosphere at a tempera-
ture often but little higher than that ot melting snow, it is obvious
that the mean temperature of the mercurial column must be
considerably lower than that of the mouth, since the greater
portion of the stem is in the cold air. The correction to be
added to the readings is readily calculated if we know the
length of the exposed column, its mean temperature, and the
apparent expansion of mercury in glass. If we suppose the
length of the exposed column in the observation taken at
2.30 P.M. to be forty times the length of a degree, and its mean
temperature that of melting snow, the correction to be added
to the last reading would amount to a quarter of a degree.
The whole subject unquestionably merits reinvestigation. A
much larger number of observations is needed; these should be
made under similar circumstances on different persons, for it
may well happen that the bodily idiosyncrasy of the individual
may affect the result. Possibly some Alpine party may under-
take the solution of the problem during the present season. It
is doubtless not so simple as it may at tirst sight appear. From

South American Earthquakes
On the iSth May, that is, the same clay that, if the telegraphic
news be correct, the cities of Cucuta, Santiago, and others
were destroyed by an earthquake, a distinct and prolonged
shock, preceded and accompanied by a loud rumbling noise,
awoke the greater number of the inhabitants of this place, about
.1 quarter of an hour before midnight. The direction of the
phenomenon was thought by some who heard and felt it to
be from east to west; t>ut this opinion was, I have reason to
believe, inaccurate.
Not knowing as yet the exact time at which the Columbian
disaster took place, I am unable to calculate the'rate at which
the shock, connected with, one can hardly doubt, the great
earthquake above alluded to, may have travelled the long dis-
tance that separates St. Thomas from Cucuta. Fuller details
may subsequently, I hope, help to elucidate the matter.
It is worthy ol note that whereas before the 18th May an
unusually long period had elapsed during which no subterraneous
vibrations had been felt in this island, there have occurred since
that date several slight shocks at various hours of the day and
night, with 0 frequency above the average.

Glacier and other Ice
The reviewer of Croll's "Climate and Time" in Nature of
the 24th June (p. 144) says: "What is there in this (Mr. Croll's)
theory to distinguish a glacier from a common piece of ice?
which on this principle ought to flatten out and not retain its
shape as it does."
I believe that, independently of any theory of the cause of
glacier motion, there is no physical difference whatever between
glacier and other ice. The greater mobility of a glacier is
merely due to its greater size and weight; just as water in a river-
bed flows with very little friction, under a pressure that would
not make it flow at all in a capillary tube. The plasticity of ice
may however be shown on a small scale. I have read some-
where that a slab of ice supported only on its two ends will
gradually bend down in the middle: and I have seen Prof. James
Thomson at the Belfast Museum illustrate a lecture by moulding
a few lumps of ice by pressure into the shape of a cup.
I am not writing in defence of Mr. Croll's theory of glacier
motion. I believe the best explanation of those physical
properties of ice on which glacier-motion depends is that given
by I'rof. James Thomson. I know Mr. Croll's theory only
from your review, and I do not know how far it agrees with
I'rof. Thomson's. JoSEl'H JOHN MURPHY

"Harrovian's" query in vol. xii. p. 126, as to the mortality
amongst the house-fly, and the yellow powder which covered
the carcase. I have noticed myself that house-flies often die
in numerous company. I had an idea that it was owing to
the temperature falling to its benumbing point, until I found the
same thing happening while the thermometer was particularly
high. Then I thought that all these dead flies might belong to
the same brood, and having lived under almost exactly the same
circumstances, their threads of life were spun out at almost
exactly the same time. '1 his new theory, again, did not stand

the year 1857 and the next period of the comet's visi-
bility, so that by Leveau's calculations for that epoch the
time of revolution had been increased sixty-eight days,
the inclination diminished more than two degrees, with
very material changes in the other elements. If we adopt

with the atomic weight gave a constant value, or, in other
words, the atoms of all the elements experimented with
have the same capacity for heat The investigation of
Regnault confirmed this law, showing that it is valid for
most of the solid elements with tolerable exactness ; but it
should be remembered here that the specific heats of these
elements must be determined at temperatures which are
sufficiently below the melting points of the elements
in question. Only carbon, boron, and silicon proved
exceptions to this remarkably simple, natural law ; for
these three elements far smaller atomic heats were found.
It was also found that the different allotropic modifications
of these three elements possess quite different specific
heats, and that none of these specific heats were in
accordance with Dulong and Petit's law. Later on
similar results were obtained by De la Rive and Marcct,
Wiillner and Bettendorf. We must not forget to men-
tion, for the sake of completeness, that with regard to the
difference in the specific heats of the allotropic modifica-
tions of an element, Kopp has already, in 1864, stated
his belief that all allotropic modifications of each element

possess the same specific heat in all cases, and that the
results of experiments which are contradictory to this view
must be considered as caused either by a faulty method of
observation or else by impurities in the substances used.
Herr Weber of Hohenheim has succeeded lately in prov-
ing the validity of Dulong- Petit's law, also for carbon, boron,
and silicon; his experiments were made with Bunsen's
ice-calorimeter. In order to heat the substances experi-
mented upon to a series of temperatures below red heat,
oil baths were used, and various temperatures between
o° and 300° C. were applied; in order to cool them,
solid carbonic acid and a cold mixture, consisting
of one part of snow and J part of common salt, were
employed. All these temperatures were read off directly
from an ordinary air-thermometer. For higher tempera-
tures (between 500° and 1000°) an indirect method was
made use of, which allowed of the determination of the
temperatures by means of the indications of the calori-
meter. This indirect method is based on the correctness
of Pouillet's determinations (published in 1836) of the
quantity of heat which a certain unity of weight of
platinum requires to become heated from temperature
T0 to T. (These determinations arc given by Pouillet for
the interval T = o° to T = 1200° C.) The results which
Hcrr Weber obtained may be stated as follows :— The

specific heats of carbon, boron, and silicon increase
regularly as the temperature rises, from the lowest
obtainable degrees of temperatures upwards, and finally
remain nearly constant after a certain degree has been
reached. The nature of the function, which expresses the
dependence of the specified heat y from the temperature
T, seems to bo the same for all the three elements, and to
possess the following formula :—
where A, B, q and /z express constant positive values, and

wards from the absolute zero.
The temperature from which the specific heat of
carbon remains nearly constant is somewhere near 600°
C., and it is immaterial whether the carbon is in the
form of diamond or in that of graphite. From red heat
upwards this element shows no greater variability in its
specific heat than the other elements which follow Dulong-
Petit's law. (At lower temperatures, however, for in-
stance when the temperature rises from - 50° C. to
+ 600°, its specific heat increases sevenfold). The

By uniting two or more machines to-
gether, electrical currents of high tension
may be obtained. But a more useful
arrangement is to divide into two each
ring, so that the two halves may be joined
either for quantity or tension, and varied
effects thus obtained from the same ma-
chine. This is effected in the following
manner. Suppose the machine to contain
sixty bobbins or helices round the ring.
If the entrance of the thirty alternate
bobbins is placed on one side of the ring
and of the thirty other bobbins on the
other side, there will be in reality two
ring-armatures in one, interlaced as it
were into each other; and by collecting
the currents by means of two systems of
rubbers, one to the right and the other to
the left of the ring, we may obtain from
each one half of the electricity produced
by the rotation of the ring. By applying

this principle to machines for producing
the electric light, the same machine may
give two distinct lights instead of one.
In its industrial applications, this is a
point of capital importance. The use of
the electric light is at present greatly in-
terfered with by its excessive brightness,
and the deep shadows which by contrast
are produced at the same time. These
defects will be to a large extent remedied
by the use of two lights, so that the
shadow from one may be illuminated by
the other. It is proposed to use four
electric lights, each of the strength of tilty
Carcel burners, for lighting foundries and
large workshops. In support of this pro-
posal 1 may remark that I find Duboscq's
lamp of the latest construction gives a
singularly steady and mild light, with
only twenty Bunsen's cells, and would of
course work equally well with currents of
the same intensity from a magneto-elec-
tric machine.

proposed improvements in magneto-elec-
tric machines, which will be found in the
records of the Patent Office during the
last three years. I cannot, however, pass
over without notice the machine of Sie-
mens and Alteneck, in which electrical
currents are obtained solely by the rota-
tion of a longitudinal helix of insulated
wire. This helix revolves in an annular
space bounded externally by two semi-
cylindiical magnetic poles, and internally
by a stationary cylinder of iron, which
latter may also be an independent mag-
net. The following account of this appa-
ratus I give nearly in the words of the
inventors. Between the poles of one or
more magnets or electro-magnets, an iron
core or cylinder is placed so as to leave a
space between it and the faces of the
magnetic poles, which have a cylindrical
form, and are concentric with the iron

connected by metallic rollers or brushes with two sta-
tionary conductors, which are insulated, and constitute
the poles of the machine. The currents obtained on
rotating the shell may be made either continuous or
intermittent, or they may be alternately reversed. The
iron cylinder itself may be rendered magnetic by coiling
upon it longitudinally an insulated wire after the manner
of the rotating armature of Siemens.
To enumerate the possible applications of induction
machines would be simply to describe all the applica-
tions which have already been made, or may hereafter
be made, of current electricity to useful purposes. Among
the former, the electric telegraph, the electric light, and
electro-plating are perhaps the most important; among
the latter, it will be sufficient to mention two proposals,
one to facilitate the ascent of steep gradients by in-
creasing, by means of magnetism, the adhesion of the
wheels of locomotives to the iron rails; the other, to
decompose, by electrolysis, common salt so as to obtain
directly, and in a state of purity, the valuable chemical
products hydrochloric acid and soda.

THE GOVERNMENT ECLIPSE EXPEDITION
TO SIAM
THE following few details concerning the above Expe-
dition will probably be of interest to the readers of
NATURE; having just returned from Siam, I am unable
at present to give full particulars. The general results
obtained by our party have already been published in
this country by means of the telegraph. The fact that
any results were obtained at all is far more than might
have been expected considering the very brief time we
had to adjust the instruments. We had only five days to
land, unpack, fit up, and test the instruments, most ot
which were quite new and untried. This want of time
was in the first place owing to unavoidable delays on the
way out, and to the fact that there was no steamer ready
to take us on to the Observatory Camp at once, thus neces-
sitating a visit to Bangkok prior to the eclipse. Our partial
success is in a large measure due to the valuable assistance
of Capt. A. J. Loftus, an English gentleman in the service
of his Majesty the King of Siam; Capt. Loftus was sent
out by his Majesty to prepare the camp for us at Choulai
Point.
As previous to our departure from London there appeared
in one of the leading journals a letter, signed "Monitor,"
in which some very unpleasant statements were made

with regard to the probable reception our party would
receive in Siam—although Mr. D. K. Mason, the Siamese
Consul in London, published at the time a total denial of
the absurd insinuations—I feel it my duty, in the name of
all who took part in the expedition, to state that during
our prolonged stay in the kingdom of Siam we received
nothing but the greatest hospitality and kindness. Every-
body, from the King downwards, showed the greatest
desire to make our visit as pleasant as possible, and to
aid the expedition in every way; difficulties were sur-
mounted at great expense and trouble, and everything we
asked for was at hand or was obtained with the least
possible delay. Our drinking-water was brought nearly
100 miles by water to the camp; many tons of ice were
brought up from Singapore, and every kind of wine was
ready at hand.

and Siamese, to assist us, and ordered such observations

that uniform temperature occupying the bottom of the ocean
trough of the enormous thickness of 3,075 fathoms (18,450 feet).
The observations made in this section, taken in connection with
others made elsewhere, would seem to point to the following
law:—That "Globigerina ooze"—a rapidly forming deposit,
containing the whole of the abundant carbonate of lime of the
shells of the Foraminifera living on the surface and beneath it,
and consequently consisting of almost pure carbonate of lime—
generally occupies depths under 2,000 fathoms in the ocean;
that beyond this depth, the proportion of the calcareous matter
is gradually diminished, and the deposit, which now contains a
considerable amount of clay, goes under the name of grey ooze;
that at 2,600 fathoms the calcareous matter has almost entirely
disappeared, and we have the purest iorm of "red clay," a sili-
cate of alumina and iron with siliceous tests of animals; that
from this point the "clay" decreases in proportion, and the
siliceous shells increase, until at extreme depths the "clay" is
represented by little more than a red cement, binding the shells
together. As to the transition from the "Globigerina ooze" to
the "red clay," the Times correspondent says, it k due to the

removal of the lime of the Globigerina shells by water and car-
bonic acid, or in some other way; the apparent disappearance
of the "red clay " is a fallacy produced by the increased propor-
tion of the siliceous shells. It has now been ascertained by the
use of the tow-net at great depths that Radiolarians and Diatoms
inhabit the water all the way down, and are probably more
abundant at greater depths ; and it follows from this that four
times more, at least, must die and shed their tests in 4,000
fathoms than in 1,000 fathoms. The most marked temperature
phenomenon observed in the two sections was the presence of a
surface layer of water of an average depth of 80 fathoms, and a
temperature above 77° F., extending northwards from the coast
of New Guinea about 20°, and westward as far as the meridian
of the I'cllew Islands. The greater part of this huge mass of
warm water is moving with more or less rapidity to the west-
ward.

which are known in other undoubted cell-nuclei, as, for example,
in the germinal vesicle of many animals, in the nuclei of many
unicellular plants, the nuclei of many parenchyma cells of the
higher plants, and the nuclei of many nerve-cells. The mature
Infusorium nucleus is often vesicle-like, and consists of a delicate
investing membrane and fine granular contents, precisely as in
the differentiated nucleus of many other cells. In many Ciliata,
if not in all, there is within the young nucleus a dark, more
refringent corpuscle, which has quite the same relations as the
nucleolus of a true cell-nucleus.
Regarded from a physiological, no less than from a morpho-
logical point of view, the Infusorium nucleus and true cell
nucleus admit of a close comparison with one another. It may
be considered as established by the concurrent observations of all
investigators, that the nucleus of the Infusoria performs the
function of a reproductive organ, though the opinions entertained
as to the mode in which it thus acts are extremely divergent.
It is now admitted that in the reproduction of unicellular
organisms both in the animal and vegetable kingdom, the
nucleus takes an important part, and by its division as a primary
act ushers in the division of the rest of ihe protoplasm. Even in
the cells which form constituents of tissues, the part played by

the nucleus is altogether similar, its division always preceding
the division of the cell itself.
In quite a similar way does the nucleus behave in the ciliate
Infusoria. The non-sexual reproduction of the Infusoria by
division is perhaps universal. In such cases the division always
Iwfiins by the spontaneous halving of the nucleus, and this is
followed by a similar division of the surrounding protoplasm,
exactly as in the ordinary simple cell.
Another phenomenon m which the nucleus plays an impor'ant
part is named by Haeckel "spore formation." Under this
designation he comprehends all those cases in which—the idea
of a previous fecundation being rejected—the nucleus breaks
into numerous pieces, and each of these, apparently by becoming
encysted in a portion of the protoplasm of the mother body,
shapes itself into an independent cell—a so-called germ-globule,
(Kcimkugel). Now this is a true spore—just as much so as the
spores which arise quite in the same way in unicellular plants.
Tlic whole process is to be regarded as a case of the so-called
endogenous multiplication of cells.
Most authors, however, take a different view of the nucleus.
Following Balbiani, they regard it as an ovary ; and to the frag-
ments into which it breaks up they assign the significance of
C6SS! while the so-called nucleolus, wnich lies outside the
nucleus, is, as we have seen, believed to be a testis in which
spermatozoa are developed for the fecundation of the eggs.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
We must bear in mind, however, that this "nucleolus " has
been hiiherto found in but a disproportionately small number of
species, while the spermatozoal nature of the apparent filaments
which have been noticed in it has by no means been proved;
and we have already seen that some observed facts such as those
adduced by liiitschli arc opposed to the view which would assign
to them the nature of true spermatozoa.
As llaeckel remarks, however, even though the so-called
nucleolus be really a testis fecundating the eggs or fragments
derived from the breaking up of the nucleus, this would afford
no valid argument against the unicellularity of the Infusoria, for
precisely the fame sexual differentiation and reproduction arc
found in unicellular plants.
It may now, then, be regarded as proved that the process by
which the body of the ciliate Infusorium attains a cettain degree
of differentiation is repeated not only in other unicellular orga-
nisms, but in many parenchyma cells both of plants and animals.
The difference, as Haeckel with much force points out, between
the differentiation process of these parenchyma cells and that of
the Infusoiium body consists in the fact that in the parenchyma
cells the differentiation is a one-sided one, conditioned by the

table kingdom, these, too, would be referred without hesitation
either to the one or to the other, some passing to the former and
others to the latter. The group of the Protista is thus at beit
but a provisional one, based partly on our ignorance of the struc-
ture and life-history of the beings which compose it, and partly
on our inability to assign to the animal its essential difference
from the plant. Haeckel, however, has done well in specially
directing attention to it, and In his admirable researches on many
of the organisms which he has thus grouped together he has
largely contributed to our knowledge of living forms.
I have thus dwelt at considerable length upon this important
paper of Haeckel's, because I think that it not only brings out in
a clear light the essential features of infusorial structure and
physiology as demonstrated by recent research, but that it goes
far to set at rest the controversy regarding the unicellularity and
multicellularity of the Infusoria.
lialbiani has quite recently published a. very interesting account
of the remarkable Infusorium long ago described by O. F.
Miiller under the name of Vortictlla nassuta, and more recently
taken by Stein as the type of his genus Didinium.
The animal, which is somewhat barrel-shaped, with an anterior

and a posterior wreath of cilia, has one end continued into a
proboscis-like projection which carries the oral orifice on its
summit, while an anal orifice is situated on the point diametri-
cally opposite to this. There is a very distinct cuticle, though
the rest of the cortical layer is very thin, and can scarcely be
optically distinguished from the internal parenchyma, which
exhibits manifest currents of rotation. These flow in a con-
tinuous sheet along the walls from the anal towards the oral side,
and on arriving at the mouth turn in towards the axis and then
flow backwards along this until they complete the circuit by once
morel reaching the anal side of the body. No trichocysts are
developed in the walls of the body. The contractile vesicle is
large, and is situated near the anal end; it presents very distinct
pulsations, and Balbiani is disposed to believe in a communica-
tion between it and the exterior.
During the act of digestion a tubular cavity can be seen run-
ning through the axis of the body, and connecting the oral and
anal orifices. This is regarded by Balbiani as a permanent diges-
tive canal. The post-oral or pharyngeal portion of this tube
possesses a very remarkable feature, namely, a longitudinal
striation caused by rigid rod-like filaments which are developed
in its walls, and which can be easily detached and isolated by pres-
sure or by the action of acetic acid. They then resemble some
common forms of the raphides developed in the cells of plants.
The function of these rods becomes apparent when the animal is

observed in the act of capturing its prey. The Didinium is
eminently voracious and carnivorous, and when in pursuit of
other living Infusoria, such as Paramecium, the prey may be
seen to become suddenly paralysed on its approach. A careful
examination will then show that the Didinium has projected
against it some of its pharyngeal rods, and to the action of these
bodies the arrest of motion is attributed. A curious cylindrical
tongue-like organ is now projected from the mouth towards the
arrested prey, to which it becomes attached by its extremity. By
the retraction of this tongue the prey is now gradually with-
drawn towards the mouth, engulphed in the distended pharynx,
and pushed deeper and deeper into the axial canal, where it is
digested, and the effete matter ultimately expelled through the
anus.
From all this Balbiani concludes against the unicellular doc-
trine. He sees in the axial cavity a permanent alimentary canal,
and in the surrounding parenchyma a true perigastric space filled
with a liquid which corresponds with the perigastric liquid of
the polyzoa and of many other lower animals. He is not, how-
ever, disposed to make too broad a generalisation, and to insist
on the presence of an alimentary canal distinct from a body

Physical Society, June 26.—Prof. G. C. Foster, vice-presi-
dent, in the chair.—Mr. \V. J. Wilson read a paper on a method
of measuring electrical resistance of liquids. Great difficulty has
hitherto been experienced in measuring the resistance of electro-
lytes on account of the polarisation of the electrodes, and most
of the methods hitherto employed have aimed at reducing this
to a minimum by using large electrodes and very weak or rapidly
alternating currents. The determinations, however, are difficult
and require to be quickly performed. The following method is
easy and is free from both the above objections. The arrange-
ment in its most simple form consists of a long narrow trough
filled with the liquid to be measured, say dilute acid. A porous
pot containing a zinc plate in sulphate of zinc being placed in
the acid at one end of the trough, and a similar pot with a
copper plate in sulphate of copper in the acid at the other end,
the whole arrangement forms a sort ol elongated Daniell's cell,
the chief resistance of which is in the long column of acid. The
circuit between the plates being completed through a resistance
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
box and mirror galvanometer, the current is shunted until a
suitable deflection is obtained. One of the porous pots is now
moved along the trough towards the other, and, as the resistance
of the circuit is thus reduced by shortening the column of acid,
the galvanometer deflection largely increases. The external
resistance is now increased by means of the box, until the deflec-
tion is reduced to the same point as at first. This resistance put
into the circuit is evidently equal to that of the liquid taken out,
and thus a measure of the liquid resistance is obtained. Two
forms of apparatus were shown. In one, the vessels containing
sulphate of zinc and sulphate of copper respectively, formed
pistons in a glass tube which contained the liquid to be examined.
In the other, two pairs of concentric vessels were connected by
a bent glass tube which contained the liquid under examination.
The method is applicable to a great variety of liquids, and with
care almost any degree of accuracy may be obtained. The chief
obstacle to exact measurements lies in the fact that the resistance
of liquids is greatly affected by temperature, but this difficulty is,
of course, common to all methods. Mr. Wilson has been expe-

of practising medicine, took up chemistry as the aim of his
life, and repaired to Stockholm as a pupil of Berrelius. Choosing
the route from Liibeck by sea, he was obliged to wait six
weeks for the departure of a boat. The tedious stay in that
harbour was shortened through the acquaintance of a mineral
dealer already known to Wohler from the Frankfort fair, where
he had exchanged hyaliths for other minerals, and where Wohler
had met Goethe bent upon a similar errand. He also made the
acquaintance of a pharmaceutical chemist, Mr. Kind, at Liibeck,
and with him prepared potassium in quantities hitherto unknown
in Germany, and which, later on, Berzelius made use of in his
studies of boron and silicium. Arriving after a stormy passage,
he managed to find his way, by the aid of a Swedish student,
with whom he had to talk Latin, the only language they had in
common. He trembled almost at the first interview with the
celebrated chemist, but was soon put at ease by his genial
manner. Berzelius's laboratory was of the simplest. It consisted
of two bare rooms and of a kitchen, which served at the same
lime for cooking the meals of the bachelor-household. This
was the time when Berzelius had just adopted the chlorine
theory. An old maiden cook who reigned supreme at the

heartli complaining one day of the smell of "oxidised muriatic
acid," Berzelius exclaimed, smiling, "There is no longer any
oxymuriatic acid, Anna; you must say it smells very badly
of chlorine." To try his pupil's patience, he put him to the
analysis of lievriete, demanding great exactness. When the
analysis did not come up to the mark, he said: "Doctor, that
was quick, but bad." But soon he took the greatest interest in
his pupil's researches on cyanic acid, for which the ferrocyanide
of potassium had to be sent for from Liibeck. Berzelius kept
his simplicity in his intercourse with the courtiers who sometimes
visited the laboratory, and for whom some interesting experi-
ments had to be performed. He was an excellent narrator, and
Wohler listened with the greatest interest to his recollections of
Gay Lussac and of Sir Humphry Davy. Wohler passed a very
busy winter, spending his evenings in translating Berzelius'
annual reports and Hisinger's treatise on mineralogy. When the
spring came he enjoyed walks in the beautiful neighbourhood of
Stockholm, studded with the last oaks of the northern zone, and
he became intimately acquainted with the Swedish philosophers
Caro, Mosancler, Retzius, Arfvedson, Hisinger, and others who
have now all left the scene of life. At last the time arrived
when he had to take his departure from Sweden, and he did so,
accompanied by Berzelius himself, who had invited him to take
a journey through Sweden and Norway. Many mineral trea-
sures were collected on the road, and the great mines and indus-

trial establishments were visited. At Helsingborg the travellers
stopped for several days to wait for the arrival of Brogniart,
lather and SOD, the French geologists, and of Sir Humphry
Davy. The latter was then salmon-fishing in Norway, and
announced his arrival to Berzelius in a letter commencing, "My
dear sir and very honoured brother in science." He had some
kind and encouraging words for young Wohler, not forgotten by
the latter in his celebrity and his old age. Sir Humphry soon
left for Copenhagen, where he had an engagement to shoot
snipe with Forchhammer. Oerstedt arrived also to pay Berze-
lius his respects, and so did several professors from the neigh-
bouring university of Lund. In fact, Berzelius's celebrity was
to great that an official in the passport office refused to take any
Ice from the pupil who had come to study under such a master.
Messrs. Brogniart had taken their comfortable travelling carriage
over from Paris. Their comfort, however, was disturbed by the
arrival of a French courier, the bearer, as they feared, of news of
Louis XVIII.'s death. Putting the question to the courier, they
received the answer, "Messieurs, vous savez, qu'un courier doit

HOLLAND'S "FRAGMENTARY PAPERS"
Fragmentary Papers on Science and other Subjects. By
the late Sir Henry Holland, Bart. Edited by his Son,
Rev. Francis J. Holland. (London : Longmans, 1875.)
IT is impossible not to be struck with the width of
knowledge, the balance of intellect, and the true
wisdom shown in the posthumous writings of the late
Sir Henry Holland. This distinguished physician was
born as long ago as 1788, when many of the most exten-
sive and important sciences—Chemistry, Electricity,
Heat, Geology, and others—could hardly be said to
exist. Yet we find in these papers that he was fully
alive to discoveries which were quite recently made. Not
only does he appear to have accepted the Evolution
Philosophy in a thorough-going manner, and to have
acquired a perfect comprehension of its bearings and
results, but the latest discoveries in each branch of
physical science were familiar to him, and duly con-
sidered in retouching his papers for the last time.
Writing in 1873 at the age of eighty-five, he naively
remarks that it would be impossible at his age to re-write
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
the whole of his essays so as to bring them up completely
to the present day. He therefore proposed to select
what was most suitable for publication, making such
additions as were suggested by the recent progress of
research.
The essays, as now published, range over most of the
physical and moral sciences, and touch upon theology.
The Plurality of Worlds, Creative Power, Matter and
Force, Divisibility of Matter, the Nature of Electricity,
Animal Instincts, the Perfectibility of Man, Infinity,
Eternity, Materialism, Scepticism, Subjective Functions
of the Eye, Sleep and Dreams,—such are only a part of
the topics upon which he discourses. It is, of course, out
of the question that an old man writing between the
seventieth and eighty-fifth year of his age could give much
that is original and novel upon such a wide range of
subjects. Of this he must have been fully conscious, and
his object appears rather to have been to sum up the
results of the progress of science as he had witnessed that
progress, and to point out how far it had really gone in
comparison with the possible sphere of discovery. His
principal conclusion is, that no efforts of scientific men
have yet, or indeed ever can, penetrate the mysteries of
existence. His favourite expression is that of Laplace:
"Notre ignorance est immense."
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
He more fully states his convictions in the following
words :—
"The horizon of our knowledge continually, though un-
equally, expands—obscure in its boundary on every side,
and ultimately defined by limits impassable to human
reason. One man by genius or happy accident may
press more closely than another towards this horizon;
but the ultimate limit is the same to all, involving those
mysteries of matter, force, and creative or governmental
power, to which all other problems are subordinate."
One of the most original and interesting essays is that
in which Sir Henry Holland treats of " mental operations
in relation to time." The same subject had, indeed, been
discussed in two chapters of his " Mental Physiology,"
VOL. xn.—No. 297
and he had shown how many striking illustrations of the
relations of states of mind in succession, one to the other,
may be discovered. He wished to see carried out an
experimental inquiry into the chronometry of mind, by
observing the velocity with which trains of ideas can be
made to move through the mind in various circumstances,

following up the hints given by Sir Henry Holland, Prof.
Wendell Holmes, and some others, useful results might
be obtained. It is difficult to help agreeing with Sir
Henry when he remarks that the opinions of Comte on
this subject are a sheer paradox (p. 97). Comte strangely
denied the competence of consciousness as an interpreter
of mental functions. It may perhaps be allowed that
consciousness has not been happily investigated hitherto,
but it would be wholly premature to assert that it is
incapable of scientific investigation.

THIS well-known work, of which the seventh edition
is now before us, first made its appearance in the
past generation. During the life-time of its original
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
projector and editor, Dr. Andrew Ure, it undoubtedly
contributed largely to advance the education and progress
of our manufacturing and industrial classes, and well-
thumbed copies of it are to be found on the library shelves
of all the "Mechanics' Institutions" which the educa-
tional revival of thirty years ago scattered over the land.
We find from the preface that since 1858, when the
present editor took charge of the work, three editions,
including the present, have appeared, so that its reputa-
tion as a standard work of reference appears to be still
maintained.
In the volumes now before us, there are, as might be
expected, great differences from the edition which pre-
ceded them, many new industries having arisen, while
others, if they have not altogether disappeared, have at
least lost much of their importance. The alterations thus
arising have overpassed the space left available by the
curtailment and omission of some of the articles which
had lost their value, and have increased the size of the
work to a total of 3,255 pages for the three volumes.
Although a long list of contributors succeeds the preface,
we imagine that the burden of the major part of this
increase must have fallen on the two editors, and.it is
therefore with considerable pleasure that we congratulate
them on the thorough manner in which the revision has

been effected, and the very full and complete information
given in nearly all cases. We must not, perhaps, com-
plain if Jthe information given in such articles as "Ali-
zarine" and " Aniline " is not very full, since the complete
knowledge of the actual methods of production em-
ployed in these and in other cases of chemical manufacture
are in tke possession of persons whose interest it is not
to be very explicit in matters involving manufacturing
secrets. While, however, the editors are to be praised for
keeping the articles abreast of the time in other respects,
we cannot agree with them that it is good policy to retain,
as they have done, the old equivalence formulas beside the
atomic ones which are now, and have been for years
past, in such general use as to justify the exclusion of the
former altogether, as has been done in every other work
on chemical subjects printed within the last five years.
The acquisition of the modern views and system of
formulae is really so simple a matter that there is no
justification for its not being made by everyone interested
in the science, and the retention of both forms tends to
confuse young workers while conferring at best a doubt-

NATURE
Respecting the first of these animals, the statement
that "only one species of buffalo (Bubalus caffer) is
found in the southern part of Africa," is confirmatory
of the results arrived at by all other investigators. Their
abundance and ferocity when charging are much empha-
sised.
Our knowledge of the Afiican rhinoceroses is much
more imperfect than that of their Indian allies, and Mr.
Drummond's remarks on these animals must be looked
upon as those of a reliable and acute observer. We read:
"As far as my experience and inquiries have gone, I
believe, in accordance with the recorded opinions of mott
travellers r.nd sportsmen who have given any attention to
the subject, that there are four—two of the so-called
'white,' and two of the ' black.'" The way in which these
four species are arrived at, presents one point, at least, of
special interest. The first species is the Rliitioieros
bicornis, "borele" or "upetyane," the smallest and most
dangerous of the four, it alone being in the habit of
attacking man unprovoked. The second is the A", keitlon,
the " keitloa" or " umkombe tovote," the next largest, with
the hind horn, which is quite small in all the others, very
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
nearly as big as, or even sometimes bigger than, the fore
one. In one specimen "the horns, which were unusually
good, measured twenty-four inches fcr the front one,
twenty for the back." The third species is the R. simus,
"umkave," or common white rhinoceros, the largest of
all; it is "remarkable for the great length the front horn
grows to, as well as for its gentle and inoffensive disposi-
tion." With this is united as a variety A', oswellii, in which
the front horn is particularly long and turns forwards;
and we are well disposed to agree with Mr. Drummond
in thus laying little or no stress on peculiarities in the
horns when they are not associated with other characters.
For a knowledge of the last species we have to rely
entirely on our author. It has an independent native
name, which is in its favour, being known as the "Kulu-
mane." It "differs from the other species (A?, simus) in
three important particulars: firstly, in its horns, which,
though following the conformation of R. simus, never
attain to the same size; secondly, in its measurements,
which, while considerably inferior to those of the common
white, are greater than those of the other two species,
while it is to be noted that it possesses, though in a less
marked degree, the long and prehensile upper lip which
characterises K. bicornis and A', keitloa; thirdly, in its
food, for though preferring, as was to be expected from
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the formation of its snout, the young tender shoots and
leaves of thorns, it also resembles A3, shuns in consuming
large quantities of grass. In its disposition it would
seem to combine the characteristics of the other species."
The author was fortunate enough to capture and keep
alive for a short time a very young individual of the last-
described species, and he tells us that "if a specimen were
really wanted for this country [which most certainly is the
case], and there is not a single one as yet, I have no doubt
that the difficulty of finding a substitute for its mother's milk
—a serious one in a land where cattle do not exist on
account of the tsetse—might be got over by the sacrifice
of the lives of a few cows, for, as the bite of this insect
does not cause immediate death . . . they might be
brought down to the plains, and would probably live long
enough to take the young rhinoceros to the higher dis-
tricts, where plenty of milk could be procured." It is
much to be regretted that Mr. Drummond was not able
to employ the method he thus describes so clearly, and
so put us in possession of an invaluable zoological
treasure.

student he has retained the old chemical formulae.
Surely it would have been better to swim with the times
and adopt the new atomic weights, taking care to abolish
all doubtful tests, and adding the latest and most accurate
methods of analysis. Many of the latest and most delicate
methods of mineral analysis are entirely omitted, such as
liunsen's methods for the detection of arsenic, antimony,
selenium, molybdanum, uranium, &c. The work in
question is divided into two distinct parts; the first con-
taining descriptions of the different apparatus and re-
agents used, and a "Systematic Course of Blowpipe
Analysis ; " the second, styled "Determinative Minera-
logy," makes use of the knowledge acquired in the first
part to determine the mineral species under examination.
The " Systematic Course of Blowpipe Analysis " is adapted
from the later editions of Planner's work on Blowpipe
Analysis, edited by his successor, Prof. Richter; the
"Determinative Mineralogy" is a translation of Von
Kobell's " Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien," tenth
edition. Generally speaking, students do not take kindly
to " Tables," but Prof. Brush has made them more in-

viting by arranging the minerals having the same base
into groups, and studying them in order. This is an
excellent arrangement, and the distinguished author
deserves the gratitude of students for thus lightening their
labours. Too many mineralogical works of the present
day exhibit a harum-scarum kind of classification, which
simply bewilders the inquiring student and leaves him
in greater confusion than before. The first part of the
work opens with descriptions of various kinds of blow-
pipes, and the manner of using them, also the fuel
used to obtain the requisite flame. Here, under the
headings " Reducing" and "Oxidising" flames, are de-
scribed very clearly the characters of the two flames,
with very good engravings showing the zones. The
methods for preparing the various reagents required are
trivial and should .have been omitted ; for instance, we
are told to prepare pure carbonate of soda by taking
"four or five ounces of commercial bicarbonate of soda
free from mechanical impurities" &c. We should be
glad to know where Prof. Brush obtains his commer-
cial bicarbonate of soda so free from impurity, as the
manufacturer deserves encouragement. Chapter II. com-
mences the "Systematic Course of Qualitative Blow-
pipe Analysis," describing the reactions of the elements
and their combinations in the "closed tube and open

lube," and on "Charcoal as a support." Under the
latter heading a very neat and novel method is given for
overcoming the great difficulty experienced sometimes in
keeping the assay in its place on the charcoal. Let those
who wish to work in comfort for the future buy the book,
and find the method therein.
Further on, the colours imparted to a flame by different
metallic salts are described, but all of them, with the excep-
tion of copper, sodium, potassium, lithium, and calcium,
might have been left out with perfect justice, for no one could
decide what metal was present from a simple examination
of the coloured flame as described; that could only be J
done by means of the spectroscope. Then follow "The
uses of Fluxes and Roasting," and " Fusion with Borax,"
which are simply adaptations from Plattner, and the
tables given in this division are literal translations from
the same author, which may also be said of the division
"Fusion with Salt of Phosphorus." It is only fair to say
that in the preface to his book Prof. Brush states: "The

paring the reactions obtained with the specimen, the
name is ascertained without difficulty. An example will
suffice to show this:—" The mineral has a metallic lustre.
Its degree of fusibility is 2, and a portion of it is readily
volatile, evolving the garlic-like smell peculiar to arsenical
minerals. On looking at the tables it is found to belong
to Division I. Fused with carbonate of sodium on char-
coal in the reducing flame, no metallic globule is obtained,
but the reaction for sulphur is seen on moistening the
fused mass and placing it upon a piece of silver. Does
not give the reactions for copper or cobalt. In the
closed tube gives metallic arsenic, and after long heating
becomes magnetic. It is found that it can only be one of
two minerals, viz., Arsenopyrite (mispickel) or Lolingite.
The streaks, colour, and hardness are the same; but two
reactions observed before prove it to be arsenopyrite, for
it fuses at 2, and gives a strong sulphur reaction." As
we have pointed out, it might have been expected that so

OUR BOOK SHELF
Elementary Chemistry. By F. S. Barff, M. A. (London:
Edward Stanford, 1875.)
THE question which naturally occurs to one on opening
this book is, Why was it written? Of late we have had
so many books professing to teach elementary chemistry,
and some of these really fulfilling their profession, that it
is hard to understand why another should be added to
the list. In his preface the author says : "This book, as
far as it goes, professes to enable the attentive student to
acquire a sound knowledge of the very elementary facts
concerning the most important of the 'non-metallic ele-
ments,' as they are called." Again, he expresses the
belief that by the system he has adopted, " boys will have
their reasoning faculties strengthened and their powers of
observation rendered accurate and acute."
So far as mere facts are concerned, this book appears to
to be very trustworthy; the author is evidently well ac-
quainted with his subject; but there is a want of principles
toguidethestudent. If chemistry is to be taught thoroughly,
even in its elements, the method of teaching adopted
must from the very beginning be a scientific method; it
must seek not only to inculcate accuracy of knowledge in
detail, but also to point out the generalised expressions
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which bind together the facts into a connected system.
By studying the book before us a boy may certainly gain
a considerable amount of good and useful knowledge, but
we are afraid that his ideas of what chemical science is will
be at best but vague. The author does not appear to have
clearly set before himself the end which he desired to
secure by writing a book on elementary chemistrj. If
that end was merely to supply a collection of useful facts
about various chemical substances and processes, he has
succeeded; but books already existed which supplied this
want. If he wished to supply sound chemical knowledge,
so far as the book goes, he must be said also to have suc-
ceeded, but unfortunately he has stopped too soon; the
fault is that it does not go quite far enough: a little more
carefulness in planning the book, and the introduction of
at least a few generalisations to explain the facts, would
have added vastly to the value of the book as an
elementary educational work. If we compare this
little book with others which might be named which
cover much the same ground, the want' of general
ideas to guide the student becomes very apparent.

selenium is greater in the light than in the dark. It was at first
thought possible that this increase of resistance might be due to
heat admitted with the light, but Prof. W. G. Adams, in his
paper read before the Royal Society, June 17th, 1875, has
shown that this is not the case, but that the phenomenon is a
purely optical one. ,
The writer of this letter has to-day tried an experiment with a
selenium bar belonging to the Cavendish Laboratory. Its length
is 50 mm., breadth 8 mm., thickness about I mm. ; platinum
wire* are soldered to its ends, and it has a hard metallic surface.
Its electrical resistance is enormous. In the dark it is just over
100 megohms (ioo,ooo,coo B.A.U.) When, however, the light of
the paraffin lamp of the galvanometer was allowed to fall on it
from the distance of about a foot, the resistance decreased
between 20 and 30 per cent. The experiment was repeated
many times, with current sent sometimes one way, sometimes
another, and with different sides and edges of the bar turned to
the light, but always with the same result, namely, that the effect
of letting in the light was to largely decrease the resistance.
A second set of experiments were made with a selenium medal
stiuck by Berzelius soon after the discovery of the metal in 1818,
and presented by him to Mr. Deck, by whose son, Mr. Deck of
Cambridge, it was kindly lent for the experiment. This medal
was of oval shape, about 40 millims. long by 30 broad. Owing
to the difference of form between the two specimens, their

specific resistances could not be accurately compared; that of
the medal was, however, not more than about ,\, of that of the
bar. The medal was exactly like black lead both to touch and
sight, and quite different in appearance to the bar. The resist-
ance of the medal was sensibly the same, both in the dark and
in the light; no difference could be detected.
These experiments seem to show that the physical form of
the metal has a great deal to do with its behaviour when carrying
an electric current and exposed to light.

The House-fly
As no one more competent than myself seems disposed to
reply to the query of " Harrovian" (Nature, vol. xii. p. 126)
respecting a disease of the house-fly, and which is again referred
to by the Rev. I). Kdwardes in last week's Nature, I may
perhaps be permitted to make a few remarks thereon.
I have frequently noticed dead and dying flies thus affected,
generally in the late summer and autumn; and 1 think I am
right in atiributing the phenomenon to the growth of a parasitic
fungus, called, I believe, Kmpusa musci, in the fly's body. The

Meteorological Phenomenon
While walking out yesterday afternoon my attention was
drawn to a very remarkable display of mares-tail clouds spread-
ing from the north, stretching in broad and narrow bands in every
direction over the whole sky, and reaching beyond the zenith.
While standing thus facing the sun, I saw, at a great elevation, a
coloured bow with its convex red side towards the sun; it was
only about one-sixth or one-seventh of a circle, and its width
seemed to be only about half that of an average ordinary rain-
bow. It had the appearance of being nearly horizontal, with its
centre not far from the zenith, but probably not so distant. Not

being accustomed to estimate elevations, when I got home I
took a quadrant and held it about the elevation of the part of the
bow nearest the sun, and found it came out, on repeated trials,
at a ztnilh distance of 250 or 26'.* When I first saw the bow it
was just 6h. 30m. p.m. Greenwich time, and the sun appeared to
be about 15° above the horizon (that you can correct by calcu-
lation). The sun was shining brightly, and the bow was pro-
jected over a patch of sky slightly dimmed, at a great height
(but below the cirri ?), by a smoke-grey haze; its ends just pro-
jected over the edges of the clouds. It lasted about 2m.

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
Sufi's Description of the Fixed Stars.—The
author of the ancient Uranometria to which we adverted
last week. Abd-al-Rahman al-Siifi (an abbreviation of a
much longer name), was born in 903 ; he was of the sect
of the Sufis, and of Rai, a place to the east of Teheran.
He was in high favour with Adhad al-Davlat, of the reign-
ing family ot Persia, and it was principally for the instruc-
tion of this prince that he wrote the work under notice,
which was not the only one he produced. Ibn Jounis
reports that he was not only an observer, but framed astro-
nomical tables; and Dr. Schjellerup states he is known to

have undertaken geodetic operations. He is said to have
determined the length of the year, and in his tables fixes
the mean motion of the sun in the Persian year at
359° 45' 4°"'2. He died in May 986. The prince Adhad
al-Davlat, who gave great encouragement to the study of
the sciences, commenced his reign in 949, and at the
time of his death, in 983, governed the extent of country
situate between the Caspian and the Persian Gulf.
The translation of the "Description of the Fixed
Stars" by Sufi was made by Dr. Schjellerup from a
manuscript preserved in the Royal Library at Copen-
hagen, which came into the possession of Niebuhr in
1763. It is a copy made in 1601 from a manuscript
transcribed in 1013, and, as stated by Schjellerup,
"directement d'aprcs l'exemplaire de Sufi." The trans-
lation was finished when the Danish astronomer, through
Herr Dorn, had the opportunity of consulting another
copy of Sufi's work, recently acquired by the Imperial
Library of St. Petersburg. Where differences exist
between the two authorities, they are particularised in
notes to Schjellerup's translation.

advantages over the stations in the plains, viz., that there
are nearly 7,000 feet less atmosphere above it, and it is
free from the dust haze, so prevalent on the plains, which
perhaps more than water vapour (if not thickly con-
densed) stops a large part of the solar radiation. On clear
days and in intervals between the clouds, the sun's heat
is sometimes very intense. The table that follows has
been compiled in a different manner from that which I

during the greater part of the year), I have taken the

temperatures recorded on the same days; the mean of
the six observations being taken to represent the month.
The same instrument has been in use since the obser-
vations were commenced in April 1870. I must leave it
to meteorologists at home to compare these temperatures
with the recorded sun-spot areas, which I am unable to
ascertain. Iiut the maximum radiation temperature evi-

column ot water would indicate directly the intensity of
the radiation of the sun in calories if the ice did not also
partly melt in consequence of the surrounding warm air.
In order to eliminate this influence, the progress of the
column of water must be observed before and after the
actual experiment, and during these observations the sun's
rays must be shut out from the apparatus by a screen.
The difference of the readings with and without the sun's
rays will then indicate the density of the latter. But this
method has a drawback. It was found that with experi-
ments which were made in quick succession, when the ap-
paratus was exposed to the sun's rays, that the first results
were always a little larger than the following ones, and
that only after some time had elapsed did the results show
a constant value. The reason of this is doubtless the
formation of a stagnant layer of water in the apparatus
below the blackened plate, and this layer must first reach
a stationary position before anything like regularity is ob-
tained in the results.
With regard to the general results of these experiments,
which were made by Messrs. Ront.uen and Exner on the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:47 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
platform of Strassburg Cathedral, the absolute values of
the intensity of the radiation of the sun are considerably
larger than those found by Pouillet. If Pouillet's values
are reduced to the same measures and units, which form
the basis of the values obtained by Rontgen and Exner, we
find, for instance, for the month of June and the sun's eleva-
tion I2h. the value i'i4o, while the latter observers still
obtained i'226 for an elevation of 12I1. 15m. Further, we
must remark that the values obtained by Rontgen and
Exner are decidedly too small (the observations record
the progress of the column of water after the stationary
condition of the stagnant layer of water), and that accor-
ding to a rough guess they should be at least 20 per cent,
to 25 per cent, larger; thus it is certain that Pouillet's
values must be looked upon as considerably too small.

when the longer anthers have advanced a little further,
two small openings are frequently obvious {0 o, Fig. 69),

exclusion, however, of all other insects from the honey

between the shorter and the two adjacent longer filaments.
Cross-fertilisation by the visits of moths is secured in the
following manner. From the one or two small openings (0,
Figs. 68, 69) the proboscis of the moth is guided down-
wards by the longer filaments as in a channel, first along
one side of the stigma {st, Fig. 66), which has bent down-
wards on both sides just into the way of the proboscis, then
Fig. 70.—The same in its last state.
(Figs. 66-70 are seven times magnified.)
along the shorter anther (a', Fig. 66), which from the
other side has turned its pollen-covered front likewise
exactly into the way of the proboscis, until at last it
reaches the honey (h, Fig. 66); the proboscis afterwards
wetted with honey at its tip, when retracted, first touches
again the anther a' with one side, which is thus charged
with pollen, then with the other side the stigma, which thus
escapes fertilisation with its own pollen, and when in the
next visited flower the tip of the proboscis with its pollen-
charged side touches the stigma, cross-fertilisation is
effected.
My daughter Agnes, perseveringly watching Hespcris
tristis during several mild evenings in the month of May,
has succeeded in observing and catching the following
fertilisers of it:—(1) Plusia gamma, frequently (length of
the proboscis 16-18 mm.); (2) Hadcna sp. (11 mm.);
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
(3) Dianthcecia conspersa, W.V., twice (13 mm.); (4)
Iodis lactearia, L.; (5) Botys forficalis, L., three times.
But although in calm and warm evenings, as is proved
by these observations, cross-fertilisation may be suffi-
ciently effected; yet in unfavourable weather all flowers
of many individuals develop and fade without experiencing
any visit of fertilisers. In this case, nevertheless, almost
every ovary develops and brings to maturity its seed-
vessels, self-fertilisation being regularly effected by the
pistil growing and the stigma coming into contact with
pollen-grains of the four longer anthers.
Thus, in these flowers the four longer anthers have
apparently no other function in the first period of flowering
but to exclude incompetent visitors from the honey, by
stopping the entrance of the flower, and, by the direction
of their filaments, to keep the proboscis of the fertilisers in
the right direction, whilst in a later period, in case visits
of moths have been wanting, they regularly effect self-
fertilisation. The two shorter anthers, on the contrary, are
exclusively adapted to cross-fertilisation by visiting moths.

ciency a mode of observing the sun—namely, by a single
lens, a heliostat, an'd photograph—which he independently
conceived, and was the first to utilise as a form of syste-
matic observatory work. French astronomers have lately
been contending with one another about priority in the
conception of this method of observation, which was so
important a part of the equipment for observing the
transit of Venus last December furnished to American
expeditions; but in all that really constitutes effective
originality, the honour of this invention undoubtedly
belongs to Prof. Winlock. He was, however, almost
entirely indifferent, in the singleness of his devotion to
his favourite science, to popular fame, or even to con-
temporary recognition. Besides his observatory work, he
was engaged on two occasions in the direction of expedi-
tions to observe solnr eclipses—namely, that to Kentucky
in August 1869, and that to Spain in December 1870.
Though ingenious as an inventor, his judiciousness was
so much more prominent a quality that his originality is
shown rather in a thoroughness and detailed efficiency of
contrivance than in the more brilliant qualities that dis-
tinguish the more famous inventors. Very numerous
little but very effective improvements in astronomical
methods distinguish the astronomical art of the present
day; and in these Prof. Winlock's originality was consider-

of the planet Mercury (arranged with characteristic
neatness and ingenuity); brief papers in astronomical
journals and in the Proceedings of the American Academy
of Arts and Scifnccs. He was a native of Kentucky, and
the grandson of General Joseph Winlock, who entered

On July 5 the Sub-Wealden boring had reached the depth of
1,400 feet, and it is expected that this week it will have reached
1,500 feet. But this will have quite exhausted the funds of the
Committee, and Mr. Henry Wille'.t appeals for more sub-
scriptions. "It cannot be too widely known," he states, "that
unless 2,000 feet be reached, the solution of the problem is as
far off as ever. We have met with nothing to show that
Palaeozoic rocks, as anticipated, may not lie at the estimated
depth." We are inclined to think that Mr. Willett is too
desponding in thinking that failure " seems to be imminent"
from want of funds. We are sure there arc many wealthy men,
who, if the importance of the undertaking were properly repre-
sented to them, would come to the rescue and advance the
trifling sum necessary for the completion of the experiment.

towards the north and north-east. About nine o'clock whitish-
grey scoriaceous sand began to fall from the sky, the particles
averaging the size of a grain, but in shape longer. The dark
column moved on nearer and nearer, and the darkness rapidly
increased, while the scoriaceous hail thickened at the same rate.
A full hour before noon candles had to be lighted in the houses,
and at noon the darkness was as dense as that of a windowless
house; even abroad the fingers of the hand could not be distin-
guished at the distance of a few inches from the eye. This pitch
darkness lasted for about an hour. During the dark all glass

windows appeared like mirrors to those inside, reflecting the
objects on which the light fell as if they had been covered out-
side with a coat of quicksilver. For four consecutive hours it
was necessary to have lighted candles in the houses. During
all that time the ashes and the sand were falling thick and fast.
Lightning and claps of thunder were at the same lime seen and
heard in rapid succession, and the earth and everything seemed
to tremble again. The air was charged with electricity to such
an extent that pinnacles, and staff-pikes of iron when turned into
the air, and even one's hands when held up, seemed all ablaze.
But the thunder differed from ordinary claps in this, that it tra-
velled in rapidly-repeated echoes across the skies. When the
darkness wore off the fall of the ashes abated. The dark column
now moved inland towards the upper valleys; but, being there
met by a counter current of air, it remained at first stationary for a
while, and afterwards moved slowly down country again along
the valleys, so that once more the daylight was changed into
dusk, which was accompanied by the fall of fine ashes. After
the fall the earth was covered with a layer of ashes and scorice
from I1 inches to 8 inches deep ; coarsest where it lay thickest,

ADVICES from New Zealand represent the last shipment of
salmon ova frcm Glasgow to that country as having arrived in a
worthless state. The total length of time during which the eggs
were packed on beard ship was 121 days, or only nir.e days
longer than the period during which it has already been proved
by Mr. Buckland and Mr. Yeul that the development of salmon
may be safely retarded by ice. A large quantity of the ice
remained till the end of the voyage, so that the temperature of
the ice-houses must have been kept very low throughout the
voyage. In fact it is said that the exterior of the packing never
exceeded 43° Fahr. The officers o'f the Otago Acclimatisation
Society state that microscopic examination proved that many of
the eggs were unfertilised: but this was not the case with all;

turist as Mr. Buckland, who had charge of the operations of
collecting and packing the eggs, coulcl have improperly performed
so impoitant a duty. It is more than probable that of the
large number of ova sent, many were handled by incompetent
assistants. But this theory will cot explain the want of vitality
in the impregnated eggs, especially when the conditions for their
safe transit were so favourable. The cases in which they were
packed are described as "sodden,"so that they did not suffer
from dryness. It is probable, therefore, that want of ventilation
was the cause of the failure of the experiment. It will be in-

Prof. Bradley, of Knoxville, Tennessee, has recently pub-

rocks of the Atlantic coast as certainly pre-Silurian. This has,
however, been called in question by the observations of Prof.
Dana, which go to prove that the limestones and accompanying
schists and quartzites of Western New England area// Silurian,
and not Iluronian or Laurentian. Prof. Bradley now claims the
same for the region he has investigated, that is, the western
portion of North Carolina, the eastern part of Tennessee, and
much of Georgia and Alabama. The evidence upon which the
conclusion is based is stratigraphical, and must be studied in

Bradley to have been post-carboniferous, and it is probably refer-

period the potato bore enormous crops of berrifs, whilst since
the prevalence of the murrain it has almost ceased flowering and
fruiting; and in these facts (?) lies the whole gist of the matter.
The production of fruit in profusion is regarded as an exhausting
process so far as the tubers are concerned, and this is so far a
very philosophic assumption, inasmuch as fruit-bearing is one of
two ways to ensure the propagation of the plant. But here it
becomes necessary to give the author's view respecting the
"Functions of Nitrogenous Matter." It is in substance that
the formation of fruit draws the nitrogenous matter from the
plant and tubers, and when excessive crops of fruit are borne,
the tubers are left without sufficient of this vital principle to con-
tinue the existence of the plant. On the other hand, when little
or no fruit Is produced, the tubers are left overcharged with this
nitrogenous matter, which here becomes a source of decomposi-
tion, in proof whereof we are gravely told that the decay of
manure is due to the presence of nitrogenous matter. It has
long been admitted that excessive luxuriance predisposes in
favour of disease; but this assumed presence of nitrogenous
matter in the wrong place will hardly be accepted as an ade.

the murrain. It is assumed that the potato left off bearing
berries just about the time of the appearance of the murrain,
and this we are told was brought about by the use of artificial
manures containing a large percentage of nitrogenous matter.
The "curl " was cured or rather prevented by using sets (tubers)
from plants which had not been allowed to ripen seed. We
have not space to examine the writer's arguments in support of
this theory, but we may give his remedy.
"Having so fully set forth the natural habit of the plant, and
50 copiously elucidated the principles on which my theory of the
disease is founded, the means of its prevention all but suggest
themselves. They require compliance with but two simple
forms: regenerate through the seed two or three times, and
abstain as nearly as practicable, not only from nitrogenous arti-
ficial manures, such as guano, sulphate of ammonia, rape-cake,
nitrate of soda, but also from strong farmyard manure."
We do not intend to attempt to refute the author in detail
here, as it would occupy too much space; but we may observe
that the condition of practical experience imposed upon the
competitors for the Cathcart prize, of which our author com-
plains because it disqualified him, was the wisest provision in
the whole business. It is just this want of practical experience
and personal knowledge that has led him astray in regard to the
berry-producing power of varieties now cultivated, of the descrip-
tion of manure usually employed, &c. Why all varieties of the

potato in all parts of the kingdom should have become just so
much overcharged with nitrogenous matter at exactly the same
time as to take the disease is rather puzzling. Does the writer
not know that the Vine Mildew, Oidium Tuckeri, has been suc-
cessfully combated?
Since the preceding lines were written, the report of a new (?)
disease having attacked the potato-crop has caused some con-
sternation and alarm. First we hear that it has destroyed the
entire crop of American varieties in the trial gardens of the
Horticultural Society at Chiswick; then the appearance of the
same disease is observed in Northumberland, but here again only
American varieties are affected, and a vain hope is indulged in
that it may soon be stamped out. The following week, how-
ever, the horticultural journals begin to team with letters from
the most distant parts, and the unwelcome truth that all varieties
are alike attacked, or liable to be attacked, is forced upon us.
True, we read of certain varieties being diseased, whilst others
remain healthy in the same garden, but we fear there is no
ground for believing that it is restricted to any particular varie-
ties, whether of English or American origin. The Rev. M. J.

in a water eddy the velocity of rotation increases from the cir-
cumference towards the centre, until at the inner surface it be-
comes imaginary, so the velocity of the wind increases from the
circumference ol a revolving storm towards the centre, but at a

certain distance from the centre, the boundary of the calm space,
falls suddenly to stillness. He believes the following formula,
which applies to water, to be good for air also, both being
bounded by a resisting medium. Let water circulate in a
cylinder, where // = deptli of current at the circumference,
V = velocity of current at the surface; then at a depth x below
the surface:
when the resistance at the base is equal to that which would be
exercised by a substratum of water. If water flows in at one
point in a vessel containing water, and Hows out at another
point, and the inflowing and outflowing quantities are equal, the
turlace remains at a constant level. Let the supply be in the
middle and the outflow round the circumference, the water will
descend towards the circumference. If the contained water be
rotatory, its condition will be similar when a constant stream
flows in ; there will be an increase of pressure at all points, and
the water will attain a higher level, descending in the directions
of its escape. A whirlwind can withstand pressure from without
only when the rotation has a certain velocity, and although a
considerable quantity of air must How to the whirlwind along the

SCIENTIFIC WORT HIES
V.—George Gabriel Stokes
A GREAT experimental philosopher, of the age just
•**• past, is reported to have said, " Show me the scien-
tific man who never made a mistake, and I will show you
one who never made a discovery." The implied inference
is all but universally correct, but now and then there
occur splendid exceptions (such as arc commonly said to
be requisite to prove a rule), and among these there has
been none more notable than the present holder of
Newton's chair in Cambridge, George Gabriel Stokes,
Secretary of the Royal Society.
To us, who were mere undergraduates when he was
elected to the Lucasian Professorship, but who had with
mysterious awe speculated on the relative merits of the
men of European fame whom we expected to find com-
peting for so high an honour, the election of a young and
(to us) unknown candidate was a very startling pheno-
menon. But we were still more startled, a few months
afterwards, when the new professor gave public notice
that he considered it part of the duties of his office to
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
assist any member of the University in difficulties he
might encounter in his mathematical studies. Here was,
we thought (in the language which Scott puts into the
mouth of Richard Cceur de Lion), "a single knight, fight-
ing against the whole mlUe of the tournament." But we
soon discovered our mistake, and felt that the under-
taking was the effect of an earnest sense of duty on
the conscience of a singularly modest, but exceptionally
able, and learned man. And, as our own knowledge gra-
dually increased, and we became able to understand his
numerous original investigations, we saw more and more
clearly that the electors had indeed consulted the best
interests of the University; and that the proffer of assist-
ance was something whose benefits were as certain to be
tangible and real as any that mere human power and
knowledge could guarantee.
And so it has proved. Prof. Stokes may justly be
looked upon as in a sense one of the intellectual parents
of the present splendid school of Natural Philosophers
whom Cambridge has nurtured—the school which num-
bers in its ranks Sir William Thomson and Prof. Clerk-
Maxwell.
All of these, and Stokes also, undoubtedly owe much
(more perhaps than they can tell) to the late William
Hopkins. He was, indeed, one whose memory will ever
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be cherished with filial affection by all who were fortunate
enough to be his pupils.
But when they were able, as it were, to walk without
assistance, they all (more or less wittingly) took Stokes
as a model. And the model could not but be a good one:
it is all but that of Newton himself. Newton's wonderful
combination of mathematical power with experimental
skill, without which the Natural Philosopher is but a
fragment of what he should be, lives again in his suc-
cesses Stokes has attacked many questions of the
gravest order of difficulty in pure mathematics, and has
carried out delicate and complex experimental researches
of the highest originality, alike with splendid success. But

several of his greatest triumphs have been won in fields
where progress demands that these distinct and rarely
associated powers.be brought simultaneously into action.
For there the mathematician has not rrerely to save the
experimenter from the fruitless labour of pushing his
inquiries in directions where he can be sure that (by the
processes employed) nothing new is to be learned; he has

drudgery of Secretary to the Commissioners for the
University of Cambridge; or of a Lecturer in the School
of Mines; or the exhausting labour and totally inadequate
remuneration of a Secretary to the Royal Society! Men
know about these things, as well as about a good many
other important things, much better in Germany than we
yet know them; and it will not be very long before we
in our turn will be forced to know them to the full as well
Let us hope that this knowledge may come to us in a more
gentle form than that of the rude and sudden lessons
which have so lately been read (for something very like
the same fatal blindness) alike to Austria and to France!
The magnificent Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific
Papers, one of the greatest boons ever conferred on men
of science, shows that up to 1864 Stokes had published
the results of some seventy distinct investigations; on an
average between three^and four per annum. Several of
these are controversial; designed not so. much to establish
new results as to upset false and dangerously misleading
assertions. Some are improvements on the mathematical
methods usually employed in the treatment of compara-

tively elementary portions of physics; and, especially
those on the Hydrokinetic Equations and on Waves, are
exceedingly valuable. These appeared in the Cambridge
and Dublin Mathematical Journal.
Of the higher purely mathematical papers of Stokes we
cannot here attempt to give even a meagre sketch. It
would be hopeless to attempt to give the general reader
an idea of what is meant by- the " Critical Values of the
Sums of Periodic Series," or even by the "Numerical
Calculation of Definite Integrals and Infinite Series;"
though we may simply state that under these heads are
included some of the most important improvements which
pure mathematics have recently received with the view of
fitting them for physical applications.
In applied mathematics it is hard to make a selection,
so numerous and so important are Stokes* papers. But
we may mention specially the following :—
"On the Friction of Fluids in Motion, and the Equili.
bruin and Motion of Elastic Solids." Camb, PhiL
Trans., 1845.
"On the Effects of the Internal Friction of Fluids on
the Motion of Pendulums." Ibid. 1850.
(In these papers, for the first time, it is shown how to
take account of difference of pressure in different direc-
tions in the equations of motion of a viscous fluid ; the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
suspension of globules of water in the air as a cloud is
for the first time explained and the vesicular theory
utterly exploded; and the notion of Navier and Poisson
as to a necessary numerical relation between the rigidity
and the compressibility of a solid is shown to be un-
tenable. Each one of these is a distinct, and exceedingly
great, advance in science ; but they are only single gems
chosen, as we happen to recollect them, from a rich
treasury.)
Then we have a series of magnificent researches on the
"Undulatory Theory of Light," for the most part also
published in the Cambridge Philosophical Transaction.
Of these we need mention only three :—
"On the Dynamical Theory of Diffraction." 1849.
(Here, in addition to 'a splendid experimental inquiry
as to the position of the plane of polarisation with refer-
ence to the direction of vibration, we have an invaluable
inquiry into the properties and relations of Laplace's
Operator, an inquiry bearing not alone upon the Undula-
tory Theory, but also upon gravity, electric and magnetic
attractions, and generally upon all forces whose intensity

they run the risk of being wholly lost—unless inde-
pendently discovered. But he has not time to draw them
up with the last possible improvements, nor to publish
that Treatise on Light and Sound which we all so eagerly
expect. Hence the world has to wait while the author
devotes his powers to work which a clerk could do nearly
as well!
Of these later papers, however, that "On the Long
Spectrum of the Electric Light," and particularly those
on the " Absorption Spectrum of Blood," are of very great
value, the latter especially for their physiological appli-
cations.
We must not omit to mention that, partly in conjunc-
tion with the late Mr. Vernon Harcourt, Stokes has made
a most valuable experimental inquiry into what is called
Irrationality of Dispersion, chiefly with a view to the
further improvement of achromatic telescopes.
He has also proved, by very exact measurements, that
the wave-surface for the extraordinary ray in uniaxal
crystals is (at least to the degree of accuracy of his expe-
riments) rigorously an ellipsoid of revolution. From the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
theoretical point of view this is a result of extreme im-
portance; and it is a happy illustration of what we have
already said as to the conjunction in Stokes of the expe-
rimenter and the mathematician.
Several of his papers are devoted to the extraordinary
and, at least at first sight, apparently incongruous proper-
ties of the Luminiferous Ether—more especially with the
view of explaining (on the Undulatory Theory) the ob-
served Law of the Aberration of Light. He has also
reaped an early harvest from the even now promising
field of the connection between Absorption and quasi-
metallic Reflection of Light—and has furnished the
student with an admirably simple investigation of the
Conduction of Heat in Crystals.
It is quite possible that, in hurriedly jotting down our
impressions and recollections of Stokes' work, we may
have omitted something of even greater value than we
have recorded. But if so, does the fact not show the
absolute necessity that exists for a reprint of all Stokes'
works, collected alike from the almost inaccessible Cain-
bridge Philosophical Transactions, the ponderous Philo-
sophical Transactions, &c.t no less than from the Sttzungs-
berichte of the Imperial Academy of Vienna, in which we
find Stokes suggesting a preservative for miners against
the deadly vapour of mercury?

Stokes was President of the British Association at the
Exeter meeting in 1869. The Address he then delivered
was a thoroughly excellent and appropriate one; and its
modest but firm concluding paragraphs are well calculated
to reassure those who may have been perplexed or puzzled
by the quasi-scientific materialism of the present day.

SCIENCE EDUCATION FROM BELOW
E Science Department of the Committee of Council
on Education was instituted twenty-two years ago.
At that time the general public was far from being alive
to its advantages, and for the first seven years it achieved
very little. The second term of seven years showed a
considerable increase in the number of science schools
throughout the country; but it was only_during the third
septennial period (1867 to 1874) that the importance of
such an educational agency became in any sense duly
appreciated; and it is not too much to say that it is now
one of the most important scientific organisations in this
or any country.
Still, in the Government schools as elsewhere, science

in a social sense occupy the level immediately below them.
The moving impulse is from below, and to that we must
now more particularly direct our"attention.
From the first the South Kensington establishment
has acted as an examining body, and the staff ap-
pointed for that purpose includes the names of the most
eminent professors in natural and physical science.
Subject to certain limitations the passes carry with them
pecuniary grants to the authorised local teachers ; prizes
and medals of honour to the most proficient of the
students. The department also makes grants in aid of
scholarships and the Royal and local exhibitions, as
well as having the administration of those scholarships
which were endowed by Sir Joseph Whitworth. Grants
are also made in aid of new local schools of science, and
towards the cost of the apparatus which they may require.
Special classes for the improvement of acting teachers
are held by some of the Professors. Lastly, we must not

under its management, and the too little known educa-
tional library which is available to the general public on
payment of a very trifling fee.
The twenty-three branches of study dealt with include
Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics, Natural Science, and
some of the Applied Sciences. The six most popular
among the students are Physical Geography; Pure
Mathematics ; Animal Physiology ; Magnetism and Elec-
tricity ; Inorganic Chemistry ; Acoustics, Light, and Heat:
some, such as Navigation and Nautical Astronomy, are,
from their very nature, little studied except in special
localities. The large preponderance of students in
Physical Geography, generally nearly double that of the

leading feature, being included.

It is abundantly clear then that through the enlightened
and vigorous action of the Science and Art Depart-
ment, a large bulk of the population of our country has
received and is receiving an elementary scientific educa-
tion. The work which Sir Henry Cole began can no
longer be sneered at nor overlooked; its value to this
country is beginning to be widely recognised, and the
man who laid its foundations so wisely and well deserves
the highest gratitude of his countrymen. Let us re-
member that only a few years ago there was little science
education in the higher classes, and absolutely none
in the lower; whereas, scattered over Great Britain,
there are in active work this year no less than 1,707
certificated science teachers engaged in 1,374 science
schools, teaching 4,104 separate classes, and the number
of individuals actually receiving science instruction by
this means reaches the enormous total of 48,274,
The Department, however, has not been content to
rest on its laurels. Within the last few years it has under-
taken a new work, which promises to be of the highest
value. It was felt that the system of examinations needed

supplementing. Teachers could gain certificates, and
thus receive payment upon the results of their teaching,
without any evidence of their having more than book
knowledge. And it was found, indeed, that the great
body of certificated teachers had, with few exceptions,
little practical knowledge of the various subjects they
taught. They could accurately describe an electrophorus,
but they could not make one, nor use it perhaps when
made ; they knew all about the circulation of the blood
or the structure of the heart, but they had never seen the
one nor dissected the other. For the most part they
knew nature as words, not as living facts. The eminent
men who conduct the examinations for [the Department
saw the danger that was arising. Prof. Huxley addressed
the Government upon the subject, and urged a practical
class in Physiology for a certain number of science teachers
certificated in that subject. By taking fresh men each year
it was hoped that a large amount of practical knowledge
would be diffused and gradually make its way through the
various science classes. The late Government promptly
acceded to the wish thus expressed, and in 1869 two short
practical courses of a week each were given, the one on
Animal Physiology and the other on Light
The importance of even such brief instruction was so
manifest that it was decided to enlarge the original concep-

tion. The details of the scheme were, however, difficult
and needed to be grappled with in earnest. The body of
teachers was large and distributed over wide areas; they
could not afford the time nor money to come to London for
instruction, and even if they had the requisite knowledge
their means were too slender to enable them to purchase
the apparatus needed for the proper demonstration of
their subject. To the administrative genius of Major
Donelly, the present chief of the Science Staff at South
Kensington, no less than to his untiring zeal in the cause
of scientific education, the country is mainly indebted for
the solution of this formidable difficulty. Announce-
ments were made to all the certificated science teachers
throughout the country that a month or six weeks'
gratuitous course of daily practical instruction, in various
branches of experimental science, would be held at the
new Science Schools at South Kensington during the
summer vacation. Those who wished for this instruc-
tion were to apply to the Department; if selected, their
expenses to and from London would be paid, and thirty
shillings a week given to each as a maintenance allowance

practical acquaintance with the reactions which they have
so often written down, and which in future they will
regard with an altogether new interest and delight.
Others more advanced are conducting analyses, or per-
haps making "combustions "—if in the advanced group,
studying organic chemistry. All are intensely busy, and
work with a fixed purpose before them. The same quiet
activity is noticeable in the different subjects going on in
the other rooms. Entering last the physical laboratory
on the ground floor, we find the teachers constructing
apparatus which, though simple and often rough, is well
adapted for teaching purposes. The raw material is
provided them, printed instructions are given to each
one, and under the direction of Prof. Guthrie, and the
gentlemen associated with him, the most useful physical
instruments are built up. These instruments are then
employed in repeating the experiments seen in the
morning lecture, or in making physical measurements
wherever it is possible to do so. The homely apparatus,
it is true, has not the polish of the instrument-maker, but
in delicacy and efficiency is, generally speaking, far better

than the teachers could purchase out of the small grants
allowed to them lor that purpose. With a wise liberality
the Department permits each teacher to take home with
him, without any charge, all the apparatus he himself has
made : and one can easily imagine the pleasure with which
these simple and useful instruments are afterwards looked
upon and used by those who have made them. Nor is this
all]; the impulse to sound and practical science teaching is
given, and at the same time the hands have been disciplined
to useful skill, and the senses trained to accurate observa-
tion. After such preparation good use is made by the
teachers of the more refined physical instruments which
are set before them, but which are beyond their time or
power to construct for themselves. It is most instructive
to watch one of these men as he makes his first essay, and
to trace the growth of his education in manipulative skill
and in practical knowledge of his subject. We propose in
our next number to go more fully into detail in this matter,
and to describe some of the simple physical apparatus
made by the teachers.
But the good work done by the Department does not
rest here. In addition to giving practical instruction to
teachers in short summer courses, free admission to ex-
tended courses of lectures and practical instruction in
Chemistry, Physics, Mechanics, and Biology at South

Kensington was granted to a limited number of teachers
and students who intended to become science teachers.
The selected candidates received a travelling allowance,
and a maintenance allowance of 2$s. a week while in
London. The courses in Chemistry and Biology com-
menced in October of last year and ended in the early
spring, when the courses in Physics and Mechanics began,
and these closed at the beginning of this summer. From
ten to sixteen teachers in training attended these different
classes, and worked daily from 10 to 5 at the subjects they
had chosen, in the evening writing up their notes and memo-
randa. Botany was not included in the foregoing series,
but it was not forgotten. In January last the Lords of
the Committee of Council on Education gave directions
given by Prof. Thiselton Dyer, and commenced on the
4th of March last, extending over eight weeks. It was
attended by twenty-three science teachers and persons
intending to become science teachers; these received
precisely the same advantages as the teachers in training
in the other subjects.

volume, one which would alone have established the repu-

redeem our country from the charge of sterility in physio-
logical work. Much attention has been called recently to
the singular subject of ".carnivorous plants ;" we have had
records of useful original work from several quarters in
England, the Continent, and America, together with
much that has been superficial and worthless; and even
the newspapers have discussed the anti-vegetarian habits
of some vegetables in the light, airy, and philistine
manner in which they are wont to approach "mere scien-

last fifteen years, Mr. Darwin has been steadily and
quietly at work, collecting materials and recording long
series of observations; and now at length has given us
their results, completely and finally settling some of the
points that have been most in controversy, and raising
others which suggest conclusions that will take by surprise
even those whose minds have been most open to deviate
from the old and narrow paths.

the most abundant and readily obtainable of these preda-
tory plants, the common Sundew, Drosera rotuitdifolia j
and an epitome of this portion must be first placed before
our readers.
Commencing with a description of the well-known
leaves and their glandular appendages, or "tentacles,"
as he terms them, Mr. Darwin has arrived at the conclu-
sion that these latter most probably existed primordially
as glandular hairs or mere epidermal formations (tri-
chomes), and that their upper part should still be so con-
sidered; but that their lower portion, which alone is
capable of movement, consists of a prolongation of the
leaf j the spiral vessels being extended from this to the
uppermost part. One point which seems to be clearly
established is, that it is not sufficient that the substance
which excites the movements of the tentacles should
merely rest on the viscid fluid excreted from the glands;
it must be in actual contact with the gland itself. A state-
ment made by several previous observers (including Prof.
Asa Gray on the authority of Mr.'Darwin's earlier obser-
vations, and the present writer)—that inorganic substances
are almost or entirely without effect in producing
• movement—must now be modified. Although the
effect is much less considerable, and the substance
is soon released from the embrace of the tentacles j
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
yet such bodies as minute particles of glass un-
doubtedly possess the power of irritation. While it is
the glands or knobs at the extremities of the tentacles,
and a very small part of the upper portion of the
pedicels, which alone are sensitive or irritable, the actual
inflection takes place only in the lowermost portion of the
pedicel, causing a bending of the tentacle; and the
irritation is conducted from the tentacle actually excited
to the neighbouring ones, or to all those on the leaf, in
such a manner as to cause them to bend towards the
object which produces the excitement. One of the most
striking of the [series of observations here recorded is
that which describes the affixing of exciting particles on
glands at two different portions of a leaf of Drosera, the
result being that all the tentacles near each of these two
points were directed towards them, "so that two
wheels were formed on the disc of the same leaf,
the pedicels of the tentacles forming the spokes, and
the glands united in a mass " over the irritated tentacle
which represented the axle; the precision with which
each tentacle pointed to the irritating particle was

protoplasmic contents of the cells of the gland and of
those lying immediately beneath it; though the two
phenomena are not necessarily connected with one
another. If the tentacles of a young but mature leaf that
has never been excited or become inflected, are examined,
the cells forming the pedicels are seen to be filled with a
homogeneous purple fluid, the walls being lined with a
layer of colourless circulating protoplasm. If a tenta cle is
examined some hours after the gland has been excited by
repeated touches, or by an inorganic or organic particle
placed on it, or by the absorption of certain fluids, the
purple matter is found to be aggregated into masses of
various shapes suspended in a nearly or quite colourless
fluid. This change commences within the glands, and
travels gradually down the tentacles ; and the aggregated
masses of coloured protoplasm are perpetually changing

their form, separating, and again uniting. Shortly after
the tentacles have re-expanded in consequence of the
removal of the exciting substance, these little coloured
masses of protoplasm are all re-dissolved, and the purple
fluid within the cells becomes as homogeneous and trans-
parent as it was at first. This process of aggregation is
independent of the inflection of the tentacles and of
increased secretion from the glands; it commences
within the glands, and is transmitted from cell to cell
down the whole length of the tentacles, being arrested for
a short time at each transverse cell-wall. The most
remarkable part of the phenomenon is that even in those
tentacles which are inflected, not by the direct irritation
of their glands, but by an irritation conducted from other
glands on the leaf, this aggregation of the protoplasm
still commences in the cells of the gland itself.
Some who admit the reality of the phenomena now
described, have still doubted the digestive power ascribed
to the leaves of the Sundew, believing that the apparent
absorption of the organic substances in contact with the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
glands is due rather to their natural decay. This question
is, however, entirely set at rest by Mr. Darwin's observa-
tions. The action of the secretion from the glands on all
albuminous substances—for it is by these only among
fluids that inflection of the tentacles is excited—is pre-

as astonishing to everyone else as they were to Mr.
Darwin himself. From a most carefully conducted series
of experiments from which every possible source of error
seems to have been eliminated, it appears that the absorp-
tion by a gland of „jm of a grain of carbonate of am-
monia (this salt producing no effect when absorbed
through the root) is sufficient to excite inflection and
aggregation of the protoplasm. With nitrate of ammonia
a similar effect is produced by the ^.^ of a grain ; while
the incredibly small quantity of ,,-J^^ of a grain of phos-
phate of ammonia produces a like effect. Mr. Darwin
believes that carbonate of ammonia is also absorbed in
the gaseous state by the tentacles; but we venture to
think that the evidence on this point is not conclusive.
In both the experiments which he records the air sur-
rounding the plant was more or less humid, and the effect
was much more intense in the one where the air was the
dampest, indicating apparently that the inflection was
due to the absorption of the extremely soluble gas by the
moisture which was in contact with the tentacles. This
would also afford an explanation of what he regards as "a

curious fact, that some of the closely adjoining tentacles
on the same leaf were much, and some apparently not in
the least, affected," if we suppose that they were clothed
with larger and smaller amounts of moisture. The view
that the glands have no power of absorbing gases or
effluvia receives confirmation from the failure of the
attempt to induce inflection or aggregation by the affixing
of particles of meat in close proximity to the tentacles,
but without actual contact.
We cannot follow Mr. Darwin through his exhaustive
series of experiments on the effects of various solutions
of mineral salts, acids, and poisons, on the leaves of
Drosera. With organic fluids the aggregation- of the pro-
toplasm and inflection of the tentacles furnish a most
delicate and unerring test of the presence of nitrogen.
The effect of inorganic salts and poisons can by no
means be inferred from the effect of the same substances
on living animals, nor from their chemical affinity. Nine
salts of sodium all produced inflection, and were not
poisonous except when given in large doses ; while seven
of the corresponding salts of potassium did not cause
inflection, and some of these were poisonous. This cor-
responds to the statement of Dr. Burdon Sanderson,
that sodium salts may be introduced in large quantities
into the circulation of mammals without any injurious

effects, whilst small doses of potassium salts cause
death by suddenly arresting the movements of the
heart. Benzoic acid, even when so weak as to be scarcely
acid to the taste, acts with great rapidity and is highly
poisonous to Drosera, although it is without marked effect
on the animal economy. The poison of the cobra, on the
other hand, so deadly to all animals, is not at all poisonous
to Drosera, although it causes strong and rapid inflection
of the tentacles, and soon discharges all colour from the
glands.
The last point of investigation is the mode of transmis-
sion and nature of the conducting tissue of the motor
impulse from one tentacle to another. It has been already
stated that the seat of irritability is limited to the glands
themselves and a few of the uppermost cells of the
pedicels, the blade of the leaf itself not being sensitive to
any stimulant. In order to be conveyed from one ten-
tacle to another, the impulse has therefore to be trans-
mitted down nearly the whole length of the pedicel; and
it appears to be conveyed from any single gland or small
group of glands through the blade to the other tentacles

but we could have wished that, in the interests of metal-
lurgical research, some account had been given in this
place of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and of the apparatus
by means of which he melted platinum.
Care has been taken to collect the recently discovered
facts relative to the calorific power and calorific intensity
of fuel, and these are specially considered with reference
to furnace tempeiatures. The section devoted to Pyro-

The question of the utilisation of peat and of the possi-

manufacturing processes, has of late particularly engaged

collected "such evidence as may enable the reader to
arrive at a satisfactory judgment on that question," and
forty-six pages are devoted to the consideration of cutting
peat, together with its mechanical treatment, condensa-
tion, and desiccation. We may quote some of Dr.
Percy's general conclusions as to its use as fuel. He
observes that, "so far as the suitability of peat for metal-
lurgical purposes is concerned, we may not unreasonably
conclude that it could be widely substituted for coal with

only compete with coal in countries where the cost of pro-
duction and carriage of peat is relatively very low and the
price of coal is relatively very high.
More than 200 analyses of coal from various paits of
the world are given, and we may mention as an indication
of the care which has been taken to render the section
devoted to coal as complete as possible, that Von Meyer's
recent investigations as to the nature of the gases disen-
gaged from certain varieties, and Fleck's table showing
the action of weathering on the chemical composition of
coal, are recorded at some length. Valuable remarks as
to the various sources of error in the analysis of coal are
given, but we venture to think that students would have
been grateful for some account of the methods of analysis
and details of manipulation.

The Birds and Seasons of New England. By Wilson
Flagg. With Illustrations. (Boston: Osgood and Co.

Mr. Flagg is evidently an enthusiastic lover and close
observer of nature in all her moods and phases, but this
more from the sentimental and poetic than from the
scientific point of view. His book consists of a great
number of essays on various aspects of nature as mani-
fested in the New England country, the most original
being on the songs of the birds of that region. That he
must be a very patient and very minute observer is evi-
denced by the fact that he has actually embodied in mu-
sical notation the songs of some of the principal singing
birds of New England. We have no means of testing
the correctness of Mr. Flagg's interpretation of these
singers, but we should think, judging from the very care-
ful observations ^he has evidently made, that they are
generally correct. The work also contains essays on the

fact that from 1869 up to the recent opening of thejnew museum

Irish Cave Exploration
DURING the last few weeks Dr. Leiih Adams, F.R.S., and

mammoth, reindeer, bear, wolf, horse, and hare, were found in
the debris of a quarry here in 1859, and are now in the Royal
Museum, Dublin. We have worked through a considerable
quantity of limestone breccia and stalagmite, in which and in a
thin underlying deposit of cave-earth we have found numerous
bones of the above-mentioned animals, indicating at least two
individuals of mammoth, eighteen of reindeer, and five of horse,
for which latter this is as yet the sole recorded locality in Ire-
land. The bones of bear show extreme age and signs of disease,
and we have found the cast antler of a reindeer. Some of the
bones have been gnawed, probably by wolves, and many have
been broken by the falling-in of the roof of the cave. Though
we have broken into a large chamber, we are as yet unable to

Variable Stars.—Of the three stars to which CoL
Tennant draws attention as being probably variable
("Monthly Notices R.A.S.," June 1875), B.A.C. 740
appears more especially deserving of regular observation.
The B.A.C. has adopted the magnitude assigned by
Groombridge, 6; other estimates are :—Hevelius, 6;
Fedorenko (Lalande, 1789 November), 8; Piazzi, 8, by
seven observations; Schwerd, S\; Taylor, in 1834 or
1835, in vol. Hi. of "Madras Observations," 7 (he calls
the star 21 Cephei); Carrington, S'l; the Radcliffe
Catalogues, 7'5; and Durchmusterung, 8-4. With regard
to the observation of Hevelius, which has been assumed
to refer to this star, it may be remarked that the position
given in his Catalogue for 1660, where it is No. 46 in
Cepheus, does not well agree with the place of the Redhill
Catalogue for B.A.C. 740, the difference of position
amounting to 16'; nevertheless it is not easy to identify
the star observed by Hevelius with any other in the
modern catalogues. In the cases of the stars B.A.C.
4166 and'4193, also noticed by Col. Tennant, the esti-
mates of magnitude from the epoch of Schwerd's obser-
vations to the present time appear pretty accordant.

mind that in Argelander's Uranometria, and in Heis and

to be somewhat brighter than an average sixth or fifth
magnitude, and are not to be understood decimally, as is
the case in the " Durchmusterung."]
The Double-star 2 1785.—The proper motion of this

interval between Struve's first measures and the last pub-
lished by the Baron Dembowski, the amount of proper
motion, according to Argelander's values, would be
- 2o"-9 in R.A. and — 2"-4 in Decl. But the relative fixity
of the components, which might have been surmised from
Argelander's comparison of his differences of R.A. and

and distance in 1830, is clearly refuted by the recent
measures. Thus we have-

formation with double sides; these are the l-wo original
germ-layers. The space enclosed by the inner germ-
layer is the intestinal cavity; the whole formation we call
gastrula after Haeckel. As the causes of the formation of
the two germ-layers are the same for all animals con-
sisting of more than one cell (matazoa), according to
Gotte's view, the form of development of the gastrula is
therefore common to all, however indiscernible it may
often be in the outside appearance. The cause of this
is partly that the above-mentioned difference between
the upper and lower hemispheres of the ovum varies in
magnitude. Jf this difference is small, the result will be
that only a moderate part of the lower hemisphere will
be pressed inward, the inner germ-layer remaining simple,
as for instance with the lower polypi, which on the whole
consist of two layers of cells. As the energy of the inward
pressure increases, a third germ-layer, the so-called middle
one, is split off the stronger inner one; this third one,
from being a simple intermediary layer, may develop and
originate many and important organs. If in the dividing
ovum only the difference referred to in the vertical axis

exist, the gastrula is naturally formed equally in all direc-
tions between the two poles, so that if further transfor-
mations take place, these likewise occur equally in all
directions from the intestinal cavity and its principal axis,
and therefore in radiated planes or lines. Thus the
difference in the first axis of the ovum, if it acts by itself,
always leads to a radiated structure of body which we
find with Polypi, Medusa:, Echinoidea, and their relatives.
Yet the higher developed representatives of these classes
already show here and there, and in unimportant points,
indications of a transition to a higher type. If we sup-
pose the two horizontal axes of the ovum to be unequal,
then the formation of the gastrula must naturally be un-
equal likewise. The inequality, which with many of the
Vermes already shows itself during the first divisions of
the ovum, causes the gastrula to extend in one direction
more than in any other, and thus to receive another prin-
cipal axis. If at the same time the two sides precede in
development the other parts, two symmetrical masses
are formed, situated opposite one another (germ-streaks),
and which approach each other more or less on the stomach
side, and there produce certain principal organs. To this
transversedivisions may be added,asin theArthropoda; or
this may not occur, as in the Mollusca. Vertebrata finally

two opposite symmetrical sides of the ovum, but only on
one, where the odd germ-streak is situated and indicates the
future back. In a manner similar to that of the typical
foundation of the embryo, Gotte tries to deduce all
other phenomena of development not from hypothetical
causes of inheritance, but directly from the laws of the
formation of the ovum; as, for instance, the whole deve-
lopment of the different organs and tissues. Any essen-
tial change in a certain animal species must then be
deduced from a change in the laws of formation, which
are peculiar to the ovum, i.e. its first cause lies in the
ovum, and the live animal can never transfer newly-
gained changes of form directly to the law of formation
of its germs, nor thus cause its descendants to inherit
them.

In this mode of stating the question, the lines joining

Now consider more particularly the'generalised form
of the linkage which corresponds to three-bar motion, of
which Watt's parallel motion (so-called) offers a simple
instance. If we were to revert to the old notion of link-
work we should say that a three-bar motion is obtained by
fixing one of the sides of a jointed quadrilateral of any
form ; but adhering to the more general conception of the
matter here set forth, we may describe it as resulting from
the fixation of any one of the planes of a quadriplane,
i.e. a system of four planes connected together by four
joints. Mr.^A. B. Kempe, who has brought to light
magnificent additions to Peaucellier's ever memorable
discovery of an exact parallel motion in a paper which
I have had the pleasure of presenting to the Royal
Society of London, in the course of conversation with
me made the very acute and interesting remark that
in an ordinary 3-bar motion, supposing the distance be-
tween the two fixed centres to be given, and the lengths of
the two radial arms and the connecting rod to be also given,
the order in which these three latter elements are arranged
will not affect the nature of the canonigraphs described.
Whichever of the three lengths is adopted as the length
of the connector and the remaining two as the lengths of
the radial arms, the very same system of curves will be
described in all three cases so far as regards their form:

every canonigram in the arrangement will have a canoni-
gram corresponding to it in each of the other arrange-
ments such that the corresponding curves described
will be similar and similarly placed—a most remark-
able, and, for the purposes of theory, an exceedingly im-
portant observation ; but, as Prof. Cayley observed, when
once stated, a self-evident deduction from the principle of
the ordinary pantigraph.t It therefore occurred to me
that a corresponding theorem ought to hold for all graphs
whatever—for plagiographs just as well as for canoni-
graphs; and by a very simple application of the general
double-algebra method of Versors, I found that this would
be the case, the only difference being that now the corre-
sponding graphs, instead of being similar and similarly
situated, would be similar but not similarly situated; in
other words, that the lines joining the centre of similitude
with the corresponding points, instead of coinciding in
direction, would make for each particular graph a constant
angle with each other. Thus I passed from the con-
ception of the common Pantigraph to that of the Quer-

p q coincided in direction with p r and s r with s q, P Q

at a constant angle; in a word, as the Plagiograph is to
the Pantigraph, so is the Sylvester-Kempe Inverter or

that this new reciprocator is to be consigned to the limbo
of barren mathematical generalities—very far from it; it

* I early noticed the analogy between M. Peaucellier's six-linked recipro-
cator and the primitive form of the pantigraphic proportipnator formed by
two parallelograms having an angle and the directions of its two containing
sides in common, also therefore consisting of six.links; and indeed pointed
out that, starting (to fix the ideas) from a negative Peaucellier-cell (such as
is in successful use in the Houses of Parliament for ventilating the brains
of our representative and hereditary legislators), we have only to unfix
the two interior links from the angles to which they are attached, and attach
them instead to two sides of the containing lozenge, so as to be parallel
to the other two sides; and we pass from a Reciprocator to the compara-
tively barren Proportionalor. Now as a Proportionator (the Pantigraph in
common use) exists with only four sides, it ought to have been inferred as
fairly probable that a Reciprocator also might be discovered having only
four sides, i.e. by analogy, the probable existence might have been inferred
of a Hart cell—the conua-parallelogram first imagined by Mr. Samuel
Roberts, but rediscovered and hugged with the affection of a supposed
original discoverer, and wanned into new and unsuspected uses, by its
foster-parent Mr. Hart. I shall have no difficulty in finding a generalisation
of the Peaucellier-cell standing to it in the same relation as the Quadruplane
does to the Hart-cell, and similarly for the Proportionator, so that we shall
have the fourfold proportion—Peaucellier-cell: Hart-cell: Quadruplanc:
New Peaucellier cell:: Old Pantigraph: Common Pantigraph : Plagiograph:
Oblique Old Pauligraph; but, except as completing a chain of analogies,
the last terms in each quatrain will probably not prove of any practical
importance.

t In the case of a 3-piece motion whose fundamental linkage (i.e. the
quadrilateral formed by the lines joining the pivots and the fixed poiuts in
their natural order of succession) is subject to tne condition that either the
two pairs of opposite sides or two pairs of contiguoussides are equal for each
pair, the Plamgraph (leaving out of account its circular portion) is the inverse
of a conic. In the first case (that of the contra-parallelogram) the position
of this node is seen immediately to be the opposite to the Planigram in respect
to the centre of the figure in its untwisted (if. parallclogrammatic) form In
the second case, that of the so-called kite-form, it was found to be far from
easy to determine its position. Even our Cayley did not {quite succeed in
determining it from the analytical equations, and it was reserved for M.
Manheim to deduce it geometrically by a most elegant but very elaborate
construction given in a paper inserted in the Proceedings of the Mathematical
Society of London. By the aid of the reciprocity established by me above
we pass at once from the case of the contra-parallelogram to that of the kite-

NATURE
CHARCOAL VACUA*
(From a Correspondent?)
PROF. DEWAR began his discourse by describing
the different processes which have been adopted for
obtaining very perfect vacua, and referred to a paper
regarding this matter, read by Prof. Tait and himself
before the Society last year.
By the ordinary air-pump the exhaustion can only be
obtained to j of an inch, i.e. :i„ of the ordinary pressure.
Regnault, in some of his experiments, after exhausting
with the air-pump, boiled water, and when the water had
evaporated, sealed the vessel, and then broke a flask
inside containing sulphuric acid, and so the water vapour
was absorbed.
Dr. Andrews' way is a revival of one due to Davy, viz. to
fill and exhaust twice with carbonic acid after the pump
exhaustion, and then by caustic potash to fix the C02
which is left.
Professors Tait and Dewa^s method is to take advan-
tage of the power charcoal has of condensing gases j
while the exhaustion, by means of a mercury pump,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
is going on, the charcoal is kept heated; when the
exhaustion has been carried as far as possible, the vessel
is sealed, and as the charcoal cools, it condenses the very
small residue of gas there may be present, and this can
again be temporarily driven out by heating the charcoal.
The test they have employed to gauge the perfection of
their vacuum has been to see if it will allow an electric
spark to pass. It is well known that at the ordinary
atmospheric density it requires considerable tension for a
spark to pass through air, and as the density diminishes,
the spark passes more easily ; but when a certain point is
reached the difficulty again increases, and in a very per-
fect vacuum no spark passes at all. Two wires, | inch
apart, in one of Tait and Dewar's exhausted tubes would
not allow a spark to pass, although a powerful coil was
employed.
Prof. Dewar went on to say that the effect of light and
heat had been tried by many experimenters, on magnets
and delicately suspended bodies, and in the Edinburgh
New Philosophical Joumaliot 1828 there is an interesting
account of some experiments performed by Mark Watt on
the same subject, with apparatus little differing in appear-
ance from that now used by Mr. Crookes.
Recently Mr. Crookes has found some curious results
which he seems to think are inexplicable. He found that
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the action of a beam of light on a delicately suspended glass
fibre with a disc at each end was repulsion of the disc when
the exhaustion was perfect, but attraction when at ordi-
nary pressures. The discs were light bodies of pith or cork.
One side of each was covered with lampblack, the other
was white. The first thing to be noticed is that the
blackened face is affected much sooner than the white face.
Since there was attraction at one density and repulsion
at another, it follows that at some intermediate density
there is no action at all, and this neutral point depends
among other things on the conductivity of the body and
the nature of the residual gas.
It will be seen that for delicate action one essential is
that the glass of the vessel be thin. The sensibility is
also found to increase with the perfection of the vacuum.
The first fact ascertained is that the action follows the
law of the inverse square of the distance, that which all
radiation obeys. Thus, when the light was 3-j inches from
the beam, the reading was 110, zero 22, deflection 88;
at 7\, reading 48, deflection 22, or only about £; and
when at 1 \\, reading 33; and,as zero changed, reading 33,

of the vessel is about a litre or 1000 cubic centimetres.
But since we know that the exhaustion has reduced the
density to nn>T3nr of its original, the volume occupied by
the residual gas at ordinary pressures would be that of a
little bubble tj^ of an inch in diameter.
Sir Wm. Thomson, T. Clerk-Maxwell, and Clausius have
shown that in agas, at ordinary pressure, themeanoraverage
path between two collisions is about Tufanr of a millimetre.
When tke pressure is reduced to ttfuwott the mean will be
400 millimetres, or about a foot and a half. What takes
place is this. The particles of the gas are flying about in
all directions, with a velocity which depends on the tem-
perature. When they impinge on the heated disc their
velocity is increased, they go off with a greater velocity
than those which go off from the colder side, and hence
there is a recoil of the disc. When the gas is at all dense
the particles get a very short way before they are met by
another and sent back, and so the velocity gets a common
velocity before any visible action takes place. When the
gas is rare the particles may get a long way off before they
meet others, and so the action becomes perceptible.

In case of cooling they go away with diminished ve-
locity and a negative recoil.
The author of the paper went on to show that the total
mechanical action on a square centimetre of black surface
derived from the radiation of a magnesium lamp, at a dis-
tance of 150 mill., did not exceed a continuous pressure of
¦fa part of a milligramme, and that the total work done
did not amount to the five-millionth part of the available
energy received by the movable surfaces.
ADDITION TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE
TERMITES*
FRITZ MULLER has recently published a short but
interesting memoir on the larvae of Calotermes,
a genus of Termites, which he describes with his wonted
care and accuracy. We cannot, of course, here follow
him in detail; but, as is so often the case in the writings
of this eminent naturalist, he draws our attention by his
descriptions to several points of unusual interest. As
occurs in some other insects, the youngest larvae of
Calotermes differ much in form from those somewhat
more advanced in age. The form of the younger larvae
may be accounted for on two hypotheses. It may be an
adaptation to the mode of life, or it may be the original
larval form of the group. In the latter case, Herr Miiller
considers that it would be an extremely interesting form,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
because, in his opinion, Calotermes is one of the oldest,
if not the oldest, of existing insect genera; since, accor-
ding to Hagen, the carboniferous Termites described by
Goldenburg from the cold strata belong to this group.
Under the latter hypothesis, therefore, the younger larvae of
Calotermes would have, as regards insects, an interest
similar to that possessed by Nauplius among Crustacea;
and, according to Miiller, the latter really is the case.
The youngest larvae of Calotermes live with their elder
sisters, in the same localities, on the same food, and, in fact,
under precisely the same conditions. These older larvae
have, in a word, completely adapted themselves to their
dwelling-place and mode of life. Like most animals
which burrow in earth, wood, or stone, they are cylindrical
in form. Not so the youngest larvae, which are flattened,
and have the thorax laterally expanded. Their structure
is, in Mutter's opinion, as unsuitable as possible for
animals inhabiting wood. This form is therefore pro-
bably only possessed through inheritance from far distant
ancestors.
It is unnecessary to point out how great is the interest

the effect of the rotation of the earth on great atmospheric currents,

tions, the polar being to the west of the other. Clearly the two
will have a tendency to recede from each other, and in conse-
quence there will be rarefaction at their neighbouring borders,
producing a reaction in the two currents exactly counterbalancing
the force due to rotation. Thus pressure diminishes from their
outer towards their inner or neighbouring borders, where there
must be a valley or depression of their surfaces. Since the
magnitude of this valley depends upon the velocity of the winds,
any slackening of velocity in one of them must allow it to break
into the other by gravitation, and originate a hurricane revolving
against the sun. It is the denser polar wind which generally
bleaks into the equatorial from a N. W. direction. Condensation
of vapour follows, and then under certain conditions a hurricane.
Now to take the other case—what will happen if the polar
current flows on the east of the equatorial? The effect of the
rotation of the eaith will be a heaping up or condensation of air
at their neighbouring borders, and the heavier current as before
will invade the lighter from S.E., bringing rain. Here, how-
ever, there can be no hurricane, for gravitation acts dispersively,
and the adjustment of level proceeds outwards instead of in-
wards. If it were possible for a hurricane to arise on the east

fused in the crushing?" 2. "If the work (of crushing) is equally
distributed throughout, why should not the heat be so also? or
if not, what determines the localisation?" In his reply Mr.
Mallet controverts the views of the Rev. O. Fisher by bringing
them into contact with acknowledged physical laws. He shows
that "crushing alone of rocky masses beneath our earth's crust
may be sufficient to produce fusion. He also shows that the
heat developed by crushing alone cannot be equally diffused
throughout the mass crushed, but must be localised, and that
the circumstances of this localisation must result in producing
a local temperature far greater than that due to crushing.
Lastly, he shows that after the highest temperatures have been
thus reached, a still further and great exaltation of tempera-
ture must arise from detrusive friction and the movements of
forcible deformation of the already crushed and heated material."
He therefore expresses his conviction that "there is no physical
difficulty in the conception involved in his original memoir (Phil.
Trans. 1873), '"" n°t there enlarged upon in detail, that the
temperatures consequent upon crushing the materials of our
earth's crust are sufficient locally to bring these into fusion."

On the formation of the Polar Ice-cap, by Mr. J. J. Murphy.
The present paper is intended by the author to supplement a
previous one read before the Society in 1869 (Q. J. G. S., vol.
xxv. p. 350), in which he gave reasons for differing from Mr.
Croll in thinking that the glacial climate was one of intense cold,
and held, on the contrary, that it was one of snowy winters and
cold summers, with a small range of temperature. Mr. Camp-
bell, in a paper read before the Society in 1874, gave the follow-
ing as the southernmost limits of the polar ice-cap, viz. :—In
Eastern Europe, lat. 56° N. ; in Germany, 550; in Britain, nearly
50°; in America, 390. This the author considers as strong but
not new evidence against the theory ot ice-cap extending to low
latitudes; the extent of the ice-cap would of course not be so
wide as that of the limits of glaciation, owing to the floating ice
approaching nearer the equator. After commenting on Mr.
Belt's remarks made during the discussion of Mr. Campbell's
paper, the author states that he attributes the presence of the

boulders found in the valley of the Amazon to icebergs which
had drifted further than usual. The glaciation of the tropics
would imply the glaciation of the whole world, which appears
no more possible than that the whole world was submerged at
one time. The author concludes with some remarks on a recent
paper of Mr. Tylor's.
Notes on the Gasteropoda of the Guelph Formation of Canada,
by Prof. II. Alleyne Nicholson, D.Sc, F.R.S.E. The author
notices the occurrence of the Guelph formation as a subdivision
of the Niagara series in Canada and the United States, and
describes it as consisting everywhere of a cellular, yellowish, or
cream-coloured dolomitic limestone of rough texture and crys-
talline aspect, containing innumerable cavities from which fossils
of various kinds have been dissolved out. In this paper the
author describes all the known Gasteropoda of the Guelph for-
mation in Canada, including the following previously described
species:—Aturchisonia Loganii(Hall), At. turritiformis (Hall),
At. macrospira (Hall), At. Invittata (Hall), At. longispira (Hall),
At. vilellia (Billings), At. Hercyna (Billings), Cyclonema? ele-
vata (Hall), Holopea giulphcnsis (Billings), H. gracia (Billings),
Subulitcs ventricosus (Hall), and Plcurotomaria solarioidts (Hall).
As new species he describes Aturchisonia Boylci, distinguished
from At. turritiformis (Hall) and At. estella (Billings) by its more
rapid rate of expansion, its apparently canaliculated suture, and
the existence of an angular band a little above the suture; and

whorls are convex, but the body-whorl is obtusely angulated
at about its upper fourth. Uncertain species of Aturchisonia
and Plcurotomaria are also indicated.
Description of a new genus of Tabulate Coral, by Mr. G. J.
Hinde. The coral described by the author as constituting a
new genus of Favoiitidae, for which he proposes the name of
Sp/uerolitcs, has a massive Iree corallum consisting of minute,
polygonal, closely united corallites, growing in all directions
lrom a central point, forming a spheroidal body, the entire sur-
face of which is occupied by the calices of the corallites. The
walls of the corallites are very delicate, with numerous pores;
the tabula; are incomplete,formed by delicate arched lamella;, and
there are no septa. From Chcctetes this genus is distinguished
by the perforated walls and incomplete arched tabula;; from
Favosilcs it differs in its mode of growth and its incomplete
tabula;; and from Atichilinia it is separated by the minuteness
of its corallites, and the absence of epitheca and of septal stria:.

hitherto been devised, he stated that the new apparatus consists
essentially of an electro-magnet with shoes forming a groove, in
which a Siemens' armature is made to revolve. It differs from
the original machines made by Siemens and Wheatstone in the
commutator, as two springs conduct the current from the cylin-
drical insulator, to which are attached three pieces of metal,
one surrounding it for three-quarters of its 'circumference, the
second for one quarter, and between these is a ring con-
nected with the insulated end of the wire from the arma-
ture, and bearing two pieces of metal which are so arranged
as to complete the circles of the outer pieces of metal. The
armature is so constructed that a stream of water may be con-
stantly passed through it. A small machine constructed on this
principle, which without its driving gear weighs 26 Ibs., is
capable of raising 8 inches of platinum wire 8 inches long and
•005 inches in diameter to a red heat.—Dr. Stone then adjourned

THE LIFE OF LANGUAGE
The Life and Growth of Language. By William Dwight
Whitney, Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philo-
logy in Yale College. The "International Scientific
Series," voL xvi. (London : King and Co., 1875.)
THIS is certainly a disappointing volume. When the
editors of the International Scientific Series offered
us a treatise on Language by the side of such works as
Tyndall's "Forms of Water in Clouds and Rivers,"
Bagehot's "Physics and Politics," Bain's "Mind and
Body," Spencer's "Study of Sociology," we had a right
to expect something substantial, if not original. Instead
of this, Prof. Whitney presents us with what is to all
intents and purposes an abstract of his " Lectures on the
Study of Language," delivered in 1864 in Washington
and other places, lectures which in themselves contained
hardly more than a popular summary of some of the
results obtained by the researches of German, French,
and English scholars on the origin, the development, and
the classification of languages. "The old story," to let
Prof. Whitney speak for himself, "is told in a new way,

under changed aspects and with changed proportions,
and with considerably less fullness of exposition and
illustration." But why simply tell us the old story over
again? Has the science of language made no progress
since 1864? Has Prof. Whitney himself worked up no
new materials? Has he no discovery of his own to
record in his own special fields of labour? Has he
brought none of the problems which, as he told us in
1864, still perplexed the students of the science of
language, nearer to a solution? Or, at all events, has
he not found some more felicitous illustrations than those
with which he entertained his hearers ten years ago? If
any one who knows the Professor's lectures, should read
his new treatise on what he strangely calls the " Life and
Growth of Language," we doubt not which of the two
volumes he will keep on the shelves of his library, and
which he will assign to the corner of ephemeral litera.
ture. Prof. Whitney has set forth his good wine at the
beginning, and gives us now that which is worse. To
judge from other numbers of the International Series, the
rules imposed on the contributors do not seem to have
prevented them from treating their subjects in a thorough,if
not in an exhaustive way. Besides, there are in this volume
several lengthy discussions as to whether the science
of language should be called a physical or an historical

science, whether it deserves the name of a science at all,
whether a knowledge of psychology is essential to the
student of language or not; discussions which, as far as
we are able to judge, contain an " infinite deal of nothing,"
and add very little to what had already been written on
these subjects.
In one respect, however, we have to congratulate
Prof. Whitney most warmly on a great improvement
in these his second and more sober thoughts. From
beginning to end his new book is free from spite and
personal invective. Neither Humboldt, nor Bopp, nor
Renan, nor Schleicher, nor Bleeck, nor Steinthal, nor
Goldstiicker are held up to ridicule as ignorant of the

discoverer. That Sanskrit asti is the same as Latin est,
that Sanskrit trayas coincided with Latin ires, was pro-
bably seen by every scholar who ever opened a Sanskrit
grammar. In such cases it can be merely a matter of
historical interest to find out who was the first lucky
observer. It seems to us one of the chief merits, for
instance, of Curtius's Principles of Greek Etymology, that
he tells us in most cases, with the greatest conscientious-
ness, who were the scholars that first proposed or after-
wards defended and substantiated the etymology of
different words. Such references involved, no doubt,
considerable trouble, and we have no right to expect in a
popular work the same learned apparatus. But there are
limits here as everywhere else, which no one can overstep
with impunity. Every writer, unless his memory is
growing weak, knows perfectly well what comes out of his
brain, and what comes out of his pockets; what he has
found out himself by dint of hard work, and what he has
simply borrowed from others. A large array of footnotes
and references may be in many cases a mere pedantic
display of learning, but to omit all indications of sources

and authorities is hardly defensible, nor can it be excused
on the ground of " the compendious cast" in a book where
we find, on the second page, references to two of Prof.
Whitney's own writings. This is really not a matter of
sentiment only, but a matter of serious import in the
world of letters. Dates are easily forgotten, and of late
it has happened several times that one writer has actually
been blamed for having borrowed from another without
acknowledgment, whereas he was the creditor and the other
the debtor. This leads to awkward explanations, some-
times to angry controversies, all of which can be avoided
by a frank compliance with rules long recognised in the
republic of letters.
If we confine ourselves to some of the principal subjects
treated in Prof. Whitney's new work, would it not have
been interesting to know who first pointed out the two
motive powers in the growth of language on which Prof.
Whitney dwells so largely—Phonetic Decay, and Dialectic
Grou'th or Variation?
Again, when an intelligible and sufficient cause was
wanted for what was vaguely and metaphorically called
Phonetic Decay, who was it that first ventured to suggest
that there was nothing mysterious in that process,
and that it could be explained in a very homely way
as the result of laziness, or of economy of muscular

energy?
There is one question which Prof. Whitney has treated
more fully in this than in his former work, viz., the true
meaning of dialect, and the relation between dialects and
languages. He exhibits most ably the inevitability of
dialectic variety in the very beginning of human speech,
and the gradual elimination of dialectic forms in the
later growth of language. Were there not others who
had strongly insisted on the dialectic nature inherent in
language, and had borne the brunt of the battle against
numerous unbelievers?
We still remember the time when the leading philo-
logists in Germany protested against the introduction
of scientific Phonetics into Comparative Philology. If
at present phonetic and physiological discussions form
the introduction and groundwork to every treatise on
Comparative Philology, is it not well to remember the
names of those who were once ridiculed as the founders
of the Fonttik Nuz f

of sapient philosophy," Prof. Whitney solves the whole
question on the first page. We must again quote his
own words:—
"There can be asked, respecting language, no other
question of a more elementary and at the same
time of a more fundamentally important character
than this: How is language obtained by us? how does
each speaking individual become possessed of his speech?
Its true answer involves and determines well-nigh the
whole of linguistic philosophy. There are probably few
who would not at once reply that we learn our language;
it is taught us by those among whom our lot is cast in
childhood. And this obvious and common-sense answer
is also, as we shall find on a more careful and considerate
inquiry, the correct one."
This third discovery, too, will hardly meet with any
objections. Prof. Whitney says, indeed, that two different
answers are conceivable, viz., that language is inherited
as a race-character, like colour, or that it is independently
produced by each individual; but though we do not deny
the conceivableness of such propositions, we doubt
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
whether any being endowed with the gift of language
ever made them, and whether they required " the crushing
weight of facts " which Prof. Whitney brings out against
them. We do not blame an author, who for argument's
sake sets up what in German is called a Strohmann, in
Sanskrit' a Purvapaksha; but when we read on p. 145,
"There are those still who hold that words get themselves
attributed to things by a kind of mysterious natural pro-
cess, in which we have no part ; that there are organic
forces in speech itself, which by fermentation, or digestion,
or crystallisation, or something of the sort, produce new
material and alter old," Prof. Whitney would appear to
have allowed himself to be carried away a little too far
by his dramatic imagination.
To most people, however, be they scholars or philo-
sophers, it would seem that to be told that a child learns
his language from his mother, does not help them very
much towards a real insight into the origin of language.
We should go on from child to mother, from mother to
grandmother, and so forth, but this retrogression in
infiniium would land us exactly at the same point from
which we started, viz., How did the first mother get her
language? Let us hear what Prof. Whitney has to say in
answer to this ever-recurring question. He tells us to
look around us and to see what takes place at present.

Thus, after explaining the recent discovery of a new tar
colour, which by its discoverer was called magenta, he
says :—" The word magenta is just as real and legitimate
a part of the English language as green, though vastly
younger and less important ; and those who acquire and
use the latter do so in precisely the same manner as the
former, and generally with equal ignorance and unconcern
as to its origin." And again, after referring to the wholly
arbitrary formation of the word gas by Van Helmont in
A.D. 1600, Prof. Whitney writes :—" We cannot follow so
clearly toward or to its source the word green, because it
is vastly older ; but we do seem to arrive by inference at
a connection of it with our word grow, and at seeing that
a green thing was named from its being a growing thing;
and this is a matter of no small interest as bearing on the
history of the word."
Here then we have arrived at last at what Prof. Whitney
would call the pivotal fact. The word green and all
other words were made in the same way in which Van
Helmont made the word gas, and the inventor of aniline
colours the word magenta. Green was made from to grow.

sentiment, whether conservative or liberal, but from a
thorough appreciation of the weight 6f conflicting evidence.
Crawfurd and others notwithstanding, Prof. Whitney
assures us that the Malayan, the Polynesian, and the Me-
lanesian languages may henceforth be safely treated as one
family, as more closely related, therefore, than Mongolic
and Tartaric. One more instance. The Annamese or
Cochin Chinese, the Siamese, and the Burmese, whatever
their differences, are all alike, we are told, in the capital
point, that they are uninflected, and this cannot but be re-
garded as a strong indication of ultimate relationship.
Provisionally, therefore, they are to be classed together as
the South-eastern Asiatic, or Monosyllabic Family. All we
can say at present is that we hope this is the classifica-
tion of knowledge, and not of ignorance, and that we shall
soon have the pieces justificative!, particularly with regard
to the Burmese and Siamese. Some new light may also
be expected from Prof. Whitney with regard to Chinese,

B.C., whatever sceptics may say to the contrary. On all
these points our expectations are raised to the highest

pitch, and we hope that the professor will soon find
leisure to give us not only his conclusions, but the facts
on which they are founded. As we said in the be-
ginning, we are disappointed by his present book; we
are quite willing, however, to look upon it as a promisej
and we have no doubt that the American scholar wil
soon redeem the pledges which he has given, and thus not
only relieve the science of language from "the incon-
gruities and absurdities " of English, German, and French
scholars, but enrich it by truly original American dis-
coveries.
We may point out a few of the'^inaccuracies as to
matters of fact which struck us in the Professor's new
book.
Prof. Whitney thinks that green may be derived from
to grow. Is not the root really HAR, and the transition
of meaning, to be bright, to be green, to grow (griinen)?

The derivation of luna from litcna (p. 83) is no longer
tenable, because we have to take into account the dialectic
form lostta, presupposing an original loux-na as in illus.
tris for inluxlris.
On p. 215, in discussing words like brother and sister,
bull and cow, ram and ewe, Prof. Whitney says: "Man
in its distinctive sense indicates a male animal, and we
have a different word, woman, for a female of the same
kind." The choice of the illustration is not quite happy,
considering that woman, as is well known to Prof.
Whitney, is only a corruption of wif-man.

flexibility; the collar itself being furnished with similar
but two-armed bodies.
The use of these bladders is not merely, like the air-
bladders of Fucus, to support the plant in the water; they
are employed to capture small aquatic insects and other
animals, which they do on a large scale. What it is that
attracts the animals to enter the bladders is at present
unknown ; but, having once entered by pressing down the
valve, escape is almost impossible ; they sometimes get
closely wedged between the valve and the collar, and thus
miserably perish. But the most mysterious part of the
structure of Utricularia is that this beautiful and compli-
cated arrangement for capturing prey is not accompanied
by any correspondingly perfect arrangement for its diges-
tion. No secretion whatever has been observed to exude
from either the glands or the quadrifid processes ; pieces
of meat and albumen inserted within the bladders re-
mained absolutely unchanged for three days; and it is
only when the bodies of the captured animals begin to
decay that the products of decomposition are slowly
absorbed by the quadrifid processes; and of even this

fact the evidence can only be said to be indirect, depend-
ing on a change observed in the appearance of the proto-
plasmic contents of the cells of the quadrifids and of the
glands on the valve and bifids on the collar, similar to
that which takes place in the tentacles of Droscra during
digestion.
The above description is taken from the rare Utricu-
laria ncglecta, the species first observed by Mr. Darwin;
the phenomena are essentially the same in the other
British forms. An epiphytic South American species,
U. montana, bears bladders of a similar structure in all
essential points, which capture a quantity of minute
animals. This species is also furnished on its rhizomes
with a number of small tubers, which appear to serve as
reservoirs of water during the dry season. Several other
species were examined, including the Brazilian U. nelum-
bi/olia, found only in a very remarkable habitat, floating
on the water which collects in the bottom of the leaves of
a large Tillandsia that inhabits abundantly an arid rocky
part of the Organ Mountains at an elevation of about
5,000 feet above the level of the sea. In addition to the
ordinary propagation by seed, this plant is said to put out
runners which are "always found directing themselves
towards the nearest Tillandsia, when they insert their
points into the water and give origin to a new plant,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which in its turn sends out another shoot."
It is very curious and suggestive to compare and con-
trast the contrivances displayed in the two genera,
Pinguicula and Utricularia, belonging to the same
natural order. In the latter case we have a most elabo-
rate and perfect contrivance for capturing insects, remind-
ing one of what Mr. Darwin describes elsewhere as
"transcending in an incomparable degree the contri-
vances and adaptations which the most fertile imagination
of the most imaginative man could suggest;" but, when
the insects are once captured, there is no contrivance for
hastening the decay of their tissues, or anything com-
parable to animal digestion. In Pinguicula, on the other
hand, the digestive apparatus is most complete; but
there is no means whatever of capturing insects, except
the very perfectness of the digestive substance itself, the
extremely viscid nature of the secretion from the glands.
What was the primitive form which has developed into
such very diverse structures in these nearly-allied genera?

OUR readers are no doubt aware that a large area of
the Western States of America is overrun by a number of
expeditions intended mainly for the topographical and
geological survey of that immense region. Some idea of
the number and constitution of these parties will be
obtained from two articles in Nature, vol. viii. pp. 331
and 385. The " Progress-Report " for 1872 of that under
charge of Lieut. G. M. Wheeler contains only brief notes
of the work done by the various parties; detailed reports
will, no doubt, be published eventually, and will occupy
several volumes, besides atlases. The present brief report
comprises notes of work done, not only in geology and
topography, but also in astronomy, meteorology, natural

history, ethnology, and photography. Some idea of the
amount of work done may be obtained from the fact that
the areas covered topographically during the summer
months of 1872 exceeded 50,000 square miles lying in
LTtah, Nevada, and Arizona. The length of lines in the
vicinity of which surveys were made is 6,127 miles, in
addition to which other 2,067 miles had to be travelled
for various purposes. A large portion of the present pub-
lication is occupied with reports on the numerous mining-
stations which have been established in the district
surveyed, as also on irrigation, agriculture, routes of com-
munication, timber lands, and Indians ; from the latter
the expedition met with no interference, though of course
it was accompanied by a military escort. One of the
principal features of this report are the lithographic illus-
trations from camera-negatives of some of the magnificent
canons on the Colorado River; one of these illustrations
gives a fine idea of a rain-sculptured rock at Salt-Creek

If the instrument has been so used please to correct me.
Otherwise permit me to say for myself, that being in Paris on
Wednesday July 7, when the great physical and astronomical
mathematician of the age, M. Leverrier, stood up in his place in
the Academy of Sciences to explain how it had come about that
the official predicter of the weather in the Obscrvatoire had
announced a fine dry period just before the destructive inunda-
tions in the South of France with all their train of frightful
national calamities began,—I paid attention to the conclusion of
his speech, which wound up with announcing "that all the bad
symptoms had now (July 7) passed away, that the barometer
was high in England, and that all the probabilities united
pointed to a fine time coming."
Every day after that for a week the weather only became
worse and worse, darker and wetter, in the usually gay city
of Paris; and then I transferred myself to London, and
was there on the I4th, isth, and part of the i6th of July, a
witness to, if possible, still worse weather, growing darker and
wetter all the time. So much, then, for the failure of the ordi-
nary methods of prediction, even in able hands; and let us
be lenient to them, for who would or could have expected such

deluges of rain with a high barometer, and in the month of
July?
Now, however, comes an indication of where the spectroscope
seems capable of saying something meteorologically useful: for
in all that dark and wet weather in London a pocket spectro-
scope showed me from every part of the sky a broad dark band
on the less refrangible side of D, and partly in the place of it.
This band was so intense as to be the chief feature of the whole
spectrum; and though no doubt "telluric" in its origin, was
very different from the standard telluric effects seen at sunset in
ordinary weather.
I feared at the time that this grandly dark spectral band might
be of base artificial origin, such as an absorption effect by London
smoke ; and when journeying northward by rail on July 16, it
was certainly charming to find that in proportion as we left
London the rain ceased, the dark spectral band decreased, the
clouds (amongst which, by the way, there were some remarkable
counter-motions chiefly from north to south) diminished, and by
the time we reached York fine weather prevailed. The ground
there was dry, the rivers low, and the sky spectrum not only
presented no dull bands, but the true D line was seen exquisitely
fine and neat, as the thinnest imaginable spider-line in a tele-
scope's illuminated field: so thin, fine, and clear indeed, as to
offer a delight to the eye, such as none but an earnest spectro-
scopist can have any idea of.

Thus far, it is true, we have only had dark nebulous bands in
place of fine sharp lines as accompaniments of rain, London rain
too, with a high and steady barometer in the pleasant month of
July. But mark, if you please, what follows.
The morning of the I7th of July, in Edinburgh, was glorious
with pure blue sky, transparent atmosphere, delicious tempera-
ture, and light N.E. Wind. So, too, it continued all the day
through, to the delight of thousands upon thousands in the
streets. No smoke either was issuing from any of the factory
chimneys, for there was a half-holiday or something more, and
the usually working population was enjoying itself in the open
air. The only clouds were a few brilliant and picturesque cur-
rents along the northern horizon, giving something like Alpine
mountain snowy tops to the lovely undulations of the Scottish
hills.
Simply beautiful were those bright cloud forms as an artistic
feature in the general landscape; but in the spectroscope—why,
good gracious! I could only say, what is the meaning of this?
It was only a little pocket spectroscope, remember, without
scale, and with small dispersion; but there was the D line ap-

date June 8 :—" I last night examined its place and found
the star in question to be barely visible in an opera glass

Measures, properly so called, he found were hardly
feasible, owing to the extreme faintness of the cusps and
proximity of the planet to the sun, but estimations with a
position-wire in the field of view were made on six days
at distances varying from 3° 26' to 70 37'; [the mean

appears) seen as a very delicate luminous ring. The
cusps of the crescent, as the planet approached the sun,
had extended beyond a semicircle, until they at length
coalesced and formed a perfect ring of light." Last
December Prof. Lyman repeated these observations,
making use of a five-feet Clarke telescope of 4!-; inches

Let us now turn from what the Siamese have done for
science to what they are going to do.
The King has instructed Dr. Gowan to erect an obser-
vatory in which regular barometric and thermometric
measurements are to be made. The rainfall and the
tides will also form a subject of measurements. Other
instruments will be added in time. As the Siamese have
a great fancy for photography, we shall perhaps soon
see regular photographs of the sun taken in Bangkok.
Various spectroscopes and telescopes are at the present

intended to build a chemical laboratory in the palace.
The King's bodyguard are being instructed by Mr.
Alabaster in taking surveys. At the moment I write this,
they are out on a surveying expedition.
All this shows that the inhabitants of Siam have a great
fancy for science, if it does not show more. Strong liking
for a subject is generally accompanied with, if not caused
by, the ability to deal with it and to overcome its difficulties.

Let us hope that some of the Siamese will take up their
favourite subject, not as amateurs merely, but with all the
seriousness of a profession. Many of them visit Europe
for several years. If some of these were to go through a

their natural intelligence and love of science, would soon
make them good observers and able experimenters.
In the meantime it will be interesting to watch the
growth and development of a country in which science is
the recognised and favourite study. English men of

appeared out of season, but it came in a different form
from anything within the memory, of the younger bota-
nists of the present generation. It is considered probable

that the present condition of the disease is similar with
that long ago known as "the curl," a pest known a con-
siderable time before Pcronospora infcsfans, Mont., was
described as European.
At the beginning of June I had potato-leaves sent to
me for examination from the office of the Jountal of
Horticulture; these leaves were badly diseased, spotted
and fcctid, and from certain of the stomata a few threads
of the Pcronospora were emerging; this fact, from the
unusually early appearance of the fungus, I made a
special note of.
On June 16 Mr. Berkeley brought leaves sent to him
for examination by Mr. Andrew Murray, (which were
spotted in an exactly similar manner with mine), to the

ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE THERMOMETER
AND PYROMETER*
HIS paper consUts of three parts. The first treats of the
experiments made by Dr. Siemens, with a view of deter-
mining the law of the variation of electrical resistance in metallic
conductors, with variation of temperature, through a greater
range than had been before attempted. The second describes
certain instruments, by whose use this law is applied to the
measurement of temperature. The third treats of a simple
method of measuring electrical resistance by means of the
differential voltameter.
Our author first refers to the previous experiments made by
Amsted, by his brother, Dr. Werner Siemens, and by Dr.
Matthietsen, and to the law deduced by Clausius, "that the
electrical resistances of metals are directly proportional to their
absolute temperatures." The maximum range of these experi-
ments was ioo°C. Dr. Sicmens's experiments were made upon
copper, iron, steel, silver, aluminium, and platinum ; the last of
these has received the most attention at his hands, as, having the
highest melting point, it is the most valuable-from a practical

point of view.
The method employed in one series of experiments was to
wind metal wire upon pipe-clay cylinders, having helical grooves
to prevent contact between the convolutions of the wire, and to
place these, together with three delicate thermometers, in a
copper vessel enclosed in a larger one
containing linseed oil, and having
hollow sides packed with sand to
diminish sudden variation of tempera-
ture. The bath was gradually heated
by means of Bunsen's burners to 340°
C., or close to the boiling point of
mercury, and the readings were made
with a Wheatstone's bridge and deli-
cate galvanometer. A second series
of experiments was made in a heated
air vessel having a metallic screen to
prevent irregular Itsses of heat by
radiation or by atmospheric currents,
tlie other conditions being similar to
those in the first series. The results
obtained were found to accord gene-
rally with those of Matthiessen andtl:e

their experiments, but pointed to a

limits. The formula hitherto known
as Matthiessen's is—
K = ^' -

and was the mean of the results ob-
tained on various metals. This for-
mula is shown to give discordant
results at the higher temperatures, as
the calculated resistance at 300° C.
is I-61 nearly of wh:t it is at o° C, whilst at 2000° C. it is '0373,
showing clearly that the formula is reliable only between very
narrow limits.
We quote the author as to the law of resistance which he pro-
poses: "Now, if we apply the mechanical laws of work and
velocity to the vibratory motions of a body which represent its
free heat, we should define this heat as directly proportional to
the square of the velocity with which the atoms, or may be the
molecules, vibrate.

body offers to the passage of an electrical impulse from atom to

up to the boiling-point of the latter metal, results at higher tem-
peratures were obtained. The first part concludes with several
pages of tabulated results of experiments, which results are laid
down in a sheet of diagrams.
In the second part, Dr. Siemens describes the instruments he
has designed for the measurement of temperature by electrical
resistance, having first referred to the coils of silk-covered copper
wire, by which he was enabled to detect a dangerous rise of tem-
perature in the Malta and Alexandria Telegraph cable, coiled in
ship's hold, and saved that cable from being destroyed. The
simplest of these arrangements is shown in Fig. 2, and is em-
ployed for the measurement of temperature not exceeding
the boiling point of water. Insulated wire is wound round a
cylindrical piece of wood and is enclosed in a metal casing : one
end is joined to a thicker insulated wire, and the other to a
similar one soldered to it; this is called the thermometric
resistance coil or thermometer coil. The thermometrical com-
parison coil is formed of an exactly similar wire, and has an
equal resistance with the other. The wire is wound upon a
metal tube, and is enclosed in a protecting capsule of metal, in
the open end of which is fitted a vulcanite stopper through which

are passed the leading wires attached to the coil. This is placed
in a movable tube having a flanged bottom and containing a
mercury thermometer; the tube is immersed in a cylindrical
vessel of water, wherein it is moved up and down, the flange
agitating and thus equalising the temperature of the water.
The thermometer coil, which may be at a distance from the
place of observation, is connected with the comparison coil
through a pair of equal resistances and a galvanometer. When
electrical equilibrium is obtained, by adding hot or cold water to
the vessel containing the comparison coil until the galvanometer

piece of india-rubber tubing, which, after being padded outside
with hemp yarn, is lashed tightly with a stout binding wire.
The gutta-percha covered wire is placed between the india-rubber
pipes b and (, its end being soldered to one of the leading wires,
the other leading wire being soldered to the brass tube. The
while is carried at the end.of the sounding line, which contains
the leading wires. These coils aie tested under hydrostatic
pressure, and accurate readings are obtained to a tenth of a.
degree Fahrenheit.
The only difficulty that has hitherto arisen in the employment
of this instrument has been the obtaining of skilled observers to
note with accuracy the indications of the galvanoscope on board
ship.
The next instrument described is the electrical pyrometer, the
coil of which is made of platinum wire, wound on a hard baked

THE same number of this Journal contains the continuation
of Dr. Chavanne's valuable paper on the condition of the ice in
the polar seas and the periodical changes to which it is subject.
This paper is the result of a minute and careful examination of
the reports of the most trustworthy observers, and contains two
valuable tables, one showing the normal value of the winter and
summer temperatures in fifteen of the principal polar basin?, and
the other the variation from the normal mean temperatures in
summer and winter of the same basins for the period 1800-74.

became identified with them in every respect. He is recovering
rapidly the use of his mother-tongue both in speaking, reading,
and writing, though he still retains some marked characteristics
of savage life. He has given much information concerning the
ribe among whom he lived so long; their language does not
seem to have anything in common with the Malay or with any
of the Papuan dialects. If judiciously treated, Narcisse might
be made to yield valuable material to the anthropologist.

lies between the forty-r.inth and Hfiy-fi/th parallels, and extends
from the base of the Rocky Mountains to a ridge of Laurentian
rocks that runs north-west from Lake Superior towards the
Arctic Sea, and is called by the author the "Laurentian axis."
This plateau is crossed by two watersheds; one, starting from
the base of the Rocky Mountains at about the forty-ninth parallel,
runs due east to the Io5th meridian, when it turns to the south-
east, dividing the Red River from the Missouri; the other
crosses from the Rocky Mountains to the Laurentian axis near
the fifty-fifth parallel. The whole region between these two
transverse watersheds slopes gradually eastward, but is divisible
into three prairie steppes or plateaus of different elevations. The
lowest includes Lake Winnipeg and the valley of the Red River;
ils average altitude is Soo feet. The second, or the "Great
Plains," properly so called, has an average elevation of 1,600
feet. The third or highest is from 2,500 to 4,200 feet above the
sea, and is not so level as the other two.
Glacial Phenomena of the Laurentian Axis.—The neighbour-
hood of the Lake of the Woods is taken by the author as fur-
nishing an example of the glaciation visible in many parts of ihe
Laurentian axis. This lake is seventy miles long, and has a
coast line of three hundred or four hundred miles. The details

of its outline closely follow the character of the rock, spreading
out over the schistose and thinly cleavable varieties, and becom-
ing narrow and tortuous where compact dioritic rocks, green-
stone, conglomerate, and gneiss prevail. The rocks both on the
shores and the islands in the lake are rounded, grooved, and
striated. The direction of the strkc is from north-east to south-
west.
Drift Plateau of Northern Minnesota and Eastern Manitoba.—
This plateau consists of a great thickness of drill deposits resting
on the gently sloping foot of the Laurentian, and is composed
to a depth of sixty leet or more of fine sands and arenaceous
clays, with occasional beds of gravel and small boulders, pro-
bably reposing throughout on boulder-clay. The only fossil
found was a piece of wood apparently ot the common cedar
(Thuja occidentalism. The surface of the plateau is strewn with
large erratics, derived chiefly from the Laurentian and Huronian
to the north; but there are also many of white limestone. The
fossils in some of the latter being of Upper Silurian age, the
author is inclined to believe, with Dr. Bigsby, that an outcrop
of Upper Silurian is concealed by the drift deposits in the Lake
of the Woods region.
Lowest Prairie Lfi'd ami Valley of the Red River.—This prairie
presents an appearance of perfect horizontality. The soil con-
sists of fine silty deposits arranged in thin horizontal beds resting
on till or boulder-clay. Stones were exceedingly rare. The

western escarpment was terraced and covered with boulders.
It is therefore probable that this prairie is the bed of a pre-glacial
lake.
The Second prairie Plateau is thickly covered with drift de-
posits, which consist in great part of local debris derived from the
underlying soft formations, mixed with a considerable quantity
of transported material, especially in the upper layers. Large
erratics are in places abundant ; they consist mainly of Lauren-
tian rocks, but Silurian limestone also abounds. The following
is the percentage of the boulders from the different formations
present in the drift:—Laurentian, 28'49; Huronian, 971;
Limestone, 54'OI ; QuarUite Drift, 1-14. The last is derived
from the Rocky Mountains, the other three from the Laurentian
axis. There are also on the surface of this plateau some re-
markable elevated regions, apparently entirely composed of
accumulated drift materials.
Ed%t of the. Third Prairie Plateau, or the Missouri Cottau, is
a mass of glacial debris and travelled blocks averaging from
thirty to forty miles in breadth, and extending diagonally across
the country lor a distance of about 800 miles.

the bee itself.—Mr. Champion exhibited a series of recently
captured individuals of Chryiomela cirtalis, from Snowdon, its
only known British locality. Mr. M'Lachlan stated that he had
recently seen this species in the Department ol Saone-et-Loire,

of its sole habitat in Britain.—The Secretary exhibited nests
of a trap-door spider, sent from Uitenhage, near Port Eliza-
beth, Cape Colony. The nests were not (as is usual) in

"trap-door " appeared to be formed of a portion of the bark,
thus rendering it most difficult to detect the nests when in
a closed condition.—Mr. Charles V. Riley, State Entomologist
of Missouri, exhibited sundry insect pests that do so much

impuncia), and the Rocky Mountain Locus'. (Caloptenns spretus),

and the vast amount of destitution caused by it; stating that in

PRACTICAL PHYSICS
WE propose in the present article to carry out the
intention expressed in a former number (vol.
xii. p. 206) of giving fuller details of the practical in-
struction in physics, which forms a part of the summer
course of instruction given to science teachers by the
Science and Art Department. The teaching of prac-
tical physics presents several difficulties, which have
no doubt largely militated against its general intro-
duction into the course of scientific education. It
has not yet been systematised. Unlike practical che-
mistry one cannot select a practical text-book on
physics and give it to the students; for such text-books
do not yet exist in English. We arc not forgetting the
translation of Weinhold's Experimental Physics, which
we lately reviewed in these columns; but that book is
unsuitable for most students owing to its unwieldy size
and high price.
Even if works on practical physics were at hand,
another difficulty is encountered in the costly nature of
the apparatus involved in studying physics. This no doubt
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
is one of the main difficulties that the teacher has to over-
come, and in this respect physics differs widely from che-
mistry, for it is out of the question to provide a complete
set of physical apparatus for every two or three students.
To meet this difficulty one may distribute different in-
struments among the students and allow them in turn
thoroughly to master what is put before them. This plan
might do for a small class, the members of which could
use their fingers already. But it is at best an unsatis-
factory method, for it leaves the student completely at sea
directly he begins to communicate the instruction he has
received, unless he can purchase what he has been in the
habit of using, and this is not often within his means to
do. Another course is first to teach the students how to
make simple apparatus for themselves, and then to show
them how to use it. The advantages of this plan are
apparent. Students unaccustomed to manipulation find
to their astonishment, when they begin, that all their
fingers have turned into thumbs, and are amazed at their
clumsiness and stupidity. Very soon, however, fingers
begin to reappear, and the first successful piece of appa-
ratus that is made gives them a confidence in themselves
which they had thought impossible to attain. The plea-
sure of having made an instrument is increased a hundred-
fold when it is found that by their own handiwork they
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
may verify some of the more important laws in physics;
or make physical determinations, which before they would
have considered it presumption to attempt, even with
ready purchased apparatus. In order to carry out this
plan successfully, minutely detailed instructions must be
given to each student concerning the construction of
the apparatus he has to make, and it is moreover obvious
that the instruments should not take too long to make,
and that the first trials should be with the simplest appa-
ratus possible.
Let us now look at the science teachers at work at
South Kensington. Each one has given to him a page
of printed instructions for the day's work. These instruc-
VOL, xii.—No. 300
tions have grown up within the hist few years under the
direction of those who have been associated with Dr.
Guthrie in this undertaking, namely, Professors G. C.
Foster and W. F. Barrett, together with the valuable aid
of Mr. W. J. Wilson.

lends itself more readily to practical work than Electricity

the galvanometer. Bend stout brass wire into flat-topped
arch and fix firmly in block ; the straight portion of wire
at top of arch having upon it a cork roller for raising or
lowering needles. Magnetise two sewing needles and fix

upper needle, fix glass thread about 4 inches long to serve
as pointer. Suspend needles by silk fibre and attach
fibre to cork roller. Cut card into circle 4 inches diameter
and graduate circumference into degrees. Place (but do
not fix) card in proper position over coil, supporting it on
two corks cemented to board. Make needles as far as
possible astatic. Place them in position and cover all
with glass shade."
After some preliminary work with the galvanometer,
Darnell's cell and a simple form of Wheatstone's bridge
are made; then a rheochord and a set of resistance coils.
Then comes the following work with these instruments, in
each case the necessary instructions being printed under
the work to be done :—
"I. Measure relative resistances of different lengths of
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
the same copper wire by Wheatstone's Bridge. 2. Find
lengths of copper wires by measuring their relative resist-
ances, the length of one of the wires being known.
3. Ascertain relation between resistance and weight.
4. Ascertain effect of temperature on resistance. 5.
Experimentally establish the laws of divided circuits.
6. Measure the external resistance of your cell. 7. Com-
pare the electromotive force of your cell with that of a
Grove's cell."
In this direction there is, of course, an almost unlimited
field for practical work, but other parts of the subject
claim attention, and the time that can be given to the
whole is extremely limited. Our space will not allow us
to detail further what is done in this subject, nor can we
give more than a hasty glance to the other subjects that
are taken up in successive years-by the science teachers.
Sound is not a very promising branch of Physics for
practical work; nevertheless, nine or ten days are use-
fully spent on this subject. A monochord is the pihe de
resistance here, and when this is made the laws of the
transverse vibration of strings are verified, and the follow-
ing problems solved by its means :—" I. Weigh pieces of
metal of unknown weight. 2. The pitch of one tuning
fork being known,' ascertain that of another unknown.
3. The diameter of a German silver wire being known,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ascertain its specific gravity." By means of the ordinary
shilling tuning forks some useful experiments are made,
and finally the velocities of sound in various solid, liquid,
and gaseous bodies are determined in different ways and
•with a satisfactory approximation to the truth. This will
indicate merely the course of practical work in this
subject.
Heat and Light offer more facilities for practical work.
In Heat, a differential air thermometer is first made, then
an alcohol thermometer is made and graduated; the
maximum density of water is tried by simple hydro-
meters; a bulb tube is made, and here we quote two
experiments in which this bulb is used for determining
coefficients of expansion :—
"Determine mean Coefficients of absolute expansion
of Water and Alcohol between temperature of the day
and 50° C above.
"Weigh bulb tube filled with liquid at temperatures

it the spectra of various metallic vapours are examined
till some familiarity is acquired with different spectra.
Finally, a polariscope is made and different objects for
examination are devised. Our space is more than ex-
hausted, and we cannot follow the teachers further in their
work. Time will, no doubt, bring greater experience and
improve an already admirable course.
As we remarked in a former article, the good work done
by the Department must sooner or later indirectly affect
all classes. We trust the time is not far distant when the
pressure of public opinion will lead men and women alike
to feel but half educated if they have no acquaintance
with the living facts and solid ground of nature. The
happy results of such a change will soon become apparent.
Already, indeed, society is becoming more interested in
science. Some knowledge of the methods and results of
scientific inquiry is penetrating the population. New
habits of thought and modes of reasoning are spreading
widely. A juster estimate of the position of the scientific
explorer is being held. At the same time a truer know-
ledge of nature is diffusing more profound and doubtless

CARUS AND GERSTAECKERS "HANDBUCH
DER ZOOLOGIE"
Handbuch der Zoologie. Von Jul. Victor Carus und
C. E. A. Gerstaecker. (Leipzig: Engelmann.)
THE second volume of this work appeared in
1863, the first part of the first volume in 1868,
and at length the book is completed by the appear-
ance of the second part of the first volume in 1875.
It is somewhat late in the day to review the earlier
parts of the undertaking, but looking at it as a whole,
we do not hesitate to say that the "Handbuch" in
which Prof. Carus has had the chief share (the Arthro-
pods alone are treated by Prof. Gerstaecker) is emi-
nently useful and worthy of his high reputation for
perspicacity and practical good sense. There are few
men to whom zoologists both in this country as well as in
his fatherland, are so much indebted for solid help in
their labours of research or of instruction as to Prof.
Victor Carus. Who has not felt grateful to him for the
"Bibliotheca Zoologica," which bears his name? What
naturalist of this generation has not consulted, as a store-
house of inexhaustible treasure, the " Icones Zootomies,"
which, after twenty years, continues to hold its place as
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the most valuable pictorial treatise on the Invertebrata
which we possess? Prof. Carus has further served his
countrymen by acting as the competent translator of
Mr. Darwin's works—and to us he has lent timely aid by
discharging for two years the duties of the Edinburgh
chair of Natural History in the absence of Prof. Wyville
Thomson. In an enumeration of the labours of this
kind for which zoologists have to thank Prof. Carus, we
must not omit the volume on the history of Zoology—pub-
lished in the Munich series of histories of the sciences—
a work which is full of the most interesting details of the
early beginnings and strange developments of the study
of animal form.
It will not be out of place, whilst strongly recommending
this book to the reader as a most trustworthy, succinct, and
withal ample exposition of the facts of animal morpho-
logy in especial relation to the " system" or classification
of the Animal Kingdom—to say a few words as to its
method and order of treatment. The first volume (that
most recently published) contains the Vertebrata, the

in this book as in his " History" of Zoology, from the un-
philosophic conception of the scope and tendencies of
that division of Biology, which its early history has forced
upon modern science. In England our newest and most
conservative University continues to draw a broad dis-
tinction between what is called Comparative Anatomy
and what is called Zoology. By some accident Zoology
is the term which has become connected with the special
work of arranging specimens and naming species which
is carried on in great museums, and which has gone on in
museums since the days when "objects of natural his-
tory," and other curiosities, first attracted serious attention
in the sixteenth century. Accordingly Zoology, in this
limited sense, has taken the direction indicated by the
requirements of the curators of museums, and is supposed
to consist in the study of animals not as they are in toto,
but as they are for the purposes of the species-maker and
collector. In this limited Zoology, external characters or
the characters of easily preserved parts which on account
of their conspicuousness or durability are valuable for the

ready discrimination of the various specific forms—have
acquired a first place in consideration to which their real
significance as evidence of affinity or separation does not
entitle them. From time to time the limited zoologists
have adopted or accepted from the comparative anato-
mists hints or conclusions, and have worked them into
their schemes of classification. But it does seem to be
time in these days, when pretty nearly all persons are
agreed that the most natural classification of the Animal
Kingdom is that which is the nearest expression of the
Animal Pedigree, that systematic works on Zoology should
be emancipated from the hereditary tendencies of the old
treatises, and should present to us the classes and
orders of the Animal Kingdom defined not by the enu-
meration of easily recognised "marks," but by reference
to the deeper and more thorough-going characteristics
which indicate blood relationships. We have to note in
the " Handbuch " the not unfrequent citation of superficial
and insignificant characteristics in the brief diagnoses of
taxonomic groups, which seems in so excellent a work to
be due to a purposeless survival of the features of a mori-
bund zoology that>ould know nothing of "insides," and
still less of the doctrine of filiation. For instance, the
very first thing which we are told of the Vertebrata in the
short diagnosis of the group, is that they are " animals

with laterally symmetrical, elongated, externally unseg-
mented bodies;" of the Fishes, that they have the " skin
covered with scales or plates, seldom naked;" of the
Mollusca, that they have a "laterally symmetrical, com-
pressed body devoid of segmentation, often enclosed in a
single (generally spirally-twisted) or double calcareous
shell." It would be unjust to suggest that Prof. Carus,
who long ago did so much to establish zoological classi-
fication on an anatomical basis, is not fully alive to the
necessity, at the present day, of taking the wide bio-
logical view of animal morphology; but certainly the
form in which parts of the book are cast, savours oi the
past epoch. It may be said that the object of the book
is to present the "facts" of Zoology hi a logical order; and
that this sufficiently explains the arrangements to which
objection might be taken as above, viz. the commencing
with the higher instead of the'lower groups, the prominent
position assigned to external and little-significant cha-
racters, the absence of any recognition of the leading
doctrine of modern Zoology, the doctrine of filiation. To

these branches from one another has, first of all (and we
think with no exaggerated estimate of the gap to be
marked out), removed the Leptocardii altogether from
association with the other fish, and not only from associa-
tion with them but from association with the remaining
classes of Vertebrates. They stand alone 3s the group
Acrania, whilst the remaining Vertebrata are the Craniata.
The five remaining groups of Miiller's fishes find their
place with the Craniata, but one group is separated
within that large division as having no jaws, no limbs,
and an unpaired nostril; these are the Cyclostomi, which
are placed by Haeckel apart from all the remaining
Craniate Vertebrates. The steps of structural differentia-
tion which must be passed through to connect the
Lampreys with the lowest of the remaining groups of J.
Miiller's Pisces seems to warrant this. They, the Dipnoii
Ganoidei, Selachii, and Teleostei, all belong to the large
division of the double-nostrilled, jaw-bearing Craniata;

The class of Fishes is restricted to the three sub-classes of
Selachii, Ganoidei and Teleostei; of which the first are
the nearest representatives of the common ancestors of
the Ganoidei and Teleostei, whilst the Dipnoi form a
separate class of the Gnathostomous Craniate Vertebrata,
reaching well forwards in the direction of the Amphibia,
which were derived from Palasozoic Dipnoi, these in turn
having been derived from Ganoidei. No doubt, it would
not be possible to make any distinction between the
ancestral Ganoidei and Dipnoi of Palaeozoic times, had
we them all before us; but that is no reason why, in
framing our classifications, we should not use such breaks
and divisions of groups as will best indicate in the
tabular form the branching relationships of these and
neighbouring organisms. The consideration of a case
like the one just discussed renders it very obvious that
the whole method and point of view of the naturalist who
attempts to make classification the expression of the most
important laws of organic structure, and therefore a
genealogy, is different from that of the naturalist who
endeavours to make his groups as few as may be con-
venient, and such that a large number of propositions can
be affirmed with regard to them. The work of the latter
is marred by adhesion to a conventional form, that of the

The absence of illustrations to Prof. Carus's "Hand-
buch" is not to be considered as a deficiency. In the
first place, adequate illustration would immensely in-
crease the price of the work; in the second place, we
have already the "Icones," which may serve excellently
as an atlas for much of the second volume. What we
want now from Prof. Carus is another volume of "Icones,"
to contain illustrations of the Vertebrata.

being subject to so much regularity of habit, and
indeed such has been asserted as an observed fact. If,
then, this be so, there is every probability of her offspring
inheriting the same habit, and the daughter of a Cuckoo
which always placed her egg in a Reed Wren's or a Tit-
lark's nest doing the like." To this Mr. Harting very justly
replies—" This would be an excellent argument in sup-
port of the theory (of Dr. Baldamus) were it not for one
expression, upon which the whole value of the argument
seems to me to depend. What is meant by the ex-
pression 'Once successfully deposited?' Does the
Cuckoo ever revisit a nest in which she has placed
an egg and satisfy herself that her offspring is hatched
and cared for? If not (and I believe such an event
is not usual, if indeed it has ever been known to
occur), then nothing has been gained by the selection of
a Reed Wren's or.Titlark's nest (as the case may be), and
the Cuckoo.can have no'reason for continuing the practice
of using the same kind of nest from one season to
another." Mr. Harting therefore rejects the application

of this principle in the case of the Cuckoo. We will suggest
to him a modification of Prof, Newton's argument which
may perhaps lead him to return to it in its modified form.
The assumption that the bird which once successfully
deposited kher eggs in a Reed Wren's or Titlark's nest,
would again seek for one of the same species in other
seasons because of her sagacity, or her knowledge of its
successful hatching, is highly improbable in our estima-
mation, and not essential for the subsequent deductions,
in a Darwinian point of view. It is more logical to
suppose that ancestral Cuckoos deposited their eggs
broadcast. That those which got into Reed Wren's and
Titlark's nests (as in instances) all, or nearly all, hatched
out; whilst those deposited elsewhere perished. The
young inherited those peculiarities of the mother birds
whose tendency was towards the utilisation of the Reed
Wren's and Titlark's 'nests, and as a result the modern
Cuckoo tends to place its eggs in those nests.
The evidently genuine sketch made by Mrs. Blackburn
of the nestling Cuckoo ejecting the young of the Titlark
along with which it was hatched, first published in the
introduction to Gould's "Birds of Great Britain," is
introduced as confirmatory evidence in favour of this, to
the foster-brethren, murderous propensity of the young
birds, with reference to which so many naturalists are

still sceptical.
The peculiarity in the distribution of the Nightingale
in this country is difficult to explain, especially as the
Wryneck keeps within nearly the same boundaries.
"When we find this bird in summer as far to the west-
ward as Spain and Portugal, and as far to the northward
as Sweden, we may well be surprised at its absence from
Wales, Ireland, and Scotland ; and yet it is the fact that
the boundary line, over which it seldom if ever flies,
excludes it from Cornwall, West Devon ; part of Somer-
set, Gloucester, and Hereford; the whole of Wales
(a fortiori from Ireland), part of Shropshire, the whole of
Cheshire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, Durham, and
Northumberland." From these data it is not difficult to
recognise that with but few exceptions the Nightingale
only visits those parts of this country which arc, covered
with secondary or tertiary geological formations ; and it
has always seemed to us that it must be that the primary
soils do not produce food suitable for the insects on which
it feeds. It is true that the new red sandstone is the soil

Vibrations of a Liquid in a Cylindrical Vessel
In Nature for July 15, there is a short notice of a paper
read before the Physical Society by Prof. Guthrie on the period
of vibration of water in cylindrical vessels. It may be of in-
terest to point out that the results arrived at by Prof. Guthrie
experimentally, and many others of a like nature, may also be
obtained from theory.
In the first place the fact, that the period of a given mode of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
vibration of liquid in a cylindrical vessel of infinite depth and of
section always similar to itself (e.g. always circular) is propor-
tional to the square root of the linear dimension of the section,
follows from the theory of dimensions without any calculation.
For the only quantities on which the period r could depend ar«
(1) p the density of the liquid, (2) f the acceleration of gravity,
and (3) the linear dimension d. Now as in the case of a common
pendulum it is evident that t cannot depend upon p. If the
density of the liquid be doubled, the force which act upon it is
also doubled, and therefore the motion is the same as before the
change. Thus t, a time, is a function of d, a length, and g.
Since g is — 2 dimensions in time, t oc g - J, and therefore in
order to be independent of the unit of length, it must vary as di
inasmuch as g is of one dimension in length. Hence t cc di g- 4.
This reasoning, it will be observed, only applies when the
depth may be treated as infinite.
The actual calculation of t for any given form of vessel involves,
of course, high mathematics, the case of a circular section
depending on liessel's functions. But there is an interesting con-
nection between the problem of the vibration of heavy liquid in a
cylindrical vessel of any section and of finite or infinite depth,

NA TURE
I fed pot A with pure distilled water, B with strong decoction
of beef, and C with '0026 per cent, solution of phosphate of
ammonia.
The results are briefly these, after seventeen days' experimen-
tation: In A all the plants are growing and looking perfectly
healthy, though those with four leaves buried and the roots
exposed, looked sickly for a few days. Now, however, they are
putting forth new leaves; so are those with all the leaves pinched
off and the roots buried.
Those with the roots pinched off and all the leaves buried are
bursting into flower.
In B all the plants are greatly damaged, those with the leaves
only, and those with the roots only are quite dead. Those with
the roots off and the leaves buried have their leaf stalks much
blackened, as described by Mr. Darwin as the result of over-
feeding. The pot smells strongly of ammonia.
In C the condition is very much as in A, but the growth has
been much more active, for some of the plants with the roots off
and leaves buried have pushed new leaves up through the sand,
and those with only four leaves buried have put out numerous
new leaves, and their roots are quite dry. In one of these latter

I amputated the roots five days after it had been in the pot, and
it is as vigorous as the rest. About '03 of a grain of phosphate
of ammonia has been supplied to this pot during twelve days for
twelve plants.
It is, therefore, perfectly certain that the sun-dew can not only
absorb nutriment by its leaves, but that it can actually live by
their aid alone, and that it thrives better if supplied with nitro-
genous material in small quantities.
The nitrogenous matter is more readily absorbed by ihe leaves
than by the roots, for over-feeding kills the plant sooner by the
leaves alone than by the roots alone. But it is also certain that
the roots absorb nitrogenous matter.
On June 17 I read a paper to the Birmingham Natural History
Society, in which I announced that I had been able to separate
a substance closely resembling pepsine from the secretion of
the Drosera dicholoma. Since then I have also separated it from
the fluid taken from the pitchers of various nepenthes.
The secretion from the Dichotoma was gathered on a feather
which was washed in pure distilled water. It made the water
very viscid, although probably the whole amount gathered from
the only available plant was not more than six or eight minims,
and an ounce of water was used. One cubic centimetre of this
solution to five cubic centimetres of fresh milk separated a thick
viscid mass, with a very small quantity of whey, in about twelve
hours, at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. This

mixture was kept in an open test glass three weeks, but it never
became putrid.
The remainder of the solution was accidulated with dilute
phosphoric acid, and then a thin mixture of chalk and water was
added drop by drop till effervescence ceased. The mixture was
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours and the clear fluid
removed.
The precipitate was treated with very dilute hydrochloric
acid, and the result treated with a saturated solution of pure
cholestearine made by Beneke's method, in a mixture of abso-
lute alcohol and absolute ether. The mass which separated
was then dissolved in absolute ether, and in the resulting water
was suspended a greyish flocculent matter which, on examina-
tion was found to be perfectly amorphous. It was dried at a
temperature of 42°, and weighed, roughly, a third of a grain.
It was partially soluble in distilled water, not at all in boiling
water, greatly soluble in glycerine, and it produced the charac-
teristic viscid change on a small quantity of fresh milk.
Fluid was taken from three nepenthe pitchers which had not
opened their valves, to the amount of 2-3 cubic centimetres. It
was treated in the same way as described above, and yielded a

midst of heavy rain, N.E. wind, high barometric pressure, and
an abnormal sky-spectrum, you may be interested in hearing how
matters quieted down until this Monday, when we have a delight-
ful drying west wind, high floating clouds, and a normal sky-
spectrum showing fine lines only.
On Tuesday the 20th then, there was a sensible alleviation of
Monday's abnormal spectrum bands, though they were still
there; and the weather, though dark, began to clear.
On the 21 st and 22nd, the abnormal bands had almost disap-
peared, leaving the lines proper of the spectrum easily visible, and
the weather was fine.
Friday, the 23rd, however, was wet by day and very wet at
night; yet the sky-spectrum was good and nearly normal.
Note, however, from the Meteorological Journal below,* that
this rain came with a west wind, a low barometer, and a con-
siderable fall of temperature. And the wind has been westerly
ever since, and with a normal sky-spectrum.
Hence the intensification of the band on the less refrangible
side of 1) would seem to be thus far identifiable both in London
and Edinburgh with warm rain in an easterly wind and under a
high barometer.

While, that the said band really was intensified to a very note-
worthy degree, and quite abnormally both with respect to the
broader band which appears on the more refrangible side of D
(or over W.L. L. 5830—5680), and to other telluric manifesta-
tions, at sunset—is demonstrated now most satisfactorily by my
having just heard from my friend, Prof. P. G. Tail, M.A., whom
I had not seen for six weeks before, that he has been independ-
ently observing in Edinburgh the very same phenomenon, and
almost at the same times, and on the same days. He was much
struck too at obtaining the chief abnormal band on the most
marked days from all parts of the sky and at all hours, and had
considered what it might mean.
He has further pointed out to me since then, that Angstrom's
map shows fine telluric lines in the place of the grand smoky
band we observed with small spectroscopic power in W.L.L.
6000-5880; but makes them much less, instead of very much
more, dark than the well-known 5830-5680 evening band; so
that the question 'now is, what is it that intensifies the former
and not the latter under the meteorological conditions noted?

the trivialities of everyday life, electricity has a part to
play. The generation of the voltaic current for tele-
graphic purposes is based upon one or other of these
principles; and it is essential in telegraphy that the
power of the current derived from the battery should
be adjusted to the circuit.
The strength of the current depends on the ehctro-
trwlh'e foree of the battery and upon the resistance of ihe
circuit. The precise meaning to be attached to these
terms was first pointed out by Ohm in 1827, who showed
that the strength of the current is directly proportional to
the former and inversely proportional to the latter. The
statement of this relation is commonly spoken of as
"Ohm's Law." The total resistance of a telegraphic
circuit is made up partly of the resistance of the battery,
and its necessary connections, and partly of the resistance

quently the law established by Ohm may be expressed as

The available effective force of any current = the electromotive
force of the liattery—(the resistance of the Battery + the
resistance of the line wire).
It has been found that in any given case the electro-
motive force and resistance depend upon conditions that
may be thus stated :—

NATURE
First, " The electromotive force of a voltaic circuit varies
with the number of the elements, and the nature of the
metals and liquids which constitute each element, but is
in no degree dependent on the dimensions of any of their
parts." Second, "The resistance of each element is directly
proportional to the distances of the plates from each other
in the liquid, and to the specific resistance of the liquid;
and is also inversely proportional to the surface of the
plates in contact with the liquids." Third," The resistance
of the connecting wire of the circuit is directly proportional
to its length and to its specific resistance, and inversely
proportional to its section." Some of the more important
forms of battery in use will now be described.
Daniell's Battery, Fig. 42, consists of an earthenware
or glass vessel, within which a smaller jar of some porous
material is placed ; the space between the inner and outer
jars is filled with a dilute solution of sulphuric acid and
water, and within the porous jar a saturated solution of
sulphate of copper; a cylinder of zinc is immersed in the
acid solution, and a cylinder of copper in the sulphate
solution, crystals of sulphate of copper being introduced

to maintain the strength of the copper medium. The
current from this battery is remarkably constant, a matter
of the greatest importance in the working of a telegraphic
circuit, as with a variation in the working strength of the
current, continued adjustment of the transmitting and
recording apparatus is rendered necessary. Bunsen's
battery (Fig. 43) in many respects resembles the Daniell
arrangement; carbon is used within the porous cell in
place of the copper cylinder, and nitric acid replaces the
saturated solution of sulphate of copper. The current
produced is stronger, but less constant than that from the
Daniell's cell.
Many other arrangements for the generation of a voltaic
current for telegraphic purposes are in use, such as the
"Marie" Davy" (Fig. 44), the "Leclanchd," and "Cal-
laud " batteries; more or less, each has its special merits
and demerits: practically, the "Daniell" remains unsur-
passed. The essential condition of every practical form
of battery is that it shall produce a constant current be free
from local action, and possess mechanical facility of reno-
vation, with simplicity and economy of construction.

vast importance. By this means the electrical insulation
of a submarine cable or a land wire is definitely ascer-
tained, and the existence of a fault, together with its
locality, defined. Without some established unit of re-
sistance by which to compare the working circuit with its
electrical equivalent, no test of insulation can be main-
tained or restoration of a circuit carried out. By general
acceptance a standard of measurement has been adopted,
a unit of resistance known as the B.A. (British Associa-
tion) unit. It is unnecessary to enter into detail as to the
mechanical problems which determine this unit of resist-
ance ; it is sufficient to state that the electrical resistance
or value of every circuit, land wire and submarine cable,
is now by universal acceptance recorded in B.A. units.
For instance, a guttapercha submarine cable core may
be stated to be so many hundred millions B.A units of
insulation test ; while, again, an indiarubber core may be
stated to be so many thousand millions of B.A. units of
resistance ; a correct comparison is thus at once deter-
mined.

single observer only having seen a comet, is hardly a
sufficient argument against its existence. The late Prof.
d'Arrest even thought it worth while to submit the re-
puted observations of the D'Angos-Comet of 1784 to
further calculation, notwithstanding Encke's well-known
investigation in the "Correspondance Aslronomique" of
the Baron de Zach. and we may have something to say
on this subject in a future column. Not having seen any
reference to "Stark's comet" in English astronomical
works, we have given the particulars recorded of it here.
THE GREAT COMET OF 1843.—There was some doubt
at the time, from the difficulty attending the determina-
tion of the orbit of this extraordinary body upon the
European observations, whether it had transited the sun's
disc on the day of perihelion or not. The definitive orbit
calculated by a most complete investigation by the late
Prof. Hubbard, of Washington, shows that a transit did
actually take place on the evening of February 27, Green-
wich time, and might have been observed in Australia.

D'ARREST'S COMET IN 1877.—The mean motion of this
comet at the last appearance in 1870, determined by M.
Lcveau from an elaborate calculation of the perturba-
tions in the two preceding revolutions, would bring this
comet into perihelion again on April 17, 1877. The effect
of planetary attraction in the present revolution being
comparatively small, if we take this date for perihelion
passage, the computed path is not likely to differ ma-
terially from the true one. It is as follows :—

How varied the programme of this exhibition is will be
seen from the above, as well as the fact that the geo-
graphy of the present day is a very complicated and all-
embracing province of knowledge indeed.
It is impossible here to analyse in detail the exhibits
of each country; we can only at present refer to some of
the objects which, as we learn from a correspondent, have
attracted considerable attention.
The fine set of instruments for travellers exhibited by
our Royal Geographical Society, and invented by Capt.
Georges, R.N., seems to have excited considerable atten-
tion; it includes a double pockef sextant, an artificial
horizon, and a barometer; the latter especially, on
account of its ingenious construction, making it useful in
mountaineering, is said to have attracted the attention of
the New French Alpine Club.

ing a crank working on a small notched wheel which
multiplies by ten the number of degrees on the limb on
which the readings are taken; a close approximation can
thus be obtained by a very simple contrivance.
A Russian marine officer has sent a compass magnifi-
cently fitted up, and a lead for taking soundings, and
samples of the bottom in lakes and shallow seas. It
was used with success on Ladoga, the Caspian, and the
Baltic. The apparatus is very simple, cheap, and not
ponderous.
Mohn's map of churches struck by lightning in Norway
is exhibited in order to illustrate the special danger of
lightning to churches. It shows that two churches in
every three years are struck and one of the two is utterly
destroyed, and that in a climate where thunderstorms are
relatively infrequent.
Sweden exhibits two wonderful pieces of apparatus.
The first is a meteorograph for printing in numbers the
degrees of dry and wet bulb thermometer, barometer, and
the force of the wind. The types are placed on wheels
which are moved every quarter of an hour by electricity.
The barometer is a syphon one, and the thermometers
open by the top a needle which descends every quarter of
an hour into the mercury and gives the degree. The
apparatus works regularly at the University of Upsal
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and at the Vienna Observatory, where the readings have
been found quite correct. The printed sheets obtained at
Upsal are posted on the wall of the Geographical Ex-
hibition.
A Swedish engineer has invented a machine to show
where to find beds of iron ore, and to determine also the
depth to which it is necessary to descend. The miracle is
performed by tracing on a map isodynamic magnetic
curves, with a compass exposed to the perturbating influ-
ence of a magnetic needle placed at a distance. Two
systems of isodynamic curves are to be traced, and the
distance between both centres is proved to indicate the
depth. Experiments and explorations with this extraordi-
nary instrument have proved successful.
The Belgian universal meteorograph, as used in Ghent,
is said to be the great success of the Exhibition. It is
expected to create a revolution in weather-warnings and
in meteorology generally, and will leave the famous
Greenwich registering apparatus far behind. A reading
is taken every quarter of an hour and engraved on copper
ready for going through the press. The inventor is M. Van

Geological Society, June 23.*—Mr. John Evans, V.P.R.S.,
president, in the chair.—On the Granitoid and associated Meta-
morphic Rocks of the Lake-district, by J. Clifton Ward.
Part I. On the Liquid Cavities in the Quartz bearing Rocks of the
Lake-district.—The object of this paper was to examine into the
evidence afforded by the liquid cavities of the granitoid rocks of
the Lake-district, with reference to the pressure under which these
rocks may have consolidated. In the first division of the subject the
geological relations of the three granitic centres of the district
were considered, and it was shown that these several granitic
masses probably solidified at depths varying from 14,000 feet to
30,000 feet. The most probable maximum depth for the Skiddaw
granite was stated as 30,000 feet ; the maximum for the Eskdale
granite 22,000 leet; and for the Shap granite 14,000 feet. These
maximum depths were arrived at by estimating the greatest
thickness of strata that were ever, at one time, accumulated
above the horizon of the top of the Skiddaw slates. The mode
of microscopic examination, together with a description of the
precautions taken in measuring the relative sizes of the cavities
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
and their contained vacuities, formed the second division of the
paper. It was stated that all the measurements used in the
calculations were made from cases in which the vacuity mixed
freely in the liquid of the cavity, and an approximately perfct
case for measurement was defined to be one in which the outline
of the liquid cavity was sharply defined all round in one focus,
and in which the vacuity moved freely to every part of the cavity
without going out of focus. Then followed the general results of
the examination. Restricting the measurements to such cases as
those above mentioned, the results were found to be generally
consistent with one another, and with those previously obtained
by Mr. Sorby in his examination of other granitic districts.
From the fact that the calculated pressure in feet of rock was in
all cases greatly in excess of the pressure which could have
resulted from the thickness of overlying rocks, it was inferred as
probable that these granitic masses were not directly connected
with volcanic action, by which the pressure might have been
relieved, but that the surplus pressure was spent in the work of
elevation and contortion of the overlying rocks. Microscopic,
combined with field evidence, was thought to indicate that the
Shap granite, though mainly formed at a depth similar to that
at which the Eskdale granite consolidated, was yet itself finally
consolidated at a much less depth, the mass having eaten its way
upwards at a certain point, and perhaps representing an unsuc
cessful effort towards the formation of a volcanic centre. The
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
examination showed that the mean of the pressures under which
the Lake-district granites probably consolidated was nearly the
same as the mean which Mr. Sorby arrived at for those of Corn-
wall. In conclusion the author stated that he wished these
results to be considered as preliminary only, since the complete
investigation would necessarily occupy far more time than was
at his disposal ; at the same time he ventured to hope that general
accuracy was insured, while pointing to the many little-known
causes which might affect the conclusions.
Part II. On the Eskdale and Shap Granites, wUh their associated
Metamorphic Rocks.—The author brought forward evidence in
this paper to prove the possibility of the formation of granite by
the extreme metamorphism of volcanic rocks. The passage is
shown in the field, and may be observed in a complete series of
hand specimens. Frequently, indeed, the actual junction is well
marked, but in other cases the transition is gradual ; and there
occur at some little distance from the main mass, inlying patches
of what may be called bastard granite. The microscopic exami-
nation proves the passage from a distinctly fragmentary (ash) to
a distinctly crystalline rock, and to granite itself. Also the
chemical composition of the altered rocks agrees very closely

Snr.ith, F.L.S. These were identified with the bodies which
Mr. Berkeley had lately regarded as a species of Protoniycts, and
tile cause of a new malady in the potato. The following are the
principal points in this very important communication :—On re-
ceiving authentic specimens of diseased plants from Mr. Barron,
Gardener-in-Chief to the Society, the brown spots on the potato-
leaves at once called to mind the figures of some species of Pro-
tomycts, and the dimensions agreed tolerably well with some
described plants of that genus, but the spots, when seen under a
high power, appeared very unlike any fungus, and they were very
sparingly mixed with other bodies much smaller in diameter, and
with a greater external resemblance to true fungus spores. These
latter spore-like bodies were of two sizes—one transparent and of
exactly the same si/e as the cells of the leaf (and therefore very
easily overlooked), and the other dark, reticulated, and much
smaller. A few mycelial threads might be seen winding amongst
the cellular tissue. The author's opinion, therefore, was soon
formed that the "new" potato disease was no other than the old
Ptronospora infestans in an unusual and exciled condition. That
climatic conditions had thrown the growth of this fungus forward
and out of season was probable ; but the idea that the pest would

nut at length attack all and every sort of potato seemed un-
reasonable, though the more tender sorts might be the first to
suffer. From day to day the diseased leaves and stems and tubers
were kept between pieces of very wet calico, in plates under
glass, and it was immediately noticed that the continued moisture
greatly excited the growth of the mycelial threads. So rapid
was now the growth of this mycelium, that after a week had
elapsed some decayed parts of the lamina of the leaf were tra-
versed in every direction by the spawn. In about ten days the
mycelium produced a tolerably abundant crop, especially in the
abortive tubers, of the two-sized bodies previously seen in
the fresh leaves. The larger of these bodies Mr. Smith was
disposed to consider the "oospore" of the potato fungus, and
the smaller bodies as the "antheridia" of the same fungus,
which are often terminal in position. The filaments of the latter
are commonly much articulated, and sometimes more or less
moniliform or necklace-like. Both oospore and antheridium are
very similar in nature and size to those described as belonging to
Pcronospora alsinearum and P. umbillijerarum, and this is another
reason (beyond the occurrence of undoubted P. injestans on potato-
leaves at the beginning of June) why he was disposed to look upon
these bodies as the oospore and antheridium of the potato iungus.
The larger bodies are at first transparent, thin, pale brown, fur-
nished with a thick dark outer wall, and filled with granules; at
length a number (usually three) of vacuities or nuclei appear.

The smaller bodies are darker in colour, and the external coat is
marked with a few reticulations, possibly owing to the collapsing
ol the outer wall. At present he had been unable to detect any
fecundating tube (described as belonging to the antheridium of
other species of Ptronosfora), but he had observed the two
bodies in contact in several instances. After fertilisation has
taken place, the outer coat of the oospore enlarges, aud appears
to be cast off. Both amheridium and resting-spore are so slightly
articulated to the threads on which they are borne that they are
detached by the slightest touch, but with a little care it is not
really difficult to see both bodies in situ; and my observations
lead me to think that conjugation frequently takes place after
both organs are quite free. The antheiidia and oospores are
best seen in the wettest and most thoroughly decomposing tuber,
but they occur also in both the stem and leaf. The author was
also disposed to regard Montague's Arlotrogus as identical with
the lesting-spore of Peronosfora infestans, an opinion which had
long been held by Mr. Berkeley.

THE United States of America have certainly done
noble work in the exploration and mapping of their
vast empire. Most of the long-settled States have for
many years possessed elaborate maps and reports upon
the topography, geology, and agricultural features of their
territory. The central Government has likewise carried
on extensive and admirable coast surveys, besides innu-
merable expeditions and surveys for opening up the less
known or wholly unvisited regions of the interior of the
continent. Were all the literature connected with this
subject gathered together it would be found to form of
itself a goodly library. Some of it has been published in
most costly and indeed luxurious style; other portions,
and these sometimes not the least interesting or valuable,
have to be unearthed from the pages of flimsily printed
"blue-books." But whatever be their external guise,
these narratives are pervaded by an earnestness and
enthusiasm, a consciousness of the magnitude of the scale
on which the phenomena have been produced, and yet a
restrained style of quiet description, which cannot but

strike the reader. Their writers have evidently had their
feelings of awe and admiration worked sometimes up to
the highest pitch, yet they contrive on the whole to pre-
sent just such plain frank statements of facts as to convey
clear and definite notions of the regions they describe.
Though little is said about hardships and hair-breadth
escapes, one can see that these bold explorers could not
have accomplished what they so modestly and quietly
narrate without a vast amount of privation and danger.
Some of them, indeed, like poor young Loring in 1871,
have lost their lives by Indian assassins, others have
fallen victims to the disease and debility necessarily
attendant on so much exposure. But on the whole the
work seems to be healthy, and the men engaged upon it
like it and keep to it.
Leaving for the present the consideration of what has
been done and is now doing in the more settled States,
let us turn to those vast territories lying to the west and
stretching across the Rocky Mountains to the shores of
the Pacific. At the beginning of this century compara-
tively little was known of these regions. But the Govern-
ment then resolved to gather some information on the
subject, and with that end despatched an expedition in
1804 which penetrated the wilderness, reached the western
sea-board, and after much hardship brought back a first

instalment of knowledge regarding this part of the con-
tinent. During the period preceding the year 1851,
somewhere about forty exploring and survey parties were
sent by the War Department into the tracts lying to the
west ot the Mississippi. But in the next twenty years,
viz., from 1850 to 1870, the same Department conducted
forty-six of these surveys, not merely for military purposes,
but to aid in the general opening up of the vast unex-
plored territories. As a rule, however, and until com-
paratively recently, these expeditions could make no
pretensions to geographical accuracy. Their object was
merely to fix as well and as rapidly as might be the
positions of main landmarks, and to collect such informa-

But the discovery of gold in California at once drew

desire to open up a better and more expeditious commu-

there was no reason to doubt.. As the Depaitment had
been for more than half a century in undisputed com-
mand of the exploratory expeditions of those western
regions, perhaps some of its more zealous functionaries
may have grown somewhat jealous of the increasing
popularity of the work done by the Department of the
Interior, and may have looked upon that work as an
unwarrantable encroachment upon the recognised pro-
vince of the military corps. Be this as it may, a chance
meeting of two independent survey parties in 1873, and
the fact that to a certain extent they both surveyed the
same ground, led to a battle royal in the spring of last
year, wherein appeared the chiefs of the Departments
with President Grant at their head, military men, geolo-
gists, naturalists, topographers, and several cohorts of
professors. Evidently some of the parties knew that the
contest would come sooner or later, and were prepared
accordingly. The first bomb-shell was thrown as it were
by an outsider, on the ijth of April, 1874, when Mr.
Lazarus D. Shoemaker carried a resolution in Congress
requesting the President to inform the House what geo-

graphical and geological surveys were carried on by the
Government in the same or contiguous areas of territory
lying to the west of the Mississippi, and whether these
could not be combined under one Department, or at
least have their respective geographical limits defined.
The question thus raised turn out to be really whether
the War Department should have entire control of the
surveys, both those intended for military and those for
purely civil purposes. The President replied that they
would be more economically and quite as efficiently
carried on by the military authorities. Not content with
this recommendation of its military chief, Congress
referred the matter to its Committee on Public Lands.
A careful investigation followed, and though the military
side fought hard for its supremacy, the Committee
decided against the purposed consolidation. Their con-
clusions ran thus: "That the Surveys under the War
Department, so far as the same are necessary for military
purposes, should be continued ; that all other Surveys for
geographical, geological, topographical, and scientific
purposes should be continued under the Department of
the Interior, and that suitable appropriations should be
made by Congress to accomplish these results."
There can be little doubt that though it must have
chagrined some sanguine partisans whose ebullitions of

temper lorm an amusing feature in the congressional
blue-book, this decision of the Committee was in the cir-
cumstances a wise one, and one which, followed out by
the Government, will have an important influence in the
development' ol the vast and still unexplored regions over
which the surveys have yet to extend. It is impossible
that the corps of Engineers, weighted with all the
numerous and arduous duties which form its ordinary
work, should be able to furnish the necessary complement
of trained geologists, botanists, naturalists, and other
scientific men for the adequate exploration of the territories.
In fact, the scientific work of that corps has all along been
done in great measure by civilians. But it is neither
needful nor desirable that civilians of high training in
practical scientific work should be placed under military
direction. They move mor« freely without it. And a«
in ths Western Territorlci they declare that they no
longer need the protection of an escort, the sole remaining
reason for a military supervision would seem to be
removed.

data in meteorology, topography, natural history, or other
information gathered in the course of the Survey. Next
we have large quarto monographs, admirably printed and
illustrated, devoted to the discussion of the more technical
and matured results, such, for instance, as the palaeon-
tology of a wide region or of a formation. Lastly, a series

Survey of the Territories. But the delay in the issuing of
a general map is as necessary as it is prudent. A report
may be written of what one sees. It is complete in itself;
and if it is found to contain errors, these can be corrected
in a subsequent report. But a sheet of a geological map
must fit accurately to its neighbours. II it is surveyed
and published without waiting for the investigation of the
surrounding area, it will most probably be found some-
where, at least, erroneous ; and to make it harmonise with
adjoining sheets may require so much alteration as to
demand, perhaps, even the cancelling of the old and the
engraving of a new plate. Therefore we are content to
wait for Dr. Hayden's geological map of the Territories
in confident anticipation that it will be worthy of the high
reputation which he and his staff have already gained.
It should be added, that with the most praiseworthy
liberality the publications of the Survey are distributed as
gifts to learned bodies and scientific men all over the
world. All that is asked is that, where possible, the scien-
tific publications of the recipients of the volumes may be
sent in exchange. It is to be hoped that this generous
spirit has called forth a similar feeling elsewhere, and that
the library of the Geological Survey of the Territories is
continually augmented by presents from all parts of the
world. Arch. Geikie

FISKE'S "COSMIC PHILOSOPHY"
Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, based on the Doctrine of
Evolution, with Criticisms on the Positive Philosophy.
By John Fiske, M.A., LL.B., Assistant Librarian, and
formerly Lecturer on Philosophy, at Harvard Uni-
versity. 2 vols. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1874.)
WE have repeatedly expressed our admiration of the
system of philosophy which Mr. Spencer is en-
gaged in working out. Mr. Fiske, in giving an outline of
this philosophy, has called it Cosmic; a name which he
thinks peculiarly fitting, because "the term 'Cosmos'
connotes the orderly succession of phenomena quite as
forcibly as it denotes the totality of phenomena; and with
anything absolute or ontological, with anything save the
'Mundus' or orderly world of phenomena, It hat nothing
whatever to do." But Mr. Spencer is far from ignoring
the absolute, and the ontological element in his specula-
tions has frequently been the subject of criticism ; and
surely Mr. Fiske goes beyond an account of the orderly
succession of phenomena in all that he has to say about
the " Infinite Power manifested in the world of pheno-

birth ; then arises the phenomenon of infancy. The orang-
outang, until about a month old, "lies on its back, tossing
about and examining its hands and feet;" with the lowest
savages the period of helplessness is much longer, and
as civilisation advances, the period during which the child
must depend on the parent for support, becomes still
longer. Mr. Fiske believes that these considerations
supply "a very thorough and satisfactory explanation of
the change from gregariousness to sociality." "The pro-
longed helplessness of the offspring must keep the
parents together for longer and longer periods in succes-
sive epochs ; and when at last the association is so long
kept up that the older children are growing mature, while
the younger ones still need protection, the family relations
begin to become permanent. The parents have lived so
long in company that to seek new companionships
involves some disturbance of ingrained habits; and
meanwhile the older sons are more likely to continue their
original association with each other than to establish
associations with strangers, since they have common
objects to achieve, and common enmities, bequeathed and

acquired, with neighbouring families. As the parent
dies, the headship of the family thus established devolves
upon the oldest, or bravest, or most sagacious male
remaining. Thus the little group gradually becomes a
clan, the members of which are united by ties considerably
stronger than those which ally them to members of
adjacent clans, with whom they may indeed combine to
resist the aggressions of yet further outlying clans, or of
formidable beasts, but towards whom their feelings are
usually those of hostile rivalry." "In this new sugges-
tion," says Mr. Fiske, "as to the causes and the effects
of the prolonged infancy of man, I believe we have a
suggestion as fruitful as the one which we owe to Mr.
Wallace," and "the clue to the solution of the entire
problem " of the origin of the human race.
Towards the end of the second volume there is a good
deal of more or less original matter relating to religion,
much of which we think open to serious criticism, but on
which we cannot enter here. There is, however, in the
writings of Mr. Spencer, a view (adopted by Mr. Fiske)
with respect to the relation of feeling to movement which
appears to us to be nothing more than a popular fallacy,
and which, as it seems to us, spreads much confusion
through the psychological part of his system. The
assumption against which we would direct some criticism
           Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
is, that feelings stand in a causal relation to bodily
movements. The point has recently occupied some
attention, but we must reserve our remarks for another
article.
Though we admire the far-reaching speculations of
Mr. Spencer as more wonderfully consistent than the
thoughts of any other thinker of equal range, we cannot
regard his writings as criticism-proof at all points. Mr.
Fiske, in arguing against the volitional theory of causation,
says : " Phenomenally we know of will only as the cause
of certain limited and very peculiar kinds of activity dis-
played by the nerves and muscles of the higher animals.
And to argue from this that all other kinds of activity are
equally caused by will . . . is as monstrous a stretch of
assumption as can well be imagined." "Because this is
the only cause of which we are conscious, ... we are
asked to assume, without further evidence, that through-
out the infinitely multitudinous and heterogeneous pheno-
mena of nature no other kind of cause exists. A more
amazing example of the audacity of the subjective method
could hardly be found." We hope soon to see the evolu-

NATURE
prepared to show how a given quantity of molecular
motion in nerve-tissue can become transformed into a
definable amount of ideation or feeling." Strange that it
does not occur to our philosophers that they just leap
this impassable gulf from the other side when they talk
about a multitude of solid and fluid parts being set in
motion by the will, in the same sense in which a spark
causes an explosion of gunpowder. Either the volition
is itself a mode of motion, which Mr. Fiske solemnly
denies, or the circuit is not closed, which he as solemnly
asserts it to be.
The inconsistency and consequent error, to which we
have called attention, cause much more widespread con-
fusion than might at first be supposed. In one direction
we have seen the closed circuit of motion broken in on.
In the opposite direction we have elaborate attempts to
evolve mind out of matter, all specific and impressive
declarations to the contrary notwithstanding. In this
direction Mr. Lewes has gone forward with a more un-
compromising logic than is to be found in the volumes
before us. Mr. Fiske agrees with Mr. Lewes that both

"life and mind are processes," but we do not find that he
goes on to picture consciousness " as, a mass of stationary
waves formed out of the individual waves of neural
tremors." The evolution philosophy, starting from the
primeval nebula, finds every science a specialised part of
some more general science. Biology is a specialised part
of geology, and psychology is a specialised part of bio-
logy. "Mind here appears," says Mr. Fiske, " to be but
the highest form of Life," and life, as admirably defined by
Mr. Spencer," is the definite combination of heterogeneous
changes, both simultaneous and successive, in corre-
spondence with external co-existences and sequences."
Truly the study of the higher forms of these phenomena
may be called a specialised part of biology. But may we
call any adjustment of internal relations to external rela-
tions Mind? We think not, and in this Mr. Fiske
heartily agrees with us, for he hastens to tell us that
"push our researches in biology as far as we may, the
most we can ever ascertain is that certain nerve-changes
succeed certain .other nerve-changes or certain external
stimuli in a certain definite order. But all this of itself
can render no account of the simplest phenomenon of
consciousness." And Mr. Spencer is equally emphatic :—
"The thoughts and feeling whid&onstitute a conscious-
ness form an existence that has no place among the exist-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ences with which the rest of the sciences deal." But
where are we now? If in psychology any part of the
phenomena studied are those given directly in conscious-
ness, then they are not the phenomena which form a
specialised part of biology. Consciousness, then, is not
evolved out of the primeval nebula. It creeps in surrep-
tiously somewhere in the course of the evolution of
organised beings, and appears in man, the highest pro-
duct of evolution, as a power guiding his movements.
This, to our mind, is the weak point in Mr. Spencer's
philosophy.
Let us glance at Mr. Fiske's chapter on the Evolution
of Mind, which he tells us "was mostly written, and the
theory contained therein entirely worked out, before thepub-
lication of Part V. of the second edition of Mr. Spencer's
'Principles of Psychology.'" In so far as this so-called the-
ory of the evolution of, mind is an account of the evolution
of the nervous system, it may be open to no serious criti-
cism. But what happens is this: From talking of waves

consideration to be hopelessly inconsistent, we have been
inspired by no other feeling than a desire to see the
philosophy we admire purified from an error that greatly
mars its beauty. Let it be accepted that states of con-
sciousness really stand outside the circuit of motions and
therefore can never be a cause of any movement, and the
occasion of all the confusion of which we have spoken
disappears.
Mr. Spencer, who has been so kind as to read the
proof of this article, tells me by letter that he thinks I
have not quite remembered his point of view and its
implications. He says :—" The implication of your argu-
ment seems to be that I identify motion as it actually
exists with motion as manifested to our consciousness. Did
I do this there would be the incpnsistency you allege in
the supposition that feeling is transformable into motion
and motion into feeling. . . . But that transformation
which I assume to take place (though without in the
least understanding how) is the transformation of the
subjective activity we call feeling (unknowable in its
ultimate nature) into the objective activity we call motion

(also unknowable in its ultimate nature)," On the meta-
physical question my own view probably does not differ
much from Mr. Spencer's; but I would have it kept dis-
tinct from the question of ordinal y science, which deals
only with the relations of things as manifested to our
consciousness. And I leave it to Mr. Fiske and his
readers to deteimine whether in the passages I have
quoted from his work he means motion and feeling as
known to us—the motion and feeling of science, or the
ontological entities of the metaphysician, with which in
his preface he has told us his system " has nothing what-
ever to do." DOUGLAS A. SPALDING

Notes on the Fertilisation of the Cereals. By A. S. Wilson.
(Reprinted from the " Transactions of the Botanical
Society of Edinburgh.")
NOTWITHSTANDING the practical importance to the
farmer of a knowledge of the mode in which our cereal
crops are (ertilised, it is singular that different views still
prevail on several essential particulars. One point ap-
pears to be generally conceded, that insects have nothing
to do with it ; the .ovules are either self-fertilised, or cross-
fertilised by the agency of the wind. Dr. Boswell-Syme
and the present author incline towards the former; Del-
pino and Hildebrand to the latter view, at all events in

the case of wheat ; and Belgian farmers still trail ropes
over their flowering wheat to insure complete fertilisation.
Although we cannot altogether agree with Mr. Wilson's
conclusions, he has added some most valuable obser-
vations to our knowledge of the subject, especially
with regard to the remarkable extension of the fila-
ments immediately previous to, or concurrently with,
the discharge of the pollen. If a rye-flower, he states, is
opened a moment before the natural time of flowering,
the filaments will be found to measure about one-sixteenth
of an inch in length. In the course of five minutes, or
less, from the instant the pales begin to open, the fila-
ments will, in many cases, have grown to twelve-sixteenths,
and the whole of the pollen will have fallen out; and this
rapid extension is not a mere straighteningoutof adoubled-
up thread, but an actual growth. In oats and barley a
similar extension takes place; in the latter case the fila-
ments may be seen, under an ordinary pocket lens, to be
visibly growing at the rate of six inches an hour. The
result at which Mr. Wilson arrives is, that the " European
cereals are self-fertilised, and that the act of fertilisation,

On the Mechanical Work done in exhausting a Muscle
I HF.G leave to make some reply to the comments (NATURE,
vol. xi. pp. 464, 488) of Prof. Haughton on my paper.
I. In regard to the relative value of my earlier and later expe-
riments, it is to be said, that in one sense they are all equally
valuable. My object, however, was to find the work of exhaus-
tion when the intervals of work and rest were equal, the work to
be expended only in lifting the weight. Hence the experiments
were made in such a wayjas to eliminate the fatigue caused by
the falling weight. Prof. Preston and myself practised for several
weeks, until we were able to keep accurate time, before the
published series was begun. All who saw the experiments were
tl.en satisfied that the later method of experiment was an im-
provement. The two series first published were made with equal
care, and I am therefore at some loss to know what has been
Prof. Haughton's criterion in deciding that one was good and

when it was said that the co-ordinated values of - and n't formed a
t
curve, the meaning could only have been that /3 is not a constant.
Prof. Haughton is of course right in saying that the observations
thus co-ordinated "may be represented by a straight line." He
might also have added that for properly chosen limits, any other
observations may also be represented by a straight line. The
point is, whether these lines give any evidence of regular devia-
tions. It seems to me that "any one accustomed to such obser-
vations" ought to be able to see such evidence in the diagrams
of Prof. Haughton in NATURE, loc. fit. In this connec-
tion I wish to give a series of experiments, the time of lift /
being variable and equal to the interval of rest. The values of
n are the means of four experiments, and are uncorrectecl for
variations in strength. The experiments were made with the
apparatus described in my last paper (NATURE, vol. xi. pp. 256,

Haughton refers the difficulty to my experiments, and I refer the

5. Prof. Haughton objects to my reduction for variations in
strength. In reply, it is to be said that an increase of from

caused « to vary from 78 to 1366. The weight used was 5*00

thus greatly. I therefore conclude that this reduction is not

P.S.—I find that one important point in Prof. Haughton's
paper has been overlooked in my reply. Objection is made to
my last series of experiments, on the ground that all the muscles
thrown into action are not exhausted. If this objection is well
taken, it applies also to the former series of mine, so "highly
confirmatory of the Law of Fatigue," the agreement of which
with Prof. Haughton's formula is so "complete and satisfactory."

Domestic Economy of Blackbirds
Two Blackbirds having built their nest in full view of my
bedroom window, I have been much interested in watching the
process of feeding their young, &c. The cock bird is the prin-
cipal forager, and the food generally brought are worms. My
object in writing is to draw attention to one feature which may
be unknown to most of your readers as relates to the disposal of
the young birds' droppings. If left in the nest, it would become
filthy, if thrown aside the accumulation would lead to detection,
and I believe the general impression is that the old birds carry
the soil away; but on watching them closely I never saw the
droppings carried away but on one occasion, and that by the
hen ; in every other instance after being fed, the young birds in
turn lift up their tails and the droppings are taken by the old
bird and actually swallowed. On the 15th July the young birds
being fully fledged, were literally washed out of their nest by the
downpour of rain on that day, but, with a little care, they all
survived. On the 22nd the hen again returned to her nest,
and she is now sitting closely on three eggs, and I hope to get
the next brood photographed. I enclose my card and address,
and should any readers of NATURE desire to witness what I have
described, I shall be very glad to afford them an opportunity.

quarters of an hour. From the data published by Coum-
bary we might infer on the hypothesis of circular motion,
that the body, whatever its nature, had moved at a dis-
tance of about 415,000 miles from the sun's surface, and
as we know from the experience afforded by the great
comet of 1843, there is nothing improbable in a comet
having so passed. Perhaps when the sun's disc is more
systematically and widely watched, a comet may be caught
in transit and properly observed. The case of the comet
of 1819 is not a satisfactory one, Pastorff's observation at
least attributing to it a position upon the sun's disc which
it could not have occupied at the time he assigns to his
observation.
Comet 1874 (II).—The comet detected by M. Coggia
at Marseilles on April 17, 1874, which presented so fine
an appearance in our northern heavens in July, was
observed at Melbourne, and by Mr. Tebbutt, near
Sydney, until the end of the first week in October.
Comparing the Melbourne observation on the 6th of
this month with the place given by the elliptic ele-
ments of Prof. Tietjen, the difference is found to be less

than a minute of arc, and the European observations
to the middle of July are very accurately represented by
these elements. Between April 17th and October 6th
the comet traversed an arc of 2050 of true anomaly, and
the near agreement of Prof. Tietjen's orbit throughout,
shows that the comet when it attracted so much attention
was really moving in an ellipse of very long period,
though no doubt this element may be considerably varied
without largely increasing the differences between calcu-
lation and observation. The period of revolution in
Tietjen's ellipse is nearly 9,000 years. When a similar
complete investigation has been made for this comet to
that so skilfully performed by Dr. von Asten in the case
of Donati's great comet of 1858, some kind of limits may
be assigned to the time of revolution, but in all proba-
bility it must extend to some thousands of years. We
remark that the Melbourne observations of Coggia's
comet were made with a telescope of only \\ inches aper-
ture; no doubt the comet might have been followed some
time longer with larger instruments, but it is possible
that the Melbourne reflector may have been under pre-
paration for the transit of Venus, and not conveniently
available for cometary observations.

rT,MJS paper is in continuation of a similar paper pub-
•l ivjished in July last year, in which the American
Weather Maps for 1872-73 were discussed. The results
then arrived at are compared with the observations of
1874, and the whole is thereafter combined into a three
years' average.
The principal conclusions from the three years' obser-
vations are these :—
The mean direction of the onward course of storms is
N. 8i° E., or a little to the north of east, being most
southerly in July (E. 7° S.), and most northerly in April
and October (N. 720 E. and N. 74° E.). The mean
velocity is 26 miles per hour—the maximum monthly
velocity, 32 miles, being in February, and the minimum
i8'4 miles in August. As regards particular storms, wide
deviations from these figures take place, it being found
that the actual motion of the storm's centre may have a
path in any direction whatever, and the velocity of pro-
gress may vary from 15 miles per hour towards the west,
to 60 miles per hour towards the east. From the tri-
daily observations it is found that the average velocity of

planation of the advantages of the horizontal telescope
and its origin.
I should not have thought it worth while to make any
communication on this subject, but since it has been a
matter of discussion in the French Academy, and several
pamphlets have been written on the subject, it may not
be uninteresting to explain here the connection of the
Observatory of Harvard College with it.
In the spring of 1869, when it became necessary to
begin preparations for observations of the Solar Eclipse
of August 7th of that year, my attention was called espe-
cially to the subject of Solar Photography for the first
time. Mr. Warren De La Rue in England, and Mr.
Rutherford in America, had devoted themselves almost
exclusively to astronomical photography for many years,
and they were the authorities on this subject. The
methods employed by them were substantially the same;
each used an equatorial telescope with clock move-
ment, and enlarged the image formed by the object-glass
by means of another system of lenses, and photographed

this magnified image. Mr. De La Rue corrected his
object-glass to secure as nearly as possible the foci
of chemical and visual rays, and Mr. Rutherford cor-
rected his so as to obtain the best echromatic combi-
nation of the chemical rays without regard to the visual
focus.
Mr. De La Rue first undertook a series of daily photo-
graphs of the sun at Kew some time previous to 1860.
In making my own preparations for the Solar Eclipse of
1869, I collected what information I could about the
extent and brightness of the corona, and the nature
of Mr. De La Rue's photoheliograph which he em-
ployed in observing the total eclipse of 1860 in Spain.
In the first part of the volume of 'the "Philosophical
Transactions" for 1869, I found a paper which was read
May 31, 1868, which contains the results of the first at-
tempt to measure the helipgraphical positions and areas
of sun-spots observed with the Kew photoheliograph.
From the examinations of the measurements in this
paper I became convinced that no trustworthy measures
of photographs taken in this way could be made. The
magnified image is so much distorted by the eyepiece, or
the equivalent system of lenses used to form the image in

centre to the circumference of the image ; and even if this
irregular scale could be investigated, a slight;displace-
ment of the centre of the picture from the ajtis of the
telescope would introduce confusion. Mr. D« La Rue's
method o'f investigation consisted in photog/aphing the
pinnacle of a pagoda which was composed pi rings and
chains of known dimensions, and then attempting to find
the scales of the different parts of the pictures from the
images of this pinnacle.
The result, as I have said, satisfied rae' that this was a
method to be avoided. The difficulty arising from the
distortion of the image, and the app»ehension that the
light of the corona might be so ejpffebled by enlargement
that it would not make an impression on the plate, deter-
mined me to photograph the image in the principal focus
of the object-glass.
All of the many other parties fitted out for photograph-

De la Rue and Rutherford; the expedition from the Ob-

closing with the remark that if it should be successful the
glory would belong to France. Afterwards I received a
pamphlet of twenty-six pages, by Capt. Laussedat, in
which, ignoring me entirely, he tried to sustain his claims
against those of Faye, Foucault, and Fizeau.
In 1873, after the horizontal telescope had been in
successful operation for three years, after specimens, both
negatives and lithographic copies had been distributed in
Europe, the French Commission, which had up to this
time been making their preparations to use the method
of de La Rue, adopted the horizontal telescope. It would
appear from this, that whatever might have been done or
said on this subject by the Frenchmen named above, it
had not contributed much to a clear appreciation of the
advantages of the method until after they had been de-
monstrated here.
Without caring anything about credit for priority of
suggestion in such matters, being satisfied that no similar
instrument was in use or had been used before the one
at Harvard College, I was yet interested enough in the

matter to look up the claims put forth by these gentlemen,
and to see why they happened to be overlooked for so
long a time, even by their own countrymen. I find
that credit is accorded to Foucault, mainly for his per-
fection of the heliostat, both for the plane mirror and
for the uniform motion. He published nothing in re-
gard to its application to photography. After his death
his friend, St. Claire Deville, spoke of it as one of
the things that Foucault intended to do. He at the
same time contemplated the use of the siderostat in
e11 kinds of astronomical observations. M. Laussedat
is unwilling to give him any share of credit for the hori-
zontal telescope. M. Faye gives him credit only for the
heliostat.
M. Faye himself took some photographs of the sun
with a very long telescope of one M. Porro, of 15 meters
focal length. The telescope was pointed directly at the
sun. M. Faye's remarks on them before the Academy
related only to the advantage of their size and their distinct-
ness. He had nothing to say about the peculiar advantages
of the long telescope, but he anticipated all succeeding
inventions in the application of Photography to astronomy
by predicting its early use in meridian and every other
class of observations.
His next communication on this subject was on March
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
14, 1870, on the occasion of presenting a letter from M.
Laussedat on the subject of a horizontal telescope. This
was six months after my apparatus was ordered, and after
some experiments had been made with it. In this
communication he appears at first glance to have
suggested the whole arrangement now adopted; but
on closer examination he does not seem to have had any
clear ideas about it. He recommends the use of a long
telescope because he had seen good pictures with a long
telescope ; he nowhere speaks of his reasons for dispensing
with the eyepiece, and in fact it does not clearly appear
that he did dispense with it. In September, 1872, after
it had been in use for two years and several accounts
of it had been published, in his comments before the
Academy on a paper of Warren De la Rue's, he seems to
have understood for the first time the true theory of the
long horizontal telescope.
Capt. Laussedat appears to have the most substantial
claim of any that have been mentioned thus far. He used
a horizontal telescope in Algeria in i860, in observing the
total eclipse of that year; but he used a very short tele-

they should be turned upside down and read from right

on the simple dictum of Dr. Galabin that inverted tracings,
as above explained, are developed; that every elevation
in the apex cardiograph trace is the result of a movement
which is represented by a fairly proportionate fall in a
trace a little distance from that spot ; that every apical
propulsion is a lateral suction? This may possibly be the
case, but it requires a considerable amount of proof before
it can be accepted as true. The relative duration, or, in
other words, the horizontal projections of the different
undulations, is not in favour of the assumption, which
seems to be based on an accidental similarity between
that apex trace and the reversed one from its neighbour-
hood. Till Dr. Galabin introduced his view, it has been
assumed that the negative trace differs from the other
positive trace in the fact that in the latter some of the
undulations are longer in the up than in the down stroke;
whilst in the former the reverse is the case. There is need
for positive disproof of this explanation before the other
is even considered.

Dr. Galabin concludes that the second main systolic
rise " corresponds in time to the maximum contraction of
the ventricle," and that it is due to the locomotion of the
heart, dependent on the consequent injection of the aorla
and the propulsion of the blood. This explanation
might be tenable were it not for the results obtained by
the employment of the hxmodromometer of Chauveau,
tracings taken with which can be found in Marey's
"Circulation du Sang" (p. 273). These show that
there is a regurgitant current in the carotid arteries for
some appreciable period before the closure of the aortic
valve, which can only exist in connection with a similar
one in the ventricular cavity. It is the hasmodromomcter
trace which has led the writer of this article to lay more
than usual stress on the interval between the termination
of the cardiac systole and the moment of closure of the
aortic valves, termed by him the diaspasis.
Dr. Galabin remarks, "Mr. Garrod attributes the ele-
vation d (the first main systolic rise), solely to the loco-
motion of the heart caused by the lengthening of the
aorta. The rise / (the second main rise) he considers to
intervene between the end of systole and the closure of
the aortic valves, and to be due to the initial relaxation of
the ventricle. It appears to be impossible that the relax-
ation of the ventricle, apart from its repletion, could pro-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
duce an elevation in the curve except in those cases in
which its hardening produces a depression either at the
commencement or towards the conclusion of systole."
In the explanation here referred to the elevation under
consideration is, however, not supposed to be the result
of the relaxation of the muscular walls of the ventricles,
or to have anything to do with that phenomenon, but to
be caused by the reflux of blood from the aorta and pul-
monary artery into the ventricles which, when it has
attained a sufficient velocity, closes the semilunar valves.
Dr. Galabin, by employing the stethoscope in conjunc-
tion with the cardiograph, watching the development of
the trace whilst listening to the heart-sounds, has been
able to satisfactorily verify the observation that the first
sound occurs during the primary up-stroke, and that the
instant at which the second sound is heard corresponds to
a point on the principal down-stroke, and before the
succeeding small and constant rise. This is further
verified by the superposition of the sphygmograph trace on
the cardiograph trace taken at the same time, a method
which has elsewhere been shown to lead to particularly

"But while we thus emphatically express our sense of

mathematics. These studies, which stretch back to the
period of Greek civilisation, have grown with the deve-

are the instruments of the abstract investigation of physi-
cal laws. But we have also sought to place the school

endeavour to solve these questions by introducing in the
junior forms the cultivation of the faculties of observation
by the practical study of botany and physical geography,
for both of which this neighbourhood affords consi-
derable opportunities. For somewhat more advanced
students we have built a good chemical laboratory, and
we are about to extend this building so as to provide
separate rooms and apparatus, and for the practical study
of experimental physics. The thorough knowledge of
any branch of experimental science involves an acquaint-
ance with the instruments and modes of investigation, as
well as skill in manipulation. These are not to be ac-
quired from books. It is indispensable that pupils should
become familiar with the phenomena of the operation of
natural forces. They must learn to observe, to practise
the philosophy of induction by following the footsteps of
the great masters of research in preparation for inde-
pendent efforts. The faculties exercised in such pursuits
are not altogether the same as those employed in literary
studies. They may be compared without the deprecia-
tion of either. The student of literature has opportunities
to cultivate what is metaphysical—whatever relates to art,
to poetry, to history, philosophy, or language; while the
student of nature may more successfully develop the facul-
ties of observation and those brought into play in the

processes of inductive and deductive reasoning. The
search for hidden truths trains the ripe student in habits
of scrupulous exactitude. To record such observations is
an exercise in accuracy of thought and language.
"The scientific habit of mind which is the result of a
thorough practical training in one or more branches of
science is not to be attained by any devotion to language
or literature, just as the development of taste in litera-
ture, or of critical skill, or of the power of philological
research and discovery cannot be gained in the labora-
tory. These distinctions between literature and science
are in harmony with the diverse capacities of boys, and
they may be employed as auxiliaries in the development
of boys of limited or one-sided capacity. Some pupils
who have low grammatical and linguistic power may yet
exhibit facility in mathematical processes. Others in
whom both these faculties are feeble, awaken to intel-
lectual life as observers of nature. To some minds the
facts and principles of science become easy only when
they are in contact with the actual phenomena. Hence

science has recently been introduced by the appointment
of skilled teachers, by the building of laboratories and the
establishment of museums, and by the regulations of the
commission of public schools as to the time to be allotted
to such studies. Among our provincial grammar schools
Manchester has provided laboratories and the means of
highly skilled scientific instruction. At Burnley, also,
laboratories have been built, and the head master, Mr.
Hough, is distinguished by his scientific knowledge and
practical skill. He, doubtless, will diligently employ the
means at his command. The Commission on Scientific
Instruction has carefully collected the experience of the
schools which have introduced practical scientific teach-
ing. They strongly recommend that such instruction
should take its place at the side of that which is literary
throughout the whole school course. We had practically
anticipated this suggestion at Giggleswick. I do not
prominently put forward the adaptation of such studies to
the wants of the great manufacturing districts of York-
shire, Lancashire and Cumberland, which are contiguous
to us, or of the Durham and Northumberland coalfield.

as well as of those engaged in scientific professions, will
complete their education at school. In these trades and
professions the practical commencement of a scientific
training is often of great value. As I have already said,
it forms the scientific habit of mind; it familiarises the
youth with the phenomena of the operation of natural
laws, and with the manipulation of instruments. It deve-
lopes the faculty of observation and the power of inductive
and deductive reasoning. Moreover the facts of physical
science learned in the laboratory are an invaluable posses-
sion to the engineer, the chemist, the miner, the physiolo-
gist,andtoevery professional man who has to use these facts,
principles, and processes as a part of his daily occupation.
This school is intended to offer, in the first place, a sound
preparation in elementary knowledge in the English lan-
guage, its grammar, composition, and some acquaintance
with English history and literature. Within the range of
its studies are the ancient classical literature and modern
languages. It would fail in its purpose if the humble
elements of arithmetic were not faithfully cultivated as
the basis of mathematical knowledge and scientific calcu-
lation. It is on this broad basis that we wish and hope
to rear the structure of a sound and scientific culture.

in future to be the relative positions of the literary and
scientific education of our youth? How, as in this
school, can the financial resources be developed so as to
provide laboratories, and a larger skilled staff of teachers,
in order to ensure a sound literary culture, together with
scientific instruction? Inseparable from these questions
is the formidable one, Whence ate the skilled teachers of
science, capable of giving practical instruction in labora-
tories to be provided, if science in this sense is to form
part of the curriculum of all schools? Where the income
of the school is small, that difficulty is at present insur-
mountable, for a separate science master cannot be
afforded in such schools. Nor will it be removed until
some means be devised for the training of teachers by
which they v ill be enabled to add practical skill in scien-
tific instruction to a sound basis of literary culture. Then
a single master may fulfil the double function in a school.
The commission on scientific instruction points to this,

is under the average, and in most cases very considerably so.
At Aberdeen the rate below the average is 18 per cent, during
each of the months, July, August, and September ; and at Dublin
the annual minimum occurs in July, when the death-rate falls
25 per cent, below the average during the second and third

of the other English towns. \t Leicester, however, it shoots
up to twenty-two, and tweni) -four on the second and third weeks
of August. As regards the whole year, the lowest averages of
infant mortality are—Portsmouth, 4'9; London, 57 ; and Bristol,
5'9 : and the highest, Leeds, 8'4; Liverpool, 9'! ; and Leicester,
9-4. The season of minimum infant mortality is everywhere
during the spring months in the sixteen large towns of Eng-
land. The smallest spring mortality occurs at Portsmouth, the
smallest summer mortality at Bristol, the largest summer mor-
tality at I^eicester, and the largest mortality during the other
nine months of the year at Liverpool.
Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the mortality from diarrhoea
through the weeks of the year, in six large towns, the curves
being constructed similarly to, and on the same scale as, those
of Fig. I.
The differences in the rates of mortality from diarrhoea indi-
cated by these curves, which are strictly comparable inter se, are
very great, and a comparison of the two extremes, Leicester and
Edinburgh, is startling ; the figures showing that for every one
who dies from diarrhoea in Edinburgh during the summer

tion to the population.
From the beginning of November to the summer solstice, the
mortality from diarrhoea is everywhere small, being double, how-
ever, in Liverpool and Manchester as compared with London
and Portsmouth. It will be observed from Fig. 2 that the curves
begin to open out and diverge from each other in the end of
June. The curve for Edinburgh on no week reaches the annual
rate of 2 per 1,000 of the population. The highest for any week
are—Bristol, 3'6; Portsmouth, 3'9; London, 5°5 ; Liverpool,
io-5 ; and Leicester, 15-8, these two last places again standing
higher than any other of the towns.
The following is a list of all the large towns of Great Britain,
arranged in the order of the greater or less prevalence of fatal
cases of diarrhoea, during July, August, and September, the
figures being the average weekly death-rate for the thirteen
weeks, calculated on the annual mortality per 1,000 of the popu-
lation :—In England: Leicester, 9'56; Salford, 7'I5 ; Leeds,
7'O2; Manchester, 7'dO; Liverpool, 6'z8; Sheffield, 6'2O;
Birmingham, 578; Hull, 5-56; Nottingham, 5*36; Norwich,

Greenock, 175; Paisley, 171 ; Leith, 1-45; Edinburgh, 1-23;
Perth, I'08; and Aberdeen, 0-96.
From these results it will be seen that the influence of climate
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
is unmistakable. The summer temperature of the Scottish
large towns is several degrees lower than that of the English
towns, and we see that every one of the Scottish towns has a
mortality from diarrhcea lower than the lowest mortality of any
one of the English towns. Of all the large towns of Great
Britain the lowest death-rate from diarrhoea is that of Aberdeen,
which is at the same time characterised by the lowest summer
temperature. Further, the diarrhoea mortality of each town is
found from year to year to rise proportionally with the increase
of temperature, but the rate of increase differs very greatly in
different tva/ns. This points to other causes than mere weather,
or the relative temperature and humidity of the place, as deter-
mining the absolute mortality. Thus the summer temperature
of Dundee and Perth is nearly the same, and that of Glasgow
and Edinburgh is also nearly alike, the excess being rather in
favour of Perth and Edinburgh ; and yet the diarrhcea mortality
of these two towns is respectively less than that of Dundee and
Glasgow. It may therefore be assumed that there is something
in the topographical, social, or sanitary conditions of Dundee
and Glasgow, which intensifies the evil effects of hot weathei on
the health of the people, so as to swell, for instance, the death-

servation which metaphysicians employ," or any other that might
help them to see that intelligence is not a juice.

THE SCIENCE COMMISSION REPORT ON
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
SINCE our last week's issue two Reports of the above
Commission have been issued, one of them, the
Eighth and Final Report, dealing especially with the
Advancement of Science.
We attach so much importance to this branch of the
inquiry entrusted to the Commission, that we shall deal
with the Eighth Report first; and as the Recommendations
which the Commission make and the Considerations which
have led up to them have long been anxiously looked for,
we shall defer any remarks of our own this week, in order to
give the Considerations and Recommendations in exlenso.
The following are the various branches into which the
Report is divided :—
1. The Scientific Work carried on by Departments of
the Government.
2. The Assistance at present given by the State towards
the promotion of Scientific Research.
3. The Assistance which it is desirable the State should
give towards that object.

4. The Central Organisation which is best calculated
to enable the Government to determine its action in all
questions affecting Science.
The general remarks made by the Commission on the
evidence adduced on the first three heads are as follows:—
"The great advances in physical science which have
been made in this country, and within this century, by
such men as Dalton, Davy, and Faraday, without aid
from the State; the existence of our numerous learned
societies, and the devotion of some few rich individuals
to the current work of science, at first sight appear to
reduce the limits within which State aid to research is
required in this country.
"But whilst we have reason to be proud of the contri-
butions of some great Englishmen to our knowledge of
the aws of nature, it must be admitted that at the present
day scientific investigation is carried on abroad to an
extent and with a completeness of organisation to which
this country can offer no parallel. The work done in this
country by private individuals, although of great value, is
small when compared with that which is needed in the
interests of science; and the efforts of the learned societies,
not excepting the Royal Society, are directed to the dis-
cussion and publication of the scientific facts brought
under their notice ; these societies do not consider it any
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
part of their corporate functions to undertake or conduct
research.
"It will have been seen, from the extracts from the
evidence, that amongst the witnesses who have advocated
an increase of State assistance are some who have made
great sacrifices in time and money in the cause of scien-
tific research.
"But whatever may be the disposition of individuals to
conduct researches at their own cost, the advancement of
modern science requires investigations and observations
extending over areas so large and periods so long that
the means and lives of nations are alone^ commensurate
with them.
"Hence the progress of scientific research must in a
great degree depend upon the aid of Governments. As a
nation we ought to take a share of the current scientific
work of the world; much of this work has always been
voluntarily undertaken by individuals, and it is not desir-
able that Government should supersede such efforts; but

results of experiments in the laboratory, they are entirely
different from those of Mathematical Astronomy.
"Our opinion as to the desirability of such an institu-
tion is confirmed by the example of foreign nations;
observatories for astronomical physics being already at
work in various parts of Italy, and their immediate erec-
tion having been determined on at Berlin and at Paris.
"We venture to express the hope that similar institu-
tions may before long be established in various parts of
the British Empire. The regularity of the climatic con-
ditions of India, and the possibility .of obtaining there
favourable stations at considerable heights, render it
especially desirable that arrangements should be made
for carrying on physical observations of the sun in that
country.
"3. With respect to Meteorology we are of opinion
that the operations of the Meteorological Office have
been attended with great advantage to science and to the
country. The subject of Meteorology is a very vast one,
and any scheme for its proper cultivation or extension
must comprise—(i) Arrangements for observing and regis-

tering meteorological facts; (2) Arrangements for the
reduction, discussion, and publication of the observa-
tions ; (3) Researches undertaken for the purpose of dis-
covering the physical causes of the phenomena observed.
The resources placed at the disposal of the Committee
are inadequate to cover the whole of this wide field ; and,
having due regard to all the circumstances of the case,
we believe that in selecting certain parts of it, as the
objects of their special attention, they have been guided
by a sound discretion.
"We are also disposed to consider that although, as
we have already said, the Meteorological Committee
occupies an anomalous position, no other form of organ-
isation could advantageously have been adopted under
the actual conditions. We think, however, that if, as we
shall hereinafter recommend, a Ministry of Science should
be established, the head of the Meteorological Office
should be made responsible to the Minister. We fully
concur with the opinion expressed by the witnesses that
many branches of meteorology can only be effectually pro-
moted by an organisation having the support of Govern-
ment ; and we would draw especial attention to the con-
sideration that if meteorology is to take rank as a branch
of terrestrial physics, the observations must be made at
stations widely dispersed over all parts of the earth's sur-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
face, and those taken by observers of different nations
must be so arranged as to be comparable with one an-
other. It is obvious that the intervention of Government
would greatly facilitate the attainment of both these
objects.
"We are very unwilling that any scientific observations
which can adequately be carried on by individuals or
associations of individuals, should be undertaken by a
department of the Government. So far- as the local in-
terests connected with climatic meteorology suffice to
ensure due attention being paid to that branch of science,
we should prefer to see it left mainly to scientific societies,
any assistance the Government might afford being merely
subsidiary. That useful results may be obtained by
voluntary effort is evident from the work carried on under
the direction of Mr. Glaisher, and from the case of the
Scottish Meteorological Society, which has succeeded,
with very narrow means, in organising a valuable system
of observations on the meteorology of Scotland. It is,
however, important that any grants for the promotion of
meteorological observations in aid of voluntary efforts

we point out that under one or other of these heads are
included all scientific questions affecting the army, the
navy, the public health, the mercantile marine, public
works, Government scientific establishments; the ele-
mentary instruction in science under the department of
education in primary schools, in the science classes con-
nected with the Science and Art Department, and in
secondary schools so far as they are subject to Govern-
ment control; the aid which is now given, or which it is
desirable should be given, to universities and other bodies
not directly connected with the State, for the middle and
higher scientific instruction, and the control which the
State either does or should exercise over them in virtue
of such aid or otherwise; the appointments to all scien-
tific offices in the gift of the Crown; grants to museums
and their control by the State; aid to scientific expedi-
tions of every kind; the establishment and direction of
State laboratories and observatories; grants in aid of
such laboratories not under State direction, and in aid of

scientific research; and generally the allotment and con-
trol of public funds for similar purposes.
"The majority of the witnesses who have given evi-
dence in relation to this branch of the inquiry, express
dissatisfaction with the manner in which questions under
the preceding heads are now determined, and either re-
commend the appointment of a special minister of science
or of a minister of science and education.
"In most cases the witnesses recommend that such a
minister should, in regard to science, be advised by a
council. Others, however, are of opinion that the func-
tions of such a council might be exercised by an adminis-
trative staff of the usual kind."
After adducing a mass of evidence with regard to this
subject, the establishment of a Ministry and Council of
Science, the Commission thus discusses it:—
"We have given careful consideration to this part of
the Inquiry entrusted to us; and, in the course of our
deliberations we have been led to attach much importance
to the facts stated in the first part of our report, which
show that the scientific work of the Government is at
present carried on by many different departments.
"There is nothing to prevent analogous, if not actually
identical, investigations being made in each of these, or
to secure to one department an adequate knowledge of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
results obtained, and the circumstances under which they
¦were obtained, by another.
"Investigations admitted to be desirable/nay, practical
questions, the solution of which is of the greatest impor-
tance to the public administration, are stated by the
¦witnesses to be set aside because there is no recognised
machinery for dealing with them; while, in other cases,
investigations are conducted in such a manner as to
involve a needless outlay of time and money, because they
¦were originally planned without consultation with com-
petent men of science.
"Passing to the question of the advancement of science,
we have arrived at the conclusion that much has to be
done which will require continuous efforts on the part of
the administration unless we are content to fall behind
other nations in the encouragement which we give to pure
science, and, as a consequence, to incur the danger of
losing our pre-eminence in regard to its applications.
"These considerations, together with others which have
come before us in the course of our inquiry, have im-
pressed upon us the conviction that the creation of a

288

to the proper persons to be charged with the investiga-
tion.
"We are of opinion that the Council should not have
the power of initiating investigations ; it should, however,
not be precluded, in exceptional cases, from 'offering to
the Minister such suggestions as it may have occasion to
make in the public interest.
"We believe that reference to such a council would be
found to be so useful and convenient that it would become
the usual course in cases of difficulty, but we would not
diminish the responsibility or fetter the discretion of any
Minister by making such reference obligatory, or by pre-
venting a reference to committees or to individuals chosen
by him, whenever that course might appear to him to be
more desirable.
Finally the Report concludes with the following " Con-
clusions and Recommendations" :—
"I. The assistance given by the State for the promo-
tion of scientific research is inadequate, and it does not
appear that the concession or refusal of assistance takes
place upon sufficiently well-defined principles.

"II. More complete means are urgently required for
scientific investigations in connection with certain Govern-
ment departments; and physical as well as other Labora-
tories and apparatus for such investigations ought to be
provided.
"III. Important classes of phenomena relating to Phy-
sical Meteorology, and to Terrestrial and Astronomical
Physics, require observations of such a character that
they cannot be advantageously carried on otherwise than
under the direction of the Government
"Institutions for the study of such phenomena should
be maintained by the Government; and, in particular, an
observatory should be founded specially devoted to Astro-
nomical Physics, and an organisation should be esta-
blished for the more complete observation of tidal pheno-
mena and for the reduction of the observations.
"IV. We have stated in a previous Report that the
national collections of Natural History are accessible to
private investigators, and that it is desirable that they
should be made still more useful for purposes of research
than they are at present We would now express the
opinion that corresponding aid ought to be afforded to
persons engaged in important physical and chemical
investigations; and that whenever practicable such per-
sons should be allowed access, under proper limitations,
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to such laboratories as may be established or aided by
the State.
"V. It has been the practice to restrict grants of money
made to private investigators for purposes of research to
the expenditure actually incurred by them. We think
that such grants might be considerably increased. We
are also of opinion that the restriction to which we have
referred, however desirable as a general rule, should not
be maintained in all cases, but that, under certain circum-
stances and with proper safeguards, investigators should
be remunerated for their time and labour.
"VI. The grant of i,ooo/., administered by the Royal
Society, has contributed greatly to the promotion of
research, and the amount of this grant may with advan-
tage be considerably increased.
"In the case of researches which involve, and are of
sufficient importance to deserve, exceptional expenditure,
direct grants in addition to the .miaul grant made to the
Royal Society, should be made in aid of the inves-
tigations.

if this is admitted, the milligram of gold will contain
some 4o8i6,cx3ooco,oooooo"atorns in excess of the number
given above, and the omission of this will in itself show
the extreme generality of such statements. A curious
deduction as to ihe/orm of atoms is drawn from the fact
that many minerals are observed, when reduced to pow-
der, to preserve their normal crystalline form; hence,
says our author, "we conclude the compound atom
possesses form closely related to the cleavage form."
The law of Dulong and Petit is very concisely stated,
and its importance in modern chemistry is well illus-
trated. It is crudely formulated thus :—if a represents
the atomic weight and s the specific heat, the product
a s will be the specific heat .5" of a gram-atom of the sub-
stance, and S = a s nearly equal to 6'3-

The service afforded by the application of this law to the
determination of the right atomic weight of an element
is also shown in this case of lead, for from the analysis
of oxide of lead the atomic weight of lead might be 207,
or 103.5, or 69, or 414, or 621, for although we find
that sixteen parts by weight of oxygen are united with
207 of lead, we have no direct chemical proof that the
207 represents one atom; but the law of Dulong and
Petit now steps in and shows us that the right atomic
weight is 207, because it alone satisfies the conditions of
that law. And so for other elements the vapour density
of whose compounds cannot be determined. The section
on Atomicity or valence would be much improved by the
introduction of a complete list of the elements with their
atomicities, and a discussion of doubtful atomicities.
In the seventh section the author passes at once from
what were once called inorganic compounds to the discus-
sion of organic substitutions as shown in the great methyl

series of compounds. Such comprehensive statements
as, " the binary marsh gas,'also called methane, CH4, is the
basis of all organic compounds," are of great use to the
student, and in this instance the statement at once justifies
the passage from mineral chemistry to so-called organic
chemistry without one word of introduction or comment.
We do not think that the attempted graphical representa-
tion of chemical constitution in the eighth section can be
productive of anything but confusion J:o the'student. The
crosses and dots and three-limbed signs have themselves
to be remembered, and cannot give any, precise idea of the
constitution of a complex compound. A somewhat detailed
account of the constitution and syntheses of various serial
compounds concludes that portion of the work devoted to
Molecular Statics.
The second part commences with an account of the
motions of molecules, and it is asserted that since tnole-
culei are not spherical, their impact against each other
will not alone produce motion of translation, but also
motion of rotation, and this is partially illustrated by the
motion of a boomerang. The following definitions are

commonly known as the "Antarctic Expedition," took
place in 1839, and the four following years. Dr.
Hooker, under the title of "Assistant Surgeon" to
the Erebus, was the Naturalist of the Expedition,
and assisted by Messrs. M'Cormack and Robertson, the
medical officers of the vessels, made an extensive collec-
tion of specimens in every department of zoology and
botany. The botanical specimens were sent to Kew; the
zoological to the British Museum. Dr. Hooker under-
took the working out and publication of the former, and
Dr. Gray of the latter. At the recommendation of the
Admiralty the Government granted the sum of 2,oco/.
for the illustration of the work, half of which was assigned
to the botanical and half to the zoological portion. Dr.
Hooker's labours resulted in the two large quarto volumes
which form the well-known "Botany of the Antarctic
Expedition," and remain to the present day the standard
authority upon the plants of the southern hemisphere.
Very different were the results achieved by the thousand
pounds bestowed upon the zoological portion of the work.
After the publication of eighteen numbers, the various
sections assigned to the different naturalists were left, one

present day. Whether this untoward result was occa-
sioned by the fault of the editor or of the publisher, or
by misunderstandings between the two, has never been
divulged to the public, nor does it now much concern us
to inquire. Whichever may have been -the case, the
result was equally discreditable to the parties concerned.
It is with pleasure, however, we see that the scandal exists
no longer. An enterprising publisher has bought up the
'' remainder" of the plates of the unfinished work, and
made arrangements for its completion. Whether it was
justifiable on the part of the vendor to sell what had
been produced by public money may be open to some
doubt, but the purchaser, Mr. Janssen, is at all events
entitled to the credit of having done all he could to bring
this long neglected work to a satisfactory conclusion.
The six numbers of the "Zoology of the Erebus and
Terror" now before us, conclude the different sections,
and enable the subscribers after twenty years of patient
expectation to send their copies to the binders. On
turning over the pages of the lately issued numbers, we

Properties of Selenium
In a letter headed "Anomalous behaviour of Selenium,"
which appeared in Nature (vol. xiL, p. 187), Mr. Gordon
states that "it has lately been observed that the electrical
resistance of selenium is greater in light than in the dark." I
am anxious to learn where an account of this remarkable obser-
vation is to be found.
Mr. Gordon afterwards announces the discovery that a bar of
granular selenium belonging to the Cavendish Laboratory ex-
hibits a decrease of resistance under the influence of light. This
phenomenon was well-known outside the Cavendish Laboratory
more than two years ago. Mr. Gordon also states that the very
high resistance of a certain medal of selenium did not sensibly
alter under the influence of light; and concludes that "the
physical form of the metal" seems to have some influence on its
electrical properties. From his description of the medal it would

appear that it is made of vitreous selenium. I am therefore
surprised that its resistance was so low. A conducting form of
selenium having the appearance of black-lead is certainly a
novelty.
It is perhaps not generally known that the electrical properties
of selenium are very variable. In a paper by Mr. Henry Draper
and myself which appeared in the "Proceedings of the Royal
Irish Academy" (vol. i. ser. ii. (Sci.) p. 529), we have shown that
there is a granular variety of the element which is, at ordinary
temperatures, apparently as good a non-conductor as the vitreous
variety. Unlike the latter, however, it cannot be rendered elec-
trical by friction. Another granular modification of the element
was found to conduct electricity comparatively well in darkness,
and scarcely any better under the influence of light ; while there
is an intermediate state of the element which appears to possess
a molecular structure so susceptible of change, that light is
capable of converting it temporarily into the form which con-
ducts comparatively well. Some bars which we prepared of
this sensitive variety exhibited an increased conductivity of
100 per cent, under the influence of sun-light. In appear-
ance there is not the slightest difference between this and
the non-conducting granular variety, both exhibiting a gray
granular fracture resembling that of the metal cobalt. In
the course of our experiments Mr. Draper and I prepared a
large number of bars and plates of various shapes and sizes, but
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
we have not observed any unusual connection between the shape
of the bars or plates and their resistance. There is a great diffi-
culty in making observations with reference to this point, as we
are as yet unable to produce two or more bars of the sensitive
variety possessing the same electrical properties. Thin plates
are generally more sensitive to light than cylindrical bars, but
we have occasionally prepared bars as sensitive in proportion as
a plate measuring 75 x 15 mm., and only 0-5 mm. in thickness.
I have r.ot as yet been able to learn the contents of Prof.
Adams's recent paper on this subject, but Mr. Gordon says that
he has shown that the phenomenon is a purely optical one. I
may state that Mr. Draper and I have long since shown that, so
far as the effect of heat on electrical resistance is concerned,
some forms of granular selenium conform to the metallic type.
This was demonstrated by placing a plate of selenium inside a
spiral of platinum, at a distance of about 4 mm. from the wire.
The usual decrease of resistance took place when the plate was
exposed to light; but on heating the surrounding platinum wire
by passing a current of electricity through it, the resistance of
the selenium increased considerably. The effect of light is
therefore partially counterbalanced by the effect of the heat

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
KEPLER'S NOVA, 1604.—We learn from Prof. Winnecke
that, in consequence of the remarks upon this star which
appeared in NATURE, vol. xi. p. 249, he has lately
examined the neighbourhood, and, in addition to the star
of iri2th magnitude there mentioned—the position of
which for i855'o he finds to be R.A. 17!). 22m. 4'6s.,
N.P.D. ill0 23'6'—he found one of I2th magnitude in
R.A. I7h. 2im. 49/3S., N.P.D. 111° 19-3'. This star agrees
almost precisely in place with the loth magnitude marked
upon No. 52 of Chacornac's charts, though not at present
of that brightness ; but we are able to state that in August
1871 and June 1872 nothing was visible in this position in
a telescope which would show stars to I3'I4 magnitude
in Winnecke's scale. It will be desirable to watch this
small star closely, as it is quite possible it might be
identical with Kepler's famous star, the observed place of
which is not so accurately known as in the case of the
similar object observed by Tycho Brahe in 1572. Prof.
Winnecke, however, suggests that, as the star marked by
Chacornac is just upon the margin of his map, where
some distortion exists, it might possibly be identical
with No. 16,872 of Oeltzen's Argelander, a star estimated
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
8'9 in the Bonn Zones ; still the place of the I2th magni-
tude agrees much more closely with that of Chacornac's
loth, read off from his chart as nearly as the circumstances
permit. It may be well to compare the fainter star found
by Prof. Winnecke, from time to time with the iri2th
close at hand, and easily identified if the instrument be
set for Argelander"s star, which may be considered a bright
9th magnitude.
THE BINARY STAR 4 AQUARII.—If good measures of
this star are practicable during the present season, an
idea of the form of the orbit may perhaps be obtained.
Dawes's series of epochs will be of material service in
this respect; without them, doubt might have been occa-
sioned by the two discordant epochs of Madler, which
may have been owing to distorted images at low altitude.
The object is certainly one of considerable difficulty, and
really trustworthy measures are perhaps only to be ex-
pected from practised observers in command of instru-
ments of excellent definition. In Barclay's second cata-
logue it is described as just elongated in the direction

THE LATE W. J. HENWOOD, F.R.S.
THIS distinguished mining geologist, who died at
Penzance last week, in his seventy-first year, was
originally a clerk in the employment of Messrs. Fox, of
Falmouth, to whose counsel he was considerably indebted
in his early scientific work. By very great industry and
careful observation he acquired an unsurpassed knowledge
of the mineral deposits of Cornwall and Devon, and after
fulfilling a succession of important mining appointments,
he became Assay Master of tin to the Duchy of Cornwall.
This post being abolished, Mr. Kenwood's great expe-
rience was utilised in reporting upon and developing a
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
number of mining districts in South America, Canada,
&C.; and after the cessation of his travels, he lived at
Penzance in comparative retirement. His great works
are the fifth and eighth volumes of the " Transactions of
the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall," devoted respec-
tively to the metalliferous deposits of Cornwall and Devon,
and to those of the foreign countries he had visited. But
his scientific writings, besides these, were very numerous;
a list of them occupies seven columns in the " Bibliotheca
Cornubiensis."
As a scientific man Mr. Henwood was characterised by
indefatigable labour, great caution, love of accuracy, and
moderation of expression. In his publications he scarcely
ever mentions a fact of any kind which had not come
under his own experience, without giving the authority for
it. Thus many of his writings are marvels of copious
reference. He persisted in doing everything with this
extraordinary amount of labour and care up to the last,
notwithstanding that he suffered for many years from a
very painful heart-disease. His scientific work ceased
only with his death. So long as he could sustain even an
hour's intellectual effort during the day, that was devoted
to the arrangement of his stores of facts and observations.
I believe that scarcely one of his cherished objects in this
respect remains unfulfilled.

Mr. Kenwood's address to the Royal Institution of
Cornwall in 1871, extending, with references, to sixty-five
pages, affords ample evidence of the value of his observa-
tions and of his scientific ability. It includes the most
admirable and complete compendious account of the
mode of occurrence of metalliferous deposits in Cornwall
which has yet appeared, and is characterised by that
absence of theoretical assumption which specially marked
him as an observer. The orderly arrangement of accu-
rately-observed facts was his object; theorising he had
little affection for; suspended judgment on unproved
theories was his consistent attitude.
In personal character Mr. Henwood won the high
regard of all who knew him intimately. His acquaint-
ance with men and manners was so great and varied,
his memory so retentive, and his conversational style
so simple and lucid, that to talk with him was one
of the most delightful and instructive of intellectual
recreations. His estimate of his own labours and merits
was unaffectedly modest, although he would resist, if
possible, any unfair representation of his work.

of the quadrant, reserving the larger question of its exten-
sion to the entire sphere till the matter is brought before the

The question 'of ascending currents in the atmosphere

Faye's theories, however, have found very little support.

of the atmosphere in altitude, and the upper strata are in

We have received the "Fourth Report of the Meteorological,

daily observations made at the various meteorological stations,
the monthly means and extremes, and, as regards temperature
and rainfall, a comparison of the results of 1874 with the

From a letter from the Canada correspondent of The Scots,

The June number (just issued) of the Bulletin of the French
Geographical Society contains an interesting chart of the world,
by M. Maltc-Brun, intended to exhibit at a glance the propor-
tion of the known and unknown regions. Countries known in
their details are wholly covered with red, and those of which we
have a good general knowledge, with red having a slight dash
of white. White, with specks of red, indicates countries imper-
fectly known, while those entirely unknown are left in white.
Of course the various shades of red run into each other, but
countries unknown and imperfectly known considerably exceed
in extent the two other classes, so that there is little danger of
exploring and surveying parties wanting work for many years to
come. The greater part of Asia and America comes under the
two last categories, as also nearly the whole of Africa and
Australia; indeed, notwithstanding all that has recently been
done in the way of geographical discovery, the white at least
balances the red in Malte-Brun's chart.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER IN
THE LIQUID AND GASEOUS STATES*
'"THE investigation to which this note refers has occupied me,
-*• with little intermission, since my former communication in
1869 to the Society, "On the Continuity of the Liquid and Gaseous
States of Matter." It was undertaken chiefly to ascertain the
modifications which the three great laws discovered respectively
by Boyle, Gay-Lussac, and Dalton undergo when matter in the

gaseous state is placed under physical conditions differing greatly
from any hitherto within the reach of observation. It embraces
a large number of experiments of precision, performed at
different temperatures and at pressures ranging from twelve to
nearly three hundred atmospheres. The apparatus employed is,
in all its essential parts, similar to that described in the paper
referred to ; and so perfectly did it act that the readings of the
cathetometer, at the highest pressures and temperatures em-
ployed, were made with the same ease and accuracy as if the
object of the experiment had been merely to determine the
tension of aqueous vapour in a barometer-tube. In using it the
chief improvement I have made is in the method of ascertaining
the original volumes of the gases before compression, which can
now be know with much less labour and greater accuracy than
by the method I formerly described. The lower ends of the
glass tubes containing the gases dip into small mercurial reservoirs
lormed of thin glass tubes, which rest on ledges within the
apparatus. This arrangement has prevented many failures in
screwing up the apparatus, and has given more precision to the

the pressures at which carbonic acid gas liquefies. It gave,
indeed, the pressures exercised by the liquid when contained in
large quantity in a Thilorier's reservoir; but these pressures are
always considerably in excess of the true pressures in conse-
quence of the unavoidable presence of a small quantity of cam-
pressed air, although the greatest precautions may have been
taken in filling the apparatus. Even ^ part of air will exer-
cise a serious disturbing influence when the reservoir contains a
notable quantity of liquid.
Law of Boyle.—The large deviations in the case of carbonic
acid at high pressures from this law appeared distinctly from
several of the results given in my former paper. I have now
finished a long series of experiments on its compressibility at the
respective temperatures of 6°7, 63°7, and 100° Centigrade. The
two latter temperatures were obtained by passing the vapours of
pyroxylic spirit (methyl alcohol) and of water into the rectan-
gular case with plate-glass sides, in which the tube containing the
carbonic acid" is placed. The temperature of the vapour of
the pyroxylic spirit was observed by an accurate thermometer,
whose indications were corrected for the unequal expansion
of the mercury; while that of the vapour of water was

deduced from the pressure as given by the height of the
barometer and a water-gauge attached to the apparatus. At
the lower temperature (63'7) the range of pressure which
could be applied was limited by the occurrence of liquefac-
tion; but at the higher temperatures, which were considerably
above the critical point of carbonic acid, there was no limit of
this kind, and the pressures were carried as far as 223 atmo-
spheres. I have only given a few of the results; but they will
be sufficient to show the general effects of the pressure. In the
following Tables p designates the pressure in atmospheres as

OUR BOTANICAL COLUMN
FERULA ALLIACEA.—The late Mr. D. Hanbury was a valu-
able and frequent contributor to the Kew Museums, and the
very last contribution made, or rather bequeathed by him, has a
scientific as well as a melancholy interest. The specimen in
question was a line umbel, bearing ripe fruits of Ferula alliacta,
JJoiss., the label to which we believe was written at his dictation
just before his death. • Seeds of this plant were also received at
Kew from him some time before the receipt of this specimen,
and these have germinated, and, though healthy, are as yet
naturally very small plants. In the "Pharmacographia" Mr.
Hanbury refers to this plant as exhaling a strong odour of Asa-
fvi Ma, but says it is not known as the source of any commercial
product. In contradistinction of this, however, Mr. W. Dymock,
Professor of Materia Medica at Bombay, writing on the Asa-
foetidas of the Bombay market in a recent number of the
Pharmaceutical Journal, says that this plant produces one of the
distinct kinds known in the above drug market under the name

of "Abushaheree Iling," and is brought from the Persian Gulf
ports, principally from Abushaher and Bunder Abbas, and is
produced in Khorassan and Kirman. The specimens received
at Kew from Mr. Hanbury appear to have been first received by
him from the author of the paper in question, for he refers to
having sent such specimens; therefore, if the specimens are
authentic, there is no reason to doubt the truth of the statement
made by Mr. Dymock, that the drug which appears in the
Bombay Customs Returns as Hing or Asafcetida, is produced by
this plant. It arrives in Bombay either in skins sewn up so as
to form a flat oblong package, or in wooden boxei. Its appear-
ance varies according to age, being soft, and about the thickness
of treacle when quite fresh, and of a dull olive brown colour and
a pure garlic odour. It becomes hard and translucent and of a
yellowish brown colour after being kept some time. Slices of
the root are found mixed with the resin in about equal propor-
tion. In i8y2-73'as many as 3,367 cwt. of this drug were
imported into Bombay from the Persian Gulf. The information
given in the paper irom which we have quoted the above parti-
culars seems to be of a trustworthy nature, and will prove a
valuable addition to what we already know of the Asafcetidas.

by himself last winter to determine the degree of influence of
heat on the vegetation of the same species under otherwise
diverse conditions. The sudden burst into life and the rapid
development of the vegetation of northern regions is proverbial;
the advent of mild weather seems to bring at once into activity
the accumulated vital energies, and growth is exceedingly rapid.
In the south the same temperature would have far less visible
effect on the same species. De Candolle has attempted by
direct experiment to ascertain to what extent this influence is
exercised. For this purpose he procured specimens of several
common deciduous trees from Montpellier, and submitted them
to the same temperature as, and with, specimens of the same
species collected at Geneva. In the ordinary course of things
the same species came into leaf from three weeks to a month
earlier at Montpellier than at Geneva, but the specimens from
the south, by the side of the northern specimens, did not unfold
their leaves so early as the latter by about three weeks. The
White Poplar Hornbeam and Tulip Tree were the principal
trees employed. Catalpa, a very late leafing subject, exhibited
less diversity in this respect. This phenomenon is equally
striking in cereals and other cultivated plants. The learned

th;ee specimens yielded different species of Diatomacese, but
no new forms were detected. The coal for examination was
finely pulverised,\then placed in a piece of combustion tubing
and heated to redness, a gentle stream of oxygen being passed
over the substance. The temperature must not be raised too
high, in order not to fuse the siliceous skeletons of the Diato-
macea;. The residue is to be treated with nitric acid and chlo-
rate of potash, and heated, then washed carefully with distilled
water, and mounted in the usual way. The examination of other

IN our last issue we published the substance of the
Eighth and final Report of the Royal Commission

which includes the measures deemed by that body neces-
sary for the advancement of science in England.
We now propose to lay before our readers a summary
of the evidence on the above branch of the investigation
undertaken by the Commission. It must be borne in
mind that the evidence given on this topic fills a Blue
Book of more than 400 closely printed pages, and the
extracts from it with which the Commissioners fortify the
Report now under notice fill some forty pages. These
extracts; have been selected with obvious impartiality.
The further compression which it must undergo in order
to fit it for our columns must necessarily weaken the
force of the testimony borne by a cloud of able witnesses.
All we can hope to do, within our limits, is to give an
idea of some of the salient points established, and of the
general tendency of the whole.

it is Uue, apply lo individuals and sometimes to societies,
but in very many cases, I am afraid, the questions are
shelved, because there is no competent and authoritative
body to refer to."
Capt. Douglas Galton, of the Office of Works and
Public Buildings, thinks that, as a rule—
"... Our statesmen do not appreciate properly the
value of scientific advice or scientific inquiry, and that
they are very much fonder of experiments made upon a
large scale with no defined system, than they are of expe-
riments which have been brought out as the result of a
carefully studied previous inquiiy. I think that an enor-
mous amount of money was wasted in the case of the
inquiry into armour plates, both for ships and forts. In
that case the Government appointed a partly scientific
committee, but it was mixed up with other persons who
were not scientific; and instead of commencing a series
of experiments upon a small and clearly defined scale,
from which they could have drawn conclusions for making
their larger experiments, they began by firing at any

plates that were offered to them which had no relation
one to another, either in their relations to the guns or to
the form of backing, or in any other way, and conse-
quently it was difficult to draw useful calculations from
them."
Mr. Froude, who was a prominent member of the late
Committee on Naval Designs, and who is now devoting
his whole time without remuneration to the investigation
of the proper forms of ships of war, states that if, at an
earlier time, a laboratory had existed, and proper experi-
ments had been made, enormous sums would have been
saved which have been expended in the actual construc-
tion of ships, or, as he terms it, in "experiments on the
scale of twelve inches to a foot;" and that definite results
would have been arrived at with less loss of time.
It will be seen from the evidence of General Strachey
that he also disapproves of the mode in which Government
is at present advised on questions of science, especially
on the ground of the absence of scientific training in the
political and official classes of this country.
Sir Wm. Thomson has given the following evidence :—
"... With a vast amount of mechanical work which
is necessarily undertaken by the Government, and which
is continually in hand, questions involving scientific diffi-
culties of a novel character frequently occur; questions
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
requiring accurate knowledge of scientific truth hitherto
undeveloped are occurring every day. In both respects
the Government is at present insufficiently advised, and
the result is undoubtedly that mechanical works are some-
times not done as well as they might be done, that great
mistakes are sometimes made; and again, a very serious
and perhaps even a more serious evil of the present sys-
tem, in which there is not sufficient scientific advice for
the Government, is the undertaking of works which
ought never to be undertaken."
"Are you able to point out any instances which you
have in your mind of mistakes which you think have
occurred from the want of good advice on the part of the
Government ?—One great mistake undoubtedly was the
construction of the Captain, and I believe that a perma-
nent scientific council advising the Government would
have made it impossible to commit such a mistake. They
would, in the very beginning, have relieved the Govern-
ment from all that pressure of ignorant public opinion
which the Government could not possibly, in the present
state of things, withstand."

per horse-power per hour. I see that there are very
many leakages or loss in steam-engines in the very best
way that we make them at present. The knowledge that
was gained by Joule's experiments a few years ago seems
to me to have been of immense value. Those experi-
ments that he carried out for himself were the sort of
thing which I think the Government should have done
for the sake of the country- He did more to make engi-
neers thoroughly dissatisfied with their present knowledge
with regard to what they can do with steam than any-
thing which had been done before. I believe that what
Mr. Joule did will do more lor this country than even
what James Watt did. The part that James Watt took
was very great, and the world gives him full credit for it,
but the world is scarcely willing to give credit to Joule
for what he will do; but he has made all engineers dis-
satisfied. They know that the best steam-engine is not
doing one-sixth of the work which it ought to do and can
do. That is a sad state of matters to be in when we
know that we are so far wrong, but yet no one will go to
the trouble of going to the end of the question so as to

improve the steam-engine as it might be done; in fact,
it will cost a great deal of trouble and a great deal of
expense, I have no doubt."
With regard to the question whether it is "desirable
that the Government should establish any laboratories
for carrying on those investigations," he thus stated his
opinion ;—
"I should like to see a grand laboratory fitted with
everything that would go towards the investigation of
such matters, and at the same time a testing apparatus
for getting at the physical facts as well. To get up the
proper plant would be very expensive, but still I should
like the nation to have it, so that any public department
could go to this same laboratory and ask them for assist-
ance to investigate any doubtful point."
Mr. Anderson's evidence finds a parallel in that given
by Mr. E. J. Reed, M.P., late Chief Constructor of the
Navy. He says :—
"I think that there are many branches of science
remaining undeveloped at present, the development of
which would be of great advantage to the country. 1
base that opinion partly upon the experience which I
acquired at the Admiralty, in which I continually found
that great and important questions were undeveloped for
the want of organisation and of the means of developing

"... A second illustration which I should like to give
is this: the present condition of the marine steam-engine
and boiler is very unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory to
such an extent that I believe if the manufacture of iron
and steel were improved with reference to its use in the
construction of engines and boilers, and if improved
material were applied by improved methods, a saving of
one-half of the present weight would be attained; and
when I siy one-half, I know that 1 am speaking greatly
within the limits which some persons who have thought very
much about this question would be prepared to express.
Of course, if that be so, if we are carrying about in our
mercantile and other steamships twice the weight which
is essential for the production of the power, that is so
much taken off either from the further power and speed
which might be obtained, or from the freightage and com-
mercial value of the vessel.

of the experimental sciences, and as there are no public
laboratories available for the researches of private investi-
gators, it may be said that in many branches of experi-
mental science the State affords no permanent material
aid to such investigators."
Assistance of a permanent description is also afforded
to learned societies, by providing them with apartments
free of rent, or with annual grants of money in lieu of such
accommodation: the sum of yx>l. granted annually to the
Royal Geographical Society under certain conditions is
an instance of such a grant.
We may regard as a permanent aid to science the
grant of i,ooo/. for researches carried on by private indi-
viduals, which is annually voted by Parliament, and ad-
ministered by a Committee of the Royal Society.
The first proposal for such a grant was contained in a
letter (dated October 24th, 1849) from Earl Russell then
(Lord John Russell) to the then President of the Royal
Society (the Earl of Rosse), and was to the following
effect :—

and researches which cost money and assistance the
students of science can often but ill afford, I am induced
to consult your lordship, as President of the Royal
Society, on the following suggestion :—
"I propose that at the close of the year the President
and Council should point out to the First Lord of the
Treasury a limited number of persons to whom the grant
of a reward, or of a sum to defray the cost of experiments,
might be of essential service. The whole sum which I
could recommend the Crown to grant in the present year
is l,ooo/., nor can I be certain that my successor would
follow the same course; but I should wish to learn
whether, in your lordship's opinion and that of your
colleagues, the cause of science would be promoted by
such grants."
Lord Rosse, in reply to the proposal made by Lord J.
Russell, expressed his personal opinion that the judicious
employment of grants in the way proposed "would very
materially promote the advancement of science ;" and of
the two alternatives, namely, expending the i,ooo/. in
rewards, or appropriating it to the payment of the ex-
penses of experiments, he preferred the latter, indicating
his reasons as follows :—
"There are often details to be worked out before it is
possible to employ usefully newly discovered principles.

In many of the sciences reductions are required before
observations can be made use of. Both in science and
art, facts technically called constants are the materials of
discovery; to determine them accurately is of great im-
portance. Now in all these cases, and in many others,
the work to be done is laborious and expensive, and as it
adds but little comparatively to the fame of the indivi-
dual, it especially requires encouragement."
With regard to this "Government grant" Sir Edward
Sabine in his evidence says :..."! suppose that
the i.ooo/. in one year was designed as an experiment to
try the matter in the first instance. I always understood
that Lord Russell contemplated that the sum would be
augmented if the plan were found to work well."
No change however has been made either in the
amount of the grant or in its mode of distribution since
its first establishment.
As examples of the second—occasional—kind of aid,
expeditions for special researches, outfits of ships, and
apparatus and grants of money for such researches, are
mentioned. Great as is the value of these contributions,

was added as a complement. The treatises contributed
to this work by Herschel, Airy, De Morgan, Peacock,
Whately, Senior, and others, are some of the most pro-
found works in English scientific literature, and maintain
their scientific value after the lapse of forty years or
more. It was the weight of these too-valuable treatises
which damned the commercial success of the whole
scheme.
The "Encyclopaedia Britannica" has effected a com-
promise between the systematic and alphabetic methods
in another way, altogether inferior in a logical point of
view, but far more successful as actually carried into
effect. In this volume we have forty-four important
articles, almost every one of which is written by a master
of the subject, if not in every case by its most eminent
representative. The longest of these except one is that
on Astronomy, by Mr. R. A. Proctor. It occupies eighty
quarto pages, in addition to four large plates of en-
gravings, and might be easily made to fill a good-sized
octavo volume of 400 or 500 pages. This article is on the
whole a satisfactory compendium of the science, but it is
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
matter of regret that Mr. Proctor cannot avoid exhibi-
tions of bad taste. He has no right to insinuate in the
second column of p. 786 that two of the joint authors of
an important scientific paper are the assistants of the one
first named. The accuracy of some of Mr. Proctor's
statements as to the history of recent discoveries in solar
astronomy would have to be seriously called in question;
were it possible in an article of this kind to enter upon a
subject involving many details.
One of the most profound and at the same time
interesting articles is that of Dr. E. B. Tylor on Anthro-
pology, occupying about sixteen pages. As we should
expect from the principal founder of the new science, it
contains a luminous abstract of the evidence concerning
the antiquity, descent, and development of the human
race, mainly brought to notice since the last edition of
the " Encyclopedia" was published. Taken in connec-
tion with Prof. Daniel Wilson's article on Prehistoric
Arcluzolo^y, and Prof. St. George Mivart's elaborate
account of the Ape Family, filling twenty-one pages, we
have in this single volume of the work a full supply of
information relating to the origin and affinities of the
human species. It is curious to compare the views dis-
cussed in these articles with those propounded in earlier
editions of the "Encyclopaedia" under the title "Crea-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tion."
Probably the longest article in the volume is that, the
joint production of Prof. T. Hayter Lewis and Mr. G. E.
Street, upon Architecture, which, taken together with a
very useful glossary of architectural terms, extends over
ninety-four pages. If reprinted in a separate volume it
would form a convenient and much-needed text-book of
the science. As treated by Mr. Ferguson, the history of
architecture forms in fact one of the most instructive
branches of the new science of Sociology, and no subject
of study is better calculated to produce ^correct views of
the origin and development of civilisation. We are
unable to understand why the work of Mr. Ferguson is
referred to in the Bibliography of the subject (p. 457) only
under the head of Chinese Architecture.
It will be a matter of regret to many that Professor
Huxley's article on the Classification oj the Animal
Kingdom is restricted to six pages, but it is surprising
how many profound remarks he has managed to com-
press into this narrow compass. The article, however, is
only suited for the reading of experts. The article, again,

made. It is obvious that a mere reference under
the name Asteroid would have been sufficient. The
editor avoids the introduction of the copious references
which are to be found in the " Penny Cyclopaedia," " Rees1
Cyclopaedia," and many other ones, but he does not do
this consistently and completely. In olher cases subjects
of considerable importance are treated with the brevity
of a dictionary, and yet no references are added. Take,
for instance, the account of the word Anodyne given in
seven lines, and containing merely the meaning and ety-
mology of the name, and a list of six substances used as
anodynes. There is no reference to anaesthetics or any
other article where the subject might be fully studied.
Perhaps the worst article allowed to stand in this
volume is that under the word Angle, which tells us in
twenty-seven lines, and by aid of a figure, what an angle
is, what a right angle is, how the whole circumference is
divided into 360°, and so on, concluding by a reference to
geometry and trigonometry. Such a puerile description
of the word would not be tolerated in "Chambers' Infor-
mation for the People" or Cassell's Popular Educational

works. There is only a single sentence in this article
which could in all probability give new information to
any person likely to consult such a work as the " Ency-
clopaedia Britannica."
It is not our duty, of course, to form any judgment upon
the larger part of this volume, which treats of literary or
artistic subjects. The many articles treating of classical,
biographical, geographical, and other information are pro-
bably on the whole superior to the parts devoted to physical
and mathematical science. The scarcest and perhaps
the weakest articles altogether are those on mathematical
topics. There are, indeed, in this volume only two
articles of any length which can be called mathematical.
That on Annuities is a fair one, especially as supple-
mented by other articles to which reference is made.
That upon Arithmetic, however, is a very dry, perfunctory
production, chiefly consisting of a mere compendium of
the ordinary rules. We do not recognise the name of the
author by his initials, and the name is not made public
in the list of principal contributors. It is obvious that
the "Encyclopaedia Britannica" will not compare in the
mathematical department with the "Penny" or the
"English" Cyclopedias, which contain a splendid series
of articles by De Morgan of permanent interest and
value. While, therefore, we can entertain no doubt that,

taken as a whole, the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," as
now republishing, is excellently edited, we think that Prof.
Baynes is inclined to sacrifice in some degree the less
for the more popular branches of knowledge.
We are driven to this conclusion when we compare the
number and length of the articles given to the more
severe scientific subjects with those upon more popular
topics, such as Architecture and Archcrology. The
treatise on Armyf&gain, taken in connection with that
upon Arms and Armour, takes up a very large amount
of space. No doubt it is requisite that War, which occu-
pies unfortunately so large a part of the attention of
Europe at the present time, should be fairly noticed in an
"Encyclopaedia" intended for the use of all. It is a
matter of opinion and a question of degree and of propor-
tion in which it is hopeless for Prof. Baynes to please all
parties. But it^may be well to remind Prof. Baynes that
the more popular articles are those which will soon lose
their value. Such an article as that on Army rapidly
becomes antiquated by the progress of political and
social changes and of mechanical invention, whereas good

Why could not the record before us be published in
England as well as in America? This seems a very
feasible plan, and would doubtless add to the usefulness
of the work, inasmuch as English collaborateurs might
be added.
Very different from the American annual is the English
year-book, yet it is, we believe, the only "year-book of
science " of which we can boast. Outside it resembles a
shilling railway novel; inside it is a pleasant gossipping
account of odds and ends of science picked up at the
Royal Institution, An altogether disproportionate amount
of space is devoted to extracts from the papers and
addresses of Prof, Tyndall, and the woodcuts on the
title-page are taken from the same source. We are
glad, however, that the "Year-book of Facts" still
remains, notwithstanding the death of its former inde-
fatigable compiler. Mr. Vincent tells us he undertook at
short notice to continue the work of the late Mr. Timbs.
To compile a year-book under such circumstances can

Systems of Consanguinity
IN Sir John Lubbock's vindication of his original charge that
I seeir. to have two theories of the facts in my work on Consan-
guinity (NATURE, voL xii. p. 124), he fails to show that the
cias-sificatory system was interpreted by me as "arbitrary, arii-
ficial, and intentional." This is one of ihe theories, and in fact
the principal one, which he ascribes to me, and which I repu-
diate. The other theory, that which I did advocate, is presented
both in his address before the Anthropological Institute and in
this vindication (stated partially and imperfectly), ns something
that I "admit." "Mr. Morgan admits that systems of relation-
ship have undergone a gradual development, following that of
the social system." (Address, p. 4, NATURE, vol. xii. p. 125.)

In that chapter, entitled "General Results," the facts are dis-

Proposition I. That the systems of consanguinity given in the

one of which is called dfscriptin and tie other clasnftcatory.
The first is that of the Aryan, Semitic and Uralian families, and
the second that of the Malayan, Turanian, and Ganowanian
families.
Proposition II. That these systems are to be ranked as
domestic institutions.

accuracy, but having three, the readings of them cannot be ques-

We left Sandy Hook on the forenoon of April 10, with a light
north-west wind and pleasant weather. Temperature of the air
46, barometer 29-82. From that date to the i6th the ship
steamed 2,210 miles, and the mercury, with the exception of a
slight fluctuation which never exceeded j§5 of an inch, fell
steadily until it reached 29'14 on the latter day. Throughout
this period the wind veered and backed between N.N.W. and
E.N.E., never exceeding in force a whole sail breeze, and fre-
quently light or calm for hours together. The sky was generally
overcast until the meridian of 32° W. was passed ; light rain
fell once, but no snow or sleet. Temperature of the air ranging
between 34° and 57°.
Until the ship was to the eastward of Cape Race (passing 300
miles south of it), as no gale blew I expected a heavy fall of
snow; but as it did not come, I assumed that the snow- covered
ice on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland caused this unusual
depression of the mercury. Great was my surprise, therefore,
to see it falling lower as the distance increased from the supposed
cause of the depression, while the wind gradually died away, the
clouds opened out and assumed softer forms, the horizon cleared,

and the long northerly swell subsided. The latter is always a
sign of fair weather on this troubled sea. If a storm be advan-
cing towards a ship, the swell usually comes before the wind, so
quickly is the motion of the water translated.
While on the subject of waves, I may state that I have been
investigating the cause of the greater height of the waves raised
by a north-west wind above those raised by a south wind. The*
observations were made while crossing several offshoots of the
Gulf Stream, and I found thot in every instance the sea was
smoother in the warm water than in the colil. If this view be
correct, then the waves in tropical seas should be inferior in
height to those oi the temperate zone. The question is, Are
they so?
Snow has an extraordinary effect on the barometer, but its
action is most mysterious, as in this case the ship was several
hundred miles from any locality where snow could have fallen.
In March 1872 I witnessed a similar instance of great depres-
sion in the barometer, with no wind and a clear sky. On reach-
ing the land it was found to be covered with snow. In that
instance there was scarcely a cloud visible during the last 400
miles, and not a single flake fell on the ship. I believe the
remarks of an old seaman on the weather of the Atlantic are
very true, viz., "The longer one sails on it the less one knows
about it."

south as 4i°4o'N., only fifty miles north of the latitude of
Naples, has excited considerable astonishment amongst Atlantic
navigators, since many steamers were entangled in it as early as
the 24th of January.
The Admiralty Chart of 1873 indicates March as the first
month of its arrival, and further gives lat 42° 13' N. as the
extreme southern limit of its existence, whereas it has already
been met with twenty-seven miles south of that parallel, forming
a dangerous barrier to ships on the great highway to America:
and the commanders of those vessels, relying implicitly on the
correctness of a survey which should be above suspicion, have
seriously injured their vessels, thereby jeopardising many lives
and valuable property in a locality where every feature of it
should be as well known as the waters of the Serpentine or
the Thames above bridge. It is, moreover, notorious that this
is not the only defect in the chart of 1873. The northern limit
of the Gulf Stream is laid down from 100 to 150 miles south of
its true position ; and the existence of another important current
(the Labrador), which plays no mean part in the economy of
the globe, is entirely ignored, although its line of demarcation
from the adjacent waters is as well defined as that of its great

perhaps affected by error of copy, but as they stand they

With Dr. Duner's semi-axis and period, and Mr. Otto
Struve's first approximation to the annual parallax, the

It will be remarked that the angles in the above orbit

we may take this opportunity of directing attention to a

Bremiker, which will be found available not only in
double-star computations, but very generally for five-
figure work. The figures closely resemble those in De
Morgan's well-known tables (which are now apparently
out of print), and consequently are exceedingly clear and
readable, and the price nominal (one shilling). Several
miscellaneous tables and various useful constants are
appended. The work will be sent over in paper cover,

edges as materially facilitating their working. When

Such a work would be by no means without its value.

There are several of the revolving double-stars of which
much better orbits than have yet been published might

Of the fairly determined orbits, the shortest period
appears to be that of 42 Com.'c liercn—25*5 years,

flow could still take place in a northerly direction also from
Lake Aral. Some sixteenth century maps show the river
Obi flowing out of the lake of Kitay, which is one of the
names of Aral; and bvsuch an overflow may be explained
that supposed irruption of Ocean into Asia which the
most ancient Greek and Latin authorities have recorded.
Nor would the demonstration of the possibility of this
overflow in any way affect the reputation either of Hero-
dotus or of Aristotle, who both maintained the isolation of
the Hyrcanian from the ocean ; for the overflow from Aral
might or might not have taken place during a series of
years, depending as it did upon the magnitudes of the
annual floods of the rivers which supplied it, at the epoch
when the winter broke up, on the highlands of Central
Asia.
It was estimated in the note on the Hyrcanian Sea that
when the Oxus discharged directly westwards, the water-
sorcad of Lake Aral and the lands drowned bv its over-
t'ow might have added about 70,000 square miles to the

V.i^ides, for the volume which Oxus, Ochus, and Arius
probably supplied, the total area of the Hyrcanian Sea
would have been about 250,000 square miles, which would
have formed a waterspread almost reaching up to the
ridge which divides the Caspian from the Black Sea, i.e.
the level of the largest possible Hyrcanian Sea may have
been 89 feet above mean sea-level, in the lowest of the
two basins which formed it. The observations of Pallas
have, however, placed beyond doubt that the ancient
limits of the Caspian were situated at a much higher level
than this ; and since these limits, which are delineated in
a map illustrating his works, did not owe their existence
to the overflow from Aral, in conjunction with the volumes
of water delivered by the rivers of the Caspian basin,
they must have been formed by water flowing out of the
Euxine basin. And this latter could not consequently
have had at such a time a communication with the
Mediterranean Sea.
We know that at the present day a very much larger
volume than is required to compensate its surface evapo-
tion is contributed by the various rivers supplying the
Black Sea, and passes thence through the Bosphorus into
the Sea of Marmora. Before this escape existed, the level
of the Euxine would have been higher, and the surplus
waters would have overflowed to the east by the channel

and this latter circumstance was the one which almost
certainly occurred, and in a northern direction.
The part of the ancient shore of the Caspian, which
Pallas has delineated, and which is situated at a point
called Cholon Komyr, in latitude 45° 30' 25", and longitude
(east from Greenwich) 44° 51' 34", has a height of 221 feet
above the sea (b). In other words, the great inland sea of
fresh water, which extended from the western shores of
the Black Sea to the eastern shore of Lake Aral, had its

shells of ordinary construction, elaborated by Prof. Abel
nearly three years ago, by which the breaking up of cast
iron shells into a large number of fragments and their
dispersion with considerable violence is accomplished by
filling the shell with water instead of with an explosive
agent.
In a memoir communicated by Mr. Abel to the Royal
Society in 1873,* it was pointed out that detonation was
transmitted from a mass of dry compressed gun-cotton
to distinct masses of the material saturated with water
and separated from each other and from the detonat-
ing (or "initiative ") charge by small spaces filled with
water, the whole being enclosed in a case of stout
wrought iron; and Mr. Abel stated that the sudden-
ness and completeness with which detonation was trans-
mitted through small water-spaces had suggested to him
the possibility of applying water as a vehicle for the
breaking up of cast iron shells into numerous and com-
paratively uniform fragments, through the agency of force
suddenly developed in the perfectly closed shell, com-
pletely filled with water, by the detonation of a small

quantity of gun-cotton or other similarly violent explosive
substance, immersed in the water. Mr. Abel considered
that if such a result were obtained, a shell or hollow pro-
jectile of the most simple construction could be made
readily to fulfil the functions of the comparatively com-
plicated shrapnel and segment shells which have been
specially designed to furnish a large number of dangerous
missiles when burst during their flight.
A few experiments with ordinary cast iron shells,
spherical and cylindro - conoidal, afforded conclusive
demonstration of the power possessed by water, in virtue
of its slight compressibility, to bring to bear uniformly in
all directions upon the walls of the shell, the force deve-
loped by an explosion which is made to occur suddenly
in the completely confined water-space, and showed,
moreover, that the disruptive effect was proportionate
not merely to the amount of explosive agent used,
but also to the suddenness of the concussion imparted
to the completely confined water by the explosion. In
illustration of the disruptive effect of water, the fol-
lowing results may be quoted from a number given by
Mr. Abel in his memoir. A 16-pounder (cylindro-co-
noidal) shell, filled with 16 ounces of gunpowder, was
broken by the explosion of this charge into 29 frag-
ments. The detonation of a quarter of an ounce of gun-
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
cotton confined in a shell of precisely the same construc-
tion and weight, the chamber being filled up with water
and tightly closed, burst the shell into 121 fragments,
which were violently dispersed. A corresponding charge
of gun-cotton, confined in a third similar shell, the
chamber being filled with air, did not burst the shell when
detonated; the resulting gases found vent through a minute
perforation in the plug or screw-stopper of the shell. One
ounce of gun-cotton confined in a similar shell, filled up
with water, broke it up into 300 fragments, but in addition
there were 2 lb. I oz. of the shell almost pulverised by
the force of the explosion brought to bear upon the metal
through the agency of the confined water.
The manner in which Mr. Abel has applied this system
of bursting shells is very simple. The fuse which is used in
field-artillery service for bursting shrapnel-shells or the
common shell (when the latter is filled with gunpowder and
used as a mine or an (incendiary projectile), has fitted to
it a small metal cylinder closed at one end, into which is
tightly packed from a quarter to one-half ounce of dry
compassed gun-cotton. The open end of the cylinder is

the more delicate of them disappear, in the transition from
the calcareous ooze to the ' red clay ;' and it is only by
this light of later observations that we are now aware that
this is by no means necessarily the case. On the 23rd of
March, 1875, in the Pacific, in lat. 11° 24' N., long.
143" 16' E., between the Carolines and the Ladrones, we
sounded in 4,574 fathoms. The bottom was what might
naturally have been marked on the chart 'red clay ;' it
was a fine deposit, reddish brown in colour, and it con-
tained scarcely a trace of lime. It was different, how-
ever, from the ordinary 'red clay,'—more gritty—and the
lower part of the contents of the sounding tube seemed to
have been compacted into a somewhat coherent cake, as
if already a stage towards hardening into stone. When
placed under the microscope, it was found to contain so
large a proportion of the tests of Radiolarians, that Murray
proposes for it the name ' Radiolarian ooze.' This obser-
vation led to the reconsideration of the deposits from the
deepest soundings, and Murray thinks that he has every
reason to believe (and in this I entirely agree with him)
that, shortly after the 'red clay' has assumed its most
characteristic form, by the removal of the calcareous

matter of the shells of the Foraminifera, at a depth of say
3,000 fathoms, the deposit begins gradually to alter again
by the increasing proportion of the tests of Radiolarians,
until, at such extreme depths as that of the sounding of
the 23rd of March, it hns once more assumed the cha-
racter of an almost purely organic formation, the shells
of which it is mainly composed being however in this
case siliceous, while in the former they were calcareous.
The ' Radiolarian ooze,' although consisting chiefly of the
tests of Radiolarians, contains, even in its present condi-
tion, a very considerable proportion of red clay. I
believe that the explanation of this change, which was
suggested by Murray, and was indeed almost a necessary
sequence to his investigations, is the true one. We have
every reason to believe, from a series of observations, as
yet very incomplete, which have been made with the tow-
net at different depths, that Radiolarians exist at all
depths in the water of the ocean, while Foraminifera are
confined to a comparatively superficial belt. At the sur-
face and a little below it, the tow-net yields certain
species; when sunk to greater depths, additional species
are constantly found, and, in the deposits at the bottom,
new forms occur, which are met with neither at the sur-
face nor at intermediate depths. It would seem also that
the species increase in number, and that the individuals
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
are of larger size as the depth becomes greater ; but many
more observations are required before this can be stated
with certainty. Now, if the belt of Foraminifera which,
by their decomposition, according to our view, yield the
'red clay,' be restricted and constant in thickness, and
if the Radiolaria live from the surface to the bottom, it is
clear that, if the depth be enormously increased, tbe accu-
mulation of the Kadiolarian tests must gain upon that of
the 'red clay,' and finally swamp and mask it."
Prof. Wyville Thomson further informs me that the
best efforts of the Challenger's staff have failed to dis-
cover JiathvMns in a fresh 'state, and that it is seriously
suspected that the thing to which I gave that name is
little more than sulphate of lime, precipitated in a floccu-
Icnt state from the sea-water by the strong alcohol in
which the specimens of the deep-sea soundings which I
examined were preserved.
"The strange thing is, that this inorganic precipitated
is scarcely to be distinguished from precipitated albumen,

such a cylinder can be pressed through openings of
smaller diameter, &c. It was thus shown that under a
strong pressure ice can be formed into any desired
shape, that it behaves plastically even on a small scale,
in the same way as the gigantic ice-rivers of glaciers do
on a large one, adapting themselves to the narrower or
wider parts of the valleys through which they flovv. The
phenomenon discovered by Faraday in the year 1850,
which was afterwards widely discussed, and which was
called regelation, formed the key for the explanation of
this behaviour. Not one, however, of the men of science
mentioned has tried to determine the exact pressure
under which ice changes its form; all of them have
worked with very high pressure, which in fact is neces-
sary to obtain results that are visible in a short time.
Only Moseley has made several series of experiments,
to ascertain at what pressure or draught ice tears, is
crushed, or when its plasticity becomes perceptible, i.e. at
what pressure a dislocation of the ice-particles takes
place. He found, that to tear an ice-cylinder apart,
for each square inch of its base a weight of from 70 to
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:48 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
116 lbs. was necessary according to the higher or lower
temperature (representing a pressure of Si t0 9 atmo-
spheres). To break an ice cylinder by pressure, lor8 lbs.
were necessary for each square inch ; and to cause a dis-
location of the ice-particles, from 97'89 lbs. to 118 lbs.
were required (7§ to 9 atmospheres).
Herr Pfaff, of Erlangen, has lately made a series of
experiments in order to obtain some more exact nume-
rical values for the degrees of pressure which change
the form of ice to any apparent extent; it is particularly
interesting to know with reference to the glacier motion,
what is the minimum of pressure at which ice still
remains plastic, ie. yields to pressure. It was found
that even the smallest pressure was sufficient to dis-
locate ice-particles if it acted continuously, and if the
temperature of the ice and its surroundings ivas near
the melting-point. At a pressure of two atmospheres ice
showed itself so yielding, that for instance a hollow iron
cylinder of 11*5 mm. diameter and 17 mm. thickness of
side entered 3 mm. deep into the ice within two hours,
and at a temperature of between — 1° and +o-5°. The
following will show the influence of temperature. The
same iron cylinder under the same pressure entered
1'25 mm. deep into the ice in twelve hours at a tempera-
ture of between - l° and - 40; while at a temperature
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
varying between — 6° and - 12° it only entered 1 mm.
deep in five days, at a pressure of five atmospheres, or
only o'i mm. in twelve hours. If the temperature of the
surroundings rises beyond the melting-point the ice be-
comes so soft that in one hour the same iron cylinder
under the same low pressure entered 3 cm. deep into the
ice, although it was completely surrounded by snow in
order to prevent the temperature of the cylinder itself
rising beyond 0°. In all these experiments a one-armed
lever was used to regulate the pressure; it consisted of a
steel rod of 86 cm. length, which had a boring at its
end and was fastened to a steel plug round which it
could easily be turned. By this simple contrivance any
desired pressure could be maintained for any length of
time. These and other experiments (which were made with
a pressure of only !, atmosphere) show that the plasticity
of ice at a temperature near its melting-point is very
great even at the lowest degrees of pressure. Herr Pfaff
is of opinion that at this temperature the plasticity of
the ice only becomes nil when the pressure itself is nil,
but that it decreases very quickly as the temperature gets

new forms. 3. The disappearance of the nuclei is accom-
panied by a peculiar star-shaped formation, which Aucr-
bach deduces from the flowing apart of the nucleus
matter. Biitschli has lately published new observations
on the same subject (" Siebolds und Kolliker's Zeitschrift
fiir wissenschaftliche Zoologie," 1875), from which it must
be specially pointed out that even the first nucleus of the
fertilished ovum of some Nematoidea, and of the fresh-
water mollusc, Limnaeus. results from the confluence of
several little bubbles. Hemming has found Auerbach's
observations confirmed with the fresh-water shell, Ano-
donta (" Archiv fiir mikroskopische Anatomic," band x.,
and " Sitzungsberichte der Akademie der Wissenschaften
zu Wien III. Abtheilung," 1875"); he only differs so
far from Auerbach in the interpretation of what he saw,
that he does not deduce the " carpolytical figures" of the
latter from the nucleus matter which radiates from the
centre of the nucleus, but from a peculiar structure in the
surrounding yolk-protoplasm, which he considers to be in
connection with each division of the yolk and the new
formation of the nuclei. But he does not interpret the

process of this new formation. Flemming, in his second
paper, describes the observations on a radiated arrange-
ment of the yolk, which had previously been made occa-
sionally with several other animals, without the ob-
servers being able to explain these phenomena or trying
to investigate them further. We must, however, remark
here that Goctte, in the work we mentioned in our
last report, has not only completely described the
interior process of the division of the ovum of Rep-
lilia, but has also attempted a uniform explanation of
the same. According to his experience no nuclei at
all are formed for some time in the division parts of
the yolk, but only nuclei-shaped interior transformation
products of the yolk, which are only apparently separated
from their surroundings, but are in reality in continuous
connection with them. These interior formations origi-
nate as collecting points of a radiated and universal proto-
plasm current in the yolk, which in turn results from the
reciprocal action of the ovum and the surrounding medium.
The difference in the currents is said to cause (in a
manner described in detail) the division of these in-
terior formations, and, as a consequence, the division of
the surrounding yolk material. The radiated arrange-
ment of the latter round the brighter centres is only
imperfectly visible in Batrachia; but Goette has ob-

served it in the ova of Ascidia, and interpreted it in the
way just described. The definite nuclei of embryo cells,
which result immediately from the division of the yolk,
Goette supposes to be formed within those centres from a
number of grains, which are at first greatly augmented, and
then finally unite completely. But these origins of the
nuclei do not disappear during the divisions of the yolk.
If now we compare all the observations mentioned, we
first of all find them all agreeing that l/te division of the
yolk is HO simple cell division, such as is elsewhere found in
the tissues of developed organisms; for the remainder,
the observations do not agree. While Goette supposes a
gradual and continual progress of the formation of cells
beginning from the first division, the other observers in-
cline to the belief that at each division an interruption
and a consequent re-beginning of the formation of cells
takes place, as the once formed nuclei are said to disappear
continually and new ones are said to form.

"PYTHAGOREAN Triangles " is the title of a paper which was
read by W. Alien Whitworth, M.A., before the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Liverpool in February of the present
year. A Pythagorean triangle is a right-angled triangle having
all its sides commensurable. The most familiar instance is that
triangle whose sides are in the ratio of the numbers 3, 4, 5.
The author shows that one of the sides must be even (a multiple
of 4), one a multiple of 3, and that either a side or the hypo-
tenuse must be divisible by 5. Making use of a discovery of
Fermat's, he further shows that every prime number of the
form 4 iV + I is the hypotenuse of such a triangle. The most
general results obtained are "the product of « prime hypo-
tenuses, all different, will be itself the hypotenuse of 2"-1
Pythagorean triangles;'" this result is modified if m only
are different, to 2'"-' Pythagorean triangles. With the
aid of these results he presents, in a tabulated form, 395 such
triangles, with hypotenuses less than 2,500. We may
mention that in Tebay's Mensuration a table of some 200 of
these triangles is given, but with no indication as to how they
are obtained. A great deal of information on the subject of
these triangles is given in vol. xx. of "Mathematics from the

we refer such of our readers as may be interested in the matter.

the hind limb the mere act of extension is sufficient stimulus to call
forth a definite amount of response which takes the form of a
simple contraction, but that il the limb be held until this reflex
act has passed off there is no consciousness on the part of the
brain that the limb is in an unusual position, and consequently
no volition is exerted to remove it.
It cannot be objected to this experiment that the stoppage of
the circulation in the hind limbs has diminished their irritability
because the frog A has perfect control over his ; and, moreover,
the vigour with which the reflex acts are executed in B precludes
this idea. Again, it might be said that the stoppage of the re-
spiration by the urari, and consequent supply of ill-aerated blood
to the brain has injured the volition of the animal; to meet this,

Taking as unit i vol. of carbonic acid at 6°'O5 and 22-26
atmospheres, we obtain from series A the following values lor
the coefficient of heat for different ranges of temperature :—
a = 0-005499 from 6°-o5 to 63°-79
a = or 005081 from 63°'79 to io:>°-i
From series B, with the corresponding unit volume at 6°-6a
and 31°'06 atmospheres, we find :—
a = 0-006826 from 6°-62 to 63°-83
a SB 0-005876 from 63°-83 to ioo°-64
And in like manner from series C with the unit volume at
6°-oi and 40-06 atmospheres :—
a = 0-009481 from 6°-oi to 63°-64
a = O'OO7I94 from 63°"64 to ioo°-6o
The co-efficient of carbonic acid under one atmosphere referred
to a unit volume at 6° is \
a = 0-003629
From these experiments it appears that the co-efficient of ex-
pansion increases rapidly with the pressure, Between the tem-
peratures of 6° and 64° it is once and a half as great under 22
atmospheres, and more than two and a half times as great under
40 atmospheres, as at the pressure of I atmosphere. Still more
important is the change in the value of the co-efficient at different
parts of the thermometric scale, the pressure remaining the same.
An inspection of the figures will also show that this change of
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
value at different temperatures increases with the pressure.
Another interesting question, and one of great importance in
reference to the laws of molecular action, is the relation between
the elastic forces of a gas at different temperatures while the
volume remains constant. The experiments which I have made
in this part of the inquiry are only preliminary, and were per-
formed not with pure carbonic acid, but with a mixture of about
11 volumes of carbonic acid and I volume of air. It will be
convenient, for the sake of comparison, to calculate, as is usually
done, the values of o from these experiments; but it must be
remembered that a here represents no longer a coefficient of
volume, but a coefficient of elastic force.

VI.—SIR CHARLES LYEI.L, BORN Nov. 14,
FEB. 22, 1875.
SINCE its last meeting the British Association has
lost one of its oldest members and most illustrious
presidents. There are some men the story of whose
mental development and progress in scientific research
may be taken as almost embracing the history, during
their lives, of the science to which they devoted them-
selves. Of such men we have not many brighter examples
than that of Sir Charles Lyell. For somewhere about
half a century he continued in the van of English geolo-
gists, and so identified himself with them and their pur-
suits as to be justly taken as the leader of geological
speculation in this country. The time has probably not
yet come when his true position in the roll of scientific
worthies can be definitely fixed The revolutions of
thought which have taken place within the last fifteen

years, and in which, let it never be forgotten, Lyell him-
self bore a conspicuous and indeed heroic part, have so
shaken old beliefs which once seemed securely based on
the most cautious induction from well-ascertained facts,
that even they who have most closely watched the march
of events will probably shrink most from the attempt to
estimate the full and true value of the work of his long
and honoured life. It is not, then, with any aim at such
an estimate, but rather to recall some of the leading cha-
racters of his work, that this brief in memoriam is now
written.
Perhaps the best idea of the solid services rendered by
Lyell to Geology is obtained by looking back at the con-
dition of the science when he first began to study it, and
by contrasting that state with the same subject as treated
by him in the early editions of his " Principles." To men
who had been compelled to gain their general view of
geology from such -works as Daubuisson's "Traite"," the
appearance of Lyell's volumes must have been of the
nature of a new revelation. From vague statements
about early convulsions and a former higher intensity of
all terrestrial energy,'they were led back with rare sagacity
and eloquence to the living, moving world around them,
and taught to find there in actual progress now the
analogues of all that they could discover to have been
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
effected in the geological past. The key-note which Lyell
struck at the very outset and which sounded through all
the work of his career was, that in geology we must
explain the past by the present;—that the forces now in
operation are quite powerful enough to produce changes
as stupendous as any which have taken place in former
times, provided only that they get time enough for their
task.
These views were not promulgated for the first time by
the author of the " Principles of Geology." In cruder form
they had been earnestly urged by Hutton, and eloquently
illustrated and extended by Playfair. But after much
turmoil and conflict of opinion, they had very generally
been allowed to sink out of sight. On the Continent, indeed,
they had never excited much attention, and were for the
VOL. xii.—No. 304
most part ignored as mere vague speculation. Even in
this country they had only been partially adopted even
by those who professed to belong to the Huttonian
school. So that it was in one sense as a new doctrine
that they were taken up by Lyell and enforced with a

achieved by any such energy as is still left upon the
earth. Accordingly, on the whole they were disposed to
neglect the consideration of proofs of modern changes on
the earth's surface, looking upon these as mere faded
relics of the power with which geological changes were
formerly effected. It is impossible to exaggerate the
service which Lyell did to the cause of truth by boldly
striking at the very root of this fundamental postulate
.of his contemporaries, and showing, by a wide induc-
tion of facts from all parts of the world, how really potent
were the present apparently quiet and ineffective pro-
cesses of change. With most uncompromising logic he
drove it home to the hearts and consciences even of
sturdy convulsionists, that they had all along been reason-
ing in a circle, and that the evidence on which they so
confidently relied demanded and could receive another
and very different interpretation.
It was a great matter to shake the old convulsionist
faith and bring men back to the study of the actual opera-
tions of nature at the present time. Greatly more diffi-
cult, however, was the task to build up another creed and

gain adherents to it. Yet this was accomplished by Lyell
with an abundant measure of success. He came to be
recognised as the great reformer in geology, the high
priest of the Uniformitarian school, the leader under
whom in this country the younger men eagerly ranged
themselves. Through the influence of his writings a fresh
and healthy spirit of scrutiny and observation spread
through the study of geology. And as edition after edition
of his work appeared, each more richly laden than its
predecessors with stores of facts gathered from all
branches of science in illustration of his subject, men were
led to realise how narrow had been the old conception
which limited the scope of geology merely to the study of
minerals and rocks and the elaboration of cosmological
theories. Every department of nature which could throw
light upon the terrestrial changes now in progress and
thereby elucidate the history of those which had taken
place in former times was made to yield its quota of
evidence. Hence it came about that the study of geology
received in Britain a breadth of treatment which had
never before been given to it either in this or any other
country. The main share in this reform must be assigned
to the genius and perseverance of Lyell.
But in science as in politics no reform can provide for
all the requirements of the future. In proportion to the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
zeal with which the new creed is adopted and proclaimed,
there may be and often is an inability to recognise such
measure of truth as may have underlain the older faiths,
as well as to realise the weak points in that which is set
up in their place. The essential doctrine of the Unifor-
mitarian School was in reality based on an assumption
not less than those of the older dogmas. It was an
assumption indeed which did not rest on mere crude
speculation, but on a wide range of observation and in-
duction, and it claimed to be borne out by all that was
known regarding the present economy of nature. It
professed to be in accordance with the logical method
of reasoning from the known to the unknown. Never-
theless, in the course of years the Uniformitarians
gradually lost sight of the fact that the present order
of nature on which they asserted that their system
rested could not, without a manifest and perhaps in
the end an unwarrantable assumption, be taken as
the standard whereby the order of nature in all past
geological time was to be gauged. The information

types of life among the older formations he contended
to be no evidence in favour of development. It was
simply negative evidence, and could at any moment be
destroyed by the discovery of one positive fact in the
shape of a bone, tooth, or other fragment. No one could
make better use than he of such fortunate finds as that of
Dr. Dawson among the ancient carboniferous forests of
Nova Scotia, when from the heart of a fossil tree quite a
little museum of land-snails and lizard-like forms was
obtained; or those which revealed such remarkable assem-
blages of little marsupial and other mammalian forms
from thin and local deposits like the Stonesfield slate
and Purbeck beds. But negative evidence, when multi-
plied enormously by observers all over the world without
any important contradiction, becomes too overwhelming
to be explained away. Though convinced of the un.
tenableness of the views of development which he
opposed, Sir Charles may have had his misgivings at
times that the yearly increasing and enormous body of
negative evidence in favour of the non-existence of higher

types of life in the earlier geological periods could not be
due to the mere accident of non-preservation or non-
discovery. At all events, when Mr. Darwin's views as to
the origin of species were made known, Sir Charles,
recognising in them the same basis of wide observation
and the same methods of logical analysis for which he
had himself all along contended in geology, at once
and zealously accepted them—a bold and candid act,
seeing that it involved the surrender of opinions which
he had been defending all his life. In no respect
did he show his remarkable receptive power and the
freshness with which he had preserved his faculty of
seeing the geological bearings of new truths more con-
spicuously than in the courage and skill with which he
espoused Mr. Darwin's hypothesis and proceeded at once
to link it with the general philosophy of geology.
Of his work among the Tertiary formations, with the
nomenclature by which, through that work, they are now
universally known, his observations on the rise of land
in Sweden, his researches into the structure of vol-
canic cones, and other original contributions, over and
above the solid additions to science supplied by the
numerous editions of his popular works, it is not needful to
make mention here. Enough is gained if at this time these
few lines recall some of the services to which Sir Charles

of the temple of science, and in memory of which that
name will long be remembered with gratitude and enthu-
siasm as a watchword among the students of geology.

T^HE appearance of the second supplement to Watts'

history of chemical literature which will certainly be
elcomed by all English chemists. Although it may be
said with truth that no great generalisations have been
made of late years in chemistry, the science is neverthe-
less advancing with gigantic strides so far as the accumu-
lation of facts is concerned. Perhaps no science possesses

so that not only does our modern system of chemistry
rest on a thermodynamical basis, but the future of
chemical generalisation—judging from the tendency of
recent research—lies in this direction also. The subject
of heat has received great additions; the laborious deter-
minations of the specific heats of solutions by Thomsen
furnish material for three pages. The " heat of chemical
action " has developed enormously through the labours of
Thomsen, Hautefeuille, Ditte, and Marignac. Berthelot
has also contributed largely to the subject by his thermo-
chemical researches. In industrial chemistry we find
much valuable matter added to the metallurgy of iron,

tiansen, Kundt, Soret, and Sellmeier^s researches on
anomalous dispersion, and Rammelsberg's researches on
the relations between circular polarisation and crystalline
form. The articles on the chemical action of light and
spectral analysis, contributed by Prof. Roscoe, are ex-
cellent r/fiimcs of the present state of knowledge in
these branches of chemical physics. In the latter subject
great progress has been made through the labours of
Lockyer (discovery of long and short lines in metallic
spectra), Roscoe and Schuster (new absorption spectra
of potassium and sodium), and Lockyer and Roberts (new
absorption spectra of various metals—suggestions for a
possible quantitative spectrum analysis').
Prof. G. C. Foster contributes the article on magne-
tism, and Prof. Armstrong that ,on the phenols. Most of
the articles on physiological chemistry are from the pen
of Dr. H. Newell Martin; and Mr. R. Warington fur-
nishes some valuable articles on subjects relating .to
agricultural chemistry.
The second supplement exhibits all the care and pains-
taking conscientiousness of the former volumes,'and will be
found of invaluable service both to teachers and workers.
The names of Mr. Watts and his coadjutors sufficiently
guarantee the reliability of the work; the "Dictionary"
has in fact justly taken its rank as one of the standard

works of reference in this country.
Seeing that the results of chemical research are flowing
into the scientific world in a continuous and ever in-
creasing polyglot stream, both professors and students of
the science are indebted to Mr. Watts for the laborious
task which he has accomplished for their benefit
For our own part we look with eager interest upon the
continuous encroachment of physics upon chemistry, and
venture to hope that the time may not be far distant when
generalisation may lead to natural classifications, causing
the handbooks and dictionaries of the future to be for the
same quantity of information somewhat less bulky in
volume.

map of six inches to the mile, which includes the whole
of the Bristol coal-field.
It is a pity there was not a sketch map introduced in the
guide, with just the names given of the places referred to
and an indication of the spots where the sections are
taken from. As it is, strangers to the district will expe-
rience seme difficulty in following the text, as many of
the names are not on the published maps. With regard
to the sections, too, there is no indication of the direction
in which they are taken, nor of the scale to which they
are drawn. One of the most useful features of the geolo-
gical portion is that which gives the localities where the
sections of the strata can be seen; and, as the district
within a short distance contains from the Silurian up to
the Oolites, omitting the Permian, is of interest. There
are many references to the more important papers that
have been printed, and in cases of difference of opinion the
writer has added his own views. The much vexed ques-
tion of the age of the " dolomitic," "triassic," " magne-
sian," or " reptilian" conglomerate, is duly referred to.
The notes on anthropology have reference to the tumuli
and chambered barrows, and to the present condition of
Bristolians. "A certain amount of physical degeneration
has taken place among the native Bristolians, as among

The book has one serious defect, for which the compiler
and not the authors are responsible; there is no index.

and therefore perpendicularly to their length.
Nothing could suggest to the mind more strongly the idea of
converging streams of infinitely minute particles of matter passing
through space at a distance from the earth less than that of the
moon, and at which the earth's aerial envelope may still have a
density sufficient, by its resistance, to give to cosmic dust passing
through it with planetary velocity that slight illumination which
i I possessed.
The rapid development of the luminosity of these streams on
this occasion is evidenced by the fact that thev were observed at the
lime of leaving church, namely, 8 P.M. to 8.20 P.M., by none of
the several congregations of this town and Perth, but were ob-
served by many persons from a quarter to half an hour after that
time, so far as I have yet been able to ascertain by a rather
extensive inquiry. On coming out of church I myself certainly
looked round the whole visible horizon and the higher portion of
the heavens, and I made to a companion some observations on
the clearness of the stars and oark blue colour of the sky; but
about twenty minutes after my exit from church these slreams of
light had attained their maximum of illumination.

PS.—Since writing the above, in the Supplement of the South
Australian Rtguter of Thursday, May 20, I have found the fol-
lowing paragraph :—
"A beautiful lunar rainbow was visible in the western heavens
on the evening of Sunday, the 16th inst., a few minutes after
8 o'clock. For a short time the arch was nearly perfect, but for
upwards of fifteen minutes the limbs were very bright. The
southern l'mb also appeared visible for some time after the
upper portion of the arch had faded away."
Now, allowing for the difference of local time between Fre-
mantle and Adelaide, I think it fairly assumable that this para-
graph must refer to the same phenomenon which I have attempted
to describe as above; and, if so, it clearly shows that it was not
a lunar rainbow. I can find no allusion to it in any Melbourne
paper yet received here, and which reach to the 19th inst.
There the sky may that evening have been cloudy, and lhus
have rendered it invisible. All intelligent persons here who
observed it, and with whom I have had opportunity of conversing
since the 16th inst. to this day, concur in my impression that

/'Instinct" and "Reason"
A FEW facts came under my observation during the spring of
this year that strikingly illustrate this subject. A pair of black-
birds built a nest on the top of my garden wall, which is thickly
covered with ivy and within three yards of the drawing-room
window. When the young birds were about three parts fledged
one of them by some mishap left the nest and fell into the flower
garden. My cat (seven years old, and which has killed scores o,f
small birds) immediately found it, and at the same time a kitten
(about three months old, but not belonging to the cat) began to
pay rather rude attentions to the young blackbird, and would
have used it as kittens are wont, but the old cat would not suffer
her to touch it. The cause of this was the old cock blackbird,
being aware of the peril of its young, made a great noise and kept
flying here and there around the scene of action, crying and
scolding with might and main. It then became evident to me

These are greatly at variance with the positions ob-
served, which show that the companion was then in the
following semi-circle, ar.d by the estimates of distance had
approached the primary between 1781 and 1802. Barclay's
epoch i87i'4 assigns a distance less byo''3J than was
observed at Leyton in 1866, which is confirmed by Dem-
bowski's measures about the same time. There is in the
case of this star a very unusual discordance between the dis-
tances of Struve and Dawes, which attains a maximum,
o"-45, about 1836-5; in deducing the above formula;
Struve's measures were employed. The rate of increase
in the distance has been diminishing, until by Dem-
bowski's measures, 1863-68, it was less than o"-oi
annually; the orbit is evidently inclined only a few
degrees to the line of sight, so that the companion made
a very close approach between 1802 and 1S19.—If the
angles of position, in the case of 2 i8i9between 1828 and
1870 are projected, it will appear that the velocity has
been diminishing from about 2"'i in 1840, to o0,85 at the
end of the period, which with the accompanying increase
of distance confirms Struve's judgment as to orbital

M. Leverrier's Theory and Tables of Saturn.—
We learn that M. Leverrier has completed his long-
continued and exhaustive investigations on the motion of
Saturn, and that his theory is reduced into tables, which
will of course speedily take the place of those of Bouvard,
or of provisional tables which have been used in the pre-
paration of one or two of our ephemeride*. pending the
publication of others founded upon a more complete
theory and discussion of the observations from the time
of Bradley. As in all Leverrier's previous researches of a
similar nature, he has made use of the rich store of
observations accumulated at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich during upwards of 120 years, and also of the
long series which has been formed at the Observatory of
Paris. The mathematical astronomer will await the pub-
lication of M. Leverrier's researches in detail with extreme
interest. The Tables of Saturn are understood to be
necessarily of considerable extent, with the view to their
convenient application.

probable that no parabola will be found to do so. The
following may, perhaps, be closer than any yet pub-

But this orbit exhibits differences from the observations
of a kind that should probably be attributed to deviation
from parabolic motion, and as we are in possession of
many of the original observations, it would be desirable
to discuss them with the view of determining the true
character of the orbit in which the comet was moving.
Its transit over the sun's disc, a nearly central transit,
early on the morning of June 26, and the suspicion that
it was actually observed upon the disc by Pastorff at
Buchholz, or, as is even more probable, by Stark at Augs-

only lately has attracted great attention; we therefore
can hardly be astonished that in such treatises, descrip-
tions and determinations of the different forms are in the
majority, and that the particular course of life of single
species remains at present still wrapped in considerable
darkness. These neat little organisms consist of a
very simple substance, which supports their existence
(sarcode) and of a siliceous skeleton, which in some
instances radiates outwardly in all directions, while in
others it appears as a bag- or bottle-shaped shell, and is
often adorned with relief-work well worthy of admiration.
As indications seem to become more and more nume-
rous that not only within the range of one species, but
even in the development of one and the same individual
animal, different forms occur, it is evident that the propa-
gation and development of these organisms must remain
difficult to understand, so long as thc.se relative connec-
tions are not investigated. But thus much is already-
known, that even in the most distant localities the same
forms may occur, and that the marine Radiolaria and
Rhizopoda have near relations, or even identical forms, in
fresh water. Besides division, the following phenomena
seem to be connected with propagation: the phenomenon
of conjugation (temporary union of two animals), of

was made to deal with this question, excepting the simple
expedient of placing a spherical mirror on the landward side,
where no light was wanted, and thus the rays intercepted by the
mirror were reflected back again through the flame, so as to be
ultimately ac'ed on by the apparatus at the seaward side. But
this device did not in any way fulfil the condition of allocating
the rays proportionally to the varying distances at which the
light had to be seen in the different azimuths, nor to the ampli-
tude of the arcs. What was required was a systtm by which the
whole light from the lamp shoitU hi spread horizontally and with
strict equality oi'er any given arc in azimuth; and at a light of
untqnal range, which must be te-n at different distancis in differ-
ent azimuths, the rays should be allocated to each of such arcs in
the compound ratio of the number »f Jegreei and the distancu
from which the li^ht has to pe seen in such arcs.
It is unnecessary to give a description of the various methods
of solving this problem for fixed and revolving light;, which I
have elsewhere published under the name of "Azimuthal Con-
densing Lights."1 All that is here required is to indicate gene-
rally the mode of dealirg with fixed condensing lights, which
was first employed for some narrow navigable channels on the

west coast of Scotland in 1857, and which is now adopted in
many different countries.
We shall take a case of the simplest kind in order to illustrate
the principle :—
Let a lamp be surrounded by the'fixed light apparatus of Fresne),
which allows the rays to pass through it unaltered in direction
in azimuth, so as thus to show a light of equal in'ersityall round
the horizon, but which operates on the rays in altitude by betid-
ing upwards, to the horizontal, those rays which wuld fall on
the lightroom floor and be lost, and also by bending downwards
to the horizontal those rays which would naturally pass up to the
clouds. This instrument then strengthens the light passing to
the sailor's eye, by bending upwards and downwards those rays
which would otherwise be entirely lost. Suppose, however, that
the light does not require to be seen at all in an arc in the
direction «f the land, and that there are two other sectors in azi-
muth in which the light has to be seen at greater distances than
any others. If we place outside of Fresnel's apparatus in the
azimuths towards the lard (which may therefore be made dart)
straight prisms which have each the property of spreading the
light that falls on them over the sectors that require most
strength, and if we propoition the number of these straight
prismi to the required distances and to the number of degrees
which have to be illuminated, we shall then fulfil this simplest case
of the problem, viz., the due strengthening of the light in the

directions of the longest range?, and its uniform distribution in
azimuth over those sectors.
The diagram represents in horizontal middle section the design
for a new light which is about to be erected and which requires to
illuminate different arcs with light of different intensity. A is tbe
lamp encircled in front by B, which represents part of Fresnel's
.
fixed light apparatus, outside of which are shown straight vertical
prisms numbered I to 14 for condensing the rays over the arcs in
azimuth that have to be strengthened, and which arcs have cor-
responding numbers I to 14. The novelty in this arrangement
is the mode adopted for reducing the space which would other-
wise be occupied by the condensing prisms but for which there
is no room in a lantern of ordinary size.
My friend Piof. Swan, of St. Andrew?, among other ingenious
devices in a paper read to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, pro-
posed, in order to reduce the space occupied by the apparatus', to
place prisms behind others and to project the rays from the prisms
behind, forwards through spaces left between the prisms in front.
In the present design I have availed myself of this proposal.
The prisms 10 to 14 throw their light between the prisms 3 to 8.

tickets was most satisfactorily worked off. It will be
surprising if the amount expended do not exceed

experience goes at present, that full success is likely to be
realised which is worth very much more than can be

Inaugural Address of Sir John Hawkshaw, F.R.S.,
President.
To those on whom the British Association confers the
honour of presiding over its meetings, the choice of a subject
presents some difficulty.
The Presidents of Sections, at each annual meeting, give an
account of what is new in their respective departments; and
essays on science in general, though desirable and interesting in
the earlier years of the Association, would be less appropriate
to-day.
Past Presidents have already discoursed on many subjects, on
things organic and inorganic, on the mind and on things perhaps
beyond the reich of mind, and I have arrived at the conclusion
that humbler themes will not be out of place on this occasion.
I propose in this Address to say something of a profession to
which my lifetime has been devoted—-a theme which cannot
perhaps be expected to stand as high in your estimation as in
my own, and 1 may have some difficulty in making it interesting;

Rapid as has been the growth of knowledge and skill as
applied to the art of the engineer during the last century, we
must, if we would trace its origin, seek far back among the
earliest evidences of civilisation.
In early times, when settled communities were few and isolated,
the opportunities for the interchange of knowledge were scanty
or wanting altogether. Often the slowly accumulated remits of
the experience of the wisest heads and the most skilful hands of
a community were lost on its downfall. Inventions of one period
were lost and found again. Many a patient investigator has
puzzled his brain in trying to solve a problem which had yielded
to a more fortunate labourer in the same field some centuries
before.
The ancient Egyptians had a knowledge of Metallurgy, much
of which was lost during the years of decline which followed the
golden age of their civilisation. The art of casting bronze over
iron was known to the Assyrians, though it has only lately been
introduced into modern metallurgy ; and patents were granted
in 1609 for processes connected with the manufacture of glass,
which had been practised centuries before.' An inventor in the
reign of Tiberius devised a method of producing flexible glass,
but the manufactory of the artist was totally destroyed, we are
told, in order to prevent the manufacture of copper, silver, and
gold from becoming depreciated."

takes Irom not knowing what those had done who have gone
before them, and have had the same difficulties to contend with.
In the long discussion which took place as to the practicability of
making the Suez Canal, an early objection was brought against
it that there was a difference of 32^ feet between the level of the
Red Sea and that of the Mediterranean. Laplace at once
declared that such could not be the case, for the mean level of
the sea was the same on all parts of the globe. Centuries
before the time of Laplace the same objection had been raised
against a project for joining the waters of these two seas. Accord-
ing to the old Greek and Roman historians, it was a fear of flood-
ing Egypt with the waters of the Red Sea that made Darius,
and in later times ayain Ptolemy, hesitate to open the canal
between Suez and the Nile.3 Yet this canal was made, and was
in use some centuries before the time of Darius.
Strabo4 tells us that the same objection, that theadjjining
seas were of different levels, was made by his engineers to Deme-
trius,5 who wished to cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth
some two thousand years ago. But Strabo" dismisses at once
this idea of a difference of level, agreeing with Archimedes that
the force of gravity spreads the sea equally over the earth.

The genius for dealing with large masses in building did not
pass away with the pyramid builders in Egypt, but their descen-
dants continued to gain in mechanical knowledge, judging from
the enormous blocks which they handled with precision. When
the command of human labour was unlimited, the mere trans-
port of such blocks as the statue of Rameses the Great, for
instance, which weighed over 800 tons, need not so greatly ex-
cite our wonder; and we know how such blocks were moved
from place to place, for it is shown on the wall paintings of
tombs of the period which still remain.
But as the weight of the mass to be moved is increased, it
becomes no longer a question of only providing force in the shape
of human bone and muscle. In moving in the last century the
block which now forms the base for the statue of Peter the Great,
at St. Petersburg, and which weighs 1,200 tons, force could be
applied as much as was wanted, but great difficulty was experienced
in supporting it, and the iron balls on which it was proposed to
roll the block along were crushed, and a harder metal had to be
substituted.1 To facilitate the transport of material, the Egyp-
tians made solid causeways of granite from the Nile to the
Pyramids ; and in the opinion of Herodotus, who saw them,

the causeways were more wonderful works than the Pyramids
themselves.3
The Egyptians have left no record of how they accomplished
a far more difficult operation than the mere transport of weight—
that is, how they erected obelisks weighing more than 400 tons.
Some of these obelisks must have been lifted vertically to place
them in position, as they were by P'ontana in Rome in later
times, when the knowledge of mechanics, we know, was far
advanced.3
The practice of using large blocks of stone either as monoliths
or as forming parts of structures has existed from the earliest limes
in all parts of the world.
The Peruvians used blocks weighing from 15 to 20 tons, and
fitted them with the greatest nicety in their cleverly designed
fortifications.*
In India large blocks were used in bridges when the repug-
nance of Indian builders to the use of the arch rendered them
necessary, or in temples, where, as in the Temple of the Sun at
Orissa, stones weighing from 20 to 30 tons form part of the
pyramidal roof at a height of from 70 to So feet from the ground.5
Even as late as the last century, Indians, without the aid of
machinery, were using blocks of granite above 40 feet long for
the doorposts of the gateway ol Seringham, and roofing blocks
of the same stone for a span of 21 feet.6
At Persepolis, in the striking remains of the palaces of Xerxes

and Darius, more than one traveller has noted the great size of
the stones, some of which are stated to be 55 feet long and 6 to
10 feet broad.
So in the Greek temples of Sicily, many of the blocks in the
upper parts of the temples are from 10 to 20 tons weight.
The Romans, though they did not commonly use such large
stones in their own constructions, carried off the largest obelisks
from Egypt and erected them at Rome, where more arc now
to be found than remain in Egypt. In the temples of Baalbek,
erected under Roman rule, perhaps the largest stones are to be
found which have been used for building since the time of the
Pharaohs. The terrace wall of one of the temples is composed
of three courses of stones, none of which are less than 30 feet
long; and one stone still lies in the quarry squared and ready
for transport, which is 70 feet long and 14 feet square, and
weighs upwards of 1,135 'ons> or nearly as much as one of the
tubes of the Britannia Bridge.
I have not mentioned dolmens and menhirs, rude unhewn
stones often weighing from 30 or 40 tons, which are found from
Ireland to India, and from Scandinavia to the Atlas, in Africa.

The influence of the discovery of iron on the progress of art
and science cannot be over-estimated. India well repaid any
advantage which sh^ may have derived from the early civilised
communities of the West if she were the first to supply them
with iron and steel.
An interesting social problem is afforded by a comparison of
the relative conditions of India and this country at the present
time. India, from thirty to furty centuries ago, was skilled in
the manufacture of iron and cotton goods, which manufactures,
in less than a century, have done sa much for this country. It

to the East, China had probably knowledge of the use of

of iron and coal. Baron Richthofen, who has visited and
described some of the coal-fields of China, believes that one
province alone, that of Southern Shanshi, could supply the world
.it its present rate of consumption for several thousand years.

Polo tells us that coil was universally used as fuel in the parts
of China which he visited towards the end of the fourteenth
century, and from other sources we have reason to believe it was
used there as fuel 2,000 years ago. But what progress has
China made in the last ten centuries? A great future is un-
doubtedly in store for that country; but can the race who now
dwell there develop its resources, or must they await the aid of
an Aryan race? Or is anything more necessary than a change
of institutions, which might come unexpectedly, as in Japan?
The art of extracting metals from the ore was practised at a very
early date in this country. The existence long ago of tin mines in
Cornwall, which are so often spoken of by classical writers, is
well known to all. That iron was also extracted from the ore
by the ancient Britons is most probable, as it was largely used
for many purposes by them bef jre the Roman conquest. The
Romans worked iron extensively in the Weald of Kent, as we
assume from the large heaps of slag containing Roman coins
which still remain there. The Romans always availed themselves
of the mineral wealth of the countries which they conquered,
and their mining operations were often carried out on the
largest scale, as in Spain, for instance, where as many as forty
thousand miners were regularly employed in the mines at New
Carthage.8
Coal, which was used for ordinary purposes in England as
early as the ninth century, does not appear to have been largely

used for iron smelting until the eighteenth century, though a
patent was granted for smelting iron with coal in the year
1611.8 The use of charcoal for that purpose was not given up
until the beginning of this century, since which period an
enormous increase in the mining and metallurgical industries has
taken place; the quantity of coal raised in the United Kingdom
in 1873 having amounted to 127 million tons, and the quantity
of pig iron to upwards of 64 million tons.
The early building energy of the world was chiefly spent on
the erection of tombs, temples, and palaces.
While, in Egypt, as we have seen, the art of building in stone
had 5,000 years ago reached the greatest perfection, so in Meso-
potamia the art of building with brick, the only available material
in that country, was in an equally advanced state some ten
centuries later. That buildings of such a material have lasted to
this day shows how well the work was done; their ruinous con-
dition even now is owing to their having served as quarries for
the last three or four thousand years, so that the name of
Nebuchadnezzar, apparently one of the greatest builders of
ancient times, is as common on the bricks of many modern

for navigation. Such was the canal which effected a junction
between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, which was a re-
markable work, having regard to the requirements of the age in
which it was made. Its length was about eighty miles; its
width admitted of two triremes passing one another.1 At least
one of the navigable canals of Babylonia, attributed to Nebuchad-
nezzar, can compare in ex'ent with any work of later times. I
believe Sir H. Rawlinson has traced the canal to which I allude
throughout the greater part of its course, from Hit on the
Euphrates to the Persian Gulf, a distance of between four and
five hundred miles.* It is a proof of the estimation in which
such works were held in Babylonia and Assyria, that, among
the titles of the god Vul were those of "Lord of Canals," and
"The Establisher of Irrigation Works."3
The springs of knowledge which had flowed so long in Baby-
lonia and Assyria were dried up at an early period. With the
fall of Babylon and destruction of Nineveh the settled popula-
tion of the fertile plains around them disappeared, and that
which was desert before man led the waters over it became
desert again, affording a wide field for, and one well worthy of,
the labours of engineers to come.

Such was not the case with Egypt. Long after the period of its
greatest prosperity was reached, it remained the fountain head
Irom whence knowledge flowed to Greece and Rome. The
philosophers of Greece and those who, like Archimedes, were
possessed of the best mechanical knowledge of the time, re-
paired to Egypt to study and obtain the foundation of their
knowledge from thence.
Much as Greece and Rome were indebted to Egypt, it will
probably be fomd, as the inscribed tablets met with in the
mounds of Assyria and Chaldaca are deciphered, that the later
civilisations owe, if not more, at least as much, to those countries
as to Egypt. This is the opinion of Mr. Smith, who, in his work
describing his recent interesting discoveries in the East, says that
the classical nations "b-jrrowed fir more from the valley of the
Euphrates than that of the Nile." *
In the science of astronomy, which in these days is making
such marvellous discoveries, Chaldnea was undoubtedly pre-
eminent. Among the miny relics of these ancient peoples
which Mr. Smith has recently brought to this country is a
portion of a metal astrolabe from the palace of Sennacherib, and
a tablet on which is recorded the division of the heavens accord-
ing to the four seasons, and the rule for regulating the inter,
calary month of the year. Not only did the Chaldoeans map
out the heavens and arrange the stars, but they traced the motion
of the planets, and observed the appearance of comets; they

fixed the signs of the zodiac, and they studied the sun and moon
and the periods of eclipses.11
But to return to that branch of knowledge to which I wish
more particularly to draw your attention, as it grew and spread
from eait to west, from Asia over Europe. Of all nations of
Europe the Greeks were most intimately connected with the
civilisation of the East. A maritime people by the nature of the
land they lived in, colonisation followed as a matter of course on
the tracks of their trading vessels; and thus, more than any
other people, they helped to spread Eastern knowledge along
the shores of the Mediterranean, and throughout the south of
Europe.
The early constructive works of Greece, till about the seventh
century B.C., form a strong contrast to those of its more pros-
perous days. Commonly called Pelasgian, they are more remark-
able as engineering works than admirable as those which fol-
lowed them were for architectural beauty. Walls of huge
unshapely stones—admirably fitted together, however—tunnels,
and bridges, characterise this period. In Greece, during the
few and glorious centuries which followed, the one aim in all
construction was to please the eye, to gratify the sense of beauty;

later years the supply was increased by the construction of five
more aqueducts. Three of the old aqueducts have sufficed to
supply the wants of the city in modern times. These aqueducts
of Rome are to be numbered among her grandest engineering
works.1 Time will not admit of my saying anything about her
harbour works and bridges, her basilicas and baths, and nume-
rous other works in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa. Not only
were these works executed in a substantial and perfect manner,
but they were maintained by an efficient staff of men divided
into bodies, each having their special duties to perform. The
highest officers of state superintended the construction of works,
were proud to have their names associated with them, and con-
structed extensive works at their own expense.
Progress in Europe stopped with the fall of the Roman
Empire. In the fourth and succeeding centuries the barbarian
hordes of Western Asia, people who felt no want of roads and
bridges, swept over Europe to plunder and destroy.
With the seventh century began the rise of the Mohammedan
power, and a partial return to conditions apparently more favour-
able to the progress of industrial art, when widespread lands
were again united under the sway of powerful rulers.2 Science

owes much to Arab scholars, who kept and handed on to us the
knowledge acquired so slowly in ancient times, and much of
which would have been lost but for them. Still, few useful
works remain to mark the supremacy of the Mohammedan
power at all comparable to those of the age which preceded its
rise.
A great building age began in Europe in the tenth century,
and lasted through ihe thirteenth. It was during this period that
these great ecclesiastical buildings were erected, which are not
more remarkable for artistic excellence than for boldness in
design.
While the building of cathedrals progressed on all sides in
Europe, works of a utilitarian character, which concern the
engineer, did not receive such encouragement, excepting perhaps
in Italy.
From the twelfth to the thirteenth centuries, with the revival
of the arts and sciences in the Italian republics, many im-
portant works were undertaken for the improvement of the
rivers and harbours of Italy. In 1481 canal locks were first used;
and some of the earliest of which we have record were erected
by Leonardo da Vinci, who would be remembered as a skilful
engineer had he not left other greater and more attractive works
to claim the homage of posterity.
The great use that has since been made of this simple means
of transferring floating vessels from one water level to another,

in connection not only with inland navigation, but in all the
great ports and harbours of the world, renders it all themore
deserving of remark.
In India, under the Moguls, irrigation works, for which they
had a natural aptitude, were carried on during these centuries
with vigour, and more than one emperor is noted for the nume-
rous great works of this nature which he carried out. If the native
records can be trusted, the number of hydraulic works undertaken
by some rulers is surprising. Tradition relates that one king
who reigned in Orissa in the twelfth century made one million
tanks or reservoirs, besides building sixty temples, and erecting
numerous other works.3 3
In India, the frequent overflow of the great rivers, and the
periodical droughts, which rendered irrigation necessary, led to
extensive protective works being undertaken at an early period;
but as these works have been maintained by successive rulers,
Mogul and Mohammedan, until recent times, and have not been
left lor our inspection, deserted and useless for 3,000 years or
more, as is olten the case in Egypt and Mesopotamia, there is
more difficulty in ascertaining the date of such works in India.

new faculty, but it at once set his other faculties on an eminence,

Water-mills, wind-mills, and horse-machines were in most
cases superseded. Deep mines, before only accessible by adits
and water levels, could at once be reached with ease and eco-
nomy. Lakes and fens which, but for the steam-engine, would
have been left untouched, were drained and cultivated.
The slow and laborious toil of hands and fingers, bone and
sinew, was turned to other employments, where, aided by in-
genious mechanical contrivances, the produce of one pair of
hands was multiplied a thousand-fold, and their cunning ex-
tended until results marvellous, if you consider them, were
attained. Since the time of Watt the steam-engine has exerted
a power, made conquests, and increased and multiplied the
material interests of this globe to an extent which it is
scarcely possible to realise.
But while Watt has gained a world-wide, well-earned fame,

worked silently at home, in the mill, or in the factory, observed
by few. Indeed, in most cases these silent workers had no
wish to expose their work to public gaze. Were it not so, the
factory and the mill are not places where people go to tc.ke the
air. How long in the silent night the inventors of these machines
sat and pondered; how often they had to cast aside some long-
sought mechanical movement and seek another and a better
arrangement of parts, none but themselves could ever know.
They were unseen workers, who succeeded by rare genius, long
patience, and indomitable perseverance.
More ingenuity and creative mechanical genius is perhaps dis-
played in machines used for the manufacture of textile fabrics
than by those used in any other industry. It was not until la*e
in historical times that the manufacture of such fabrics became
established on a large scale in Europe. Although in China man
was clothed in silk long ago, and although Confucius, in a work
written 2,300 years ago, orders with the greatest minuteness
the rules to be observed in the production and manufacture cf
silk, yet it was worth nearly its weight in gold in Europe in the
time of Aurelian, whose empress had to forego the luxury of a
silk gown on account of its cost?' Through Constantinople and
Italy the manufacture passed slowly westwards, and was not
established in France until the sixteenth century, and arrived at
a still later period in this country. It is related that James V.
had to borrow a pair of silk hose from the Earl of Mar, in order

that he might not, as he expressed it, appear as a scrub before
strangers.
So cotton, of which the manufacture in India dates from be-
fore historical times, had scarcely by the Christian era reached
Persia and Egypt. Spain in the tenth and Italy in the four-
teenth century manufactured it, but Manchester, which is now
the great metropolis of the trade, not until the latter half of the
seventeenth century.
Linen was worn by the old Egyptians, and some of their linen
mummy cloths surpass in fineness any linen fabrics made in later
days.2 The Babylonians wore linen also and wool, and obtained
a widespread fame for skill in workmanship and beauty in
design.
In this country wool once formed the staple for clothing. Silk
was the first rival, but its costliness placed it beyond the reach
of the many. To introduce a new material or improved machine
into this or other countries a century or more ago was no light
undertaking. Inventors, and would-be benefactors alike, ran
the risk of loss of life. Loud was the outcry made in the early
part of the eighteenth century against the introduction of Indian
cottons and Dutch calicoes.

A triumph of engineering skill in ship-building, the Great

attempt in this direction has lately been made by Mr. Bessemer;
whether a successful one yet remains to be proved. In any event,
he and those who have acted with him deserve our praise for an
experiment which must add to our knowledge.
It is a question of vital importance to the steamboat that the
consumption of fuel should be reduced to the smallest possible
amount, inasmuch as each ton of fuel excludes a ton of cargo.
As improvements in the form of the hu!l are effected, less
power — that is, less fuel — will be required to propel the vessel
through the water for a given distance. Great as have been the
improvements effected in marine engines to this end, much still
remains to be done. Wolfs compound engine, so lorg over-
looked, is, with some improvements, being at last applied.
Whereas the consumption of fuel in such vessels as the Himalaya
used to be from 5 to 61bs. of fuel per effective horse power, it has
been reduced, by working steam more expansively in vessels of a
later date, to 2 Ibs. Yet, comparing this with the total amount
of energy of 2 Ibs. of coal, it will be found that not a tenth part
of the power is obtained which that amount of coal would theo-
retically call into action.1

except to a few, that gentleman received a reply from Mr. Barrow,

that no other than the one then in use would be adopted ;" the
one then in use being the old semaphore, which, crowning the
tops of hills between London and Portsmouth, seemed per-
fection to the Admiralty of that day.
I am acquainted with some who, when the first Transatlantic
cable was proposed, contributed towards that undertaking with
the consciousness that it was only an experiment, and that sub-
scribing to it was much the same thing as throwing their money
into the sea. Much of this cable was lost in the first attempt to
lay it; but its promoters, nothing daunted, made goo miles more
cable, and finally laid it successfully in the following year, 1858.
The telegraphic system of the world comprises almost a com-

How resolute and courageous those who engaged in subma-

centage of failure, in the opinion of Dr. C. W. Siemens (to whom
I am much indebted for information on this subject), was partly
due to the late introduction of testing a cable under water before
it is laid, and to the use of too light iron sheathing.
Of immense importance in connection witli the subsequent
extension of submarine cables have been the discoveries of Ohm
and Sir William Thomson, and the knowledge obtained that the
resistance in wire of homogeneous metal is directly proportional
to the length, so that the place of a fault in a cable of many
thousand miles in length can be ascertained with so much pie-
cision as to enable you to go at once to repair it, although the
damaged cable may lie in some thousands of fathoms of water.
Of railways the progress has been enormous, but I do not know
that in a scientific point of view a railway is so marvellous in its
character as the electric telegraph. The results, however, of the
construction and use of railways are more extensive and wide-
spread, and their utility and convenience brought home to a
larger portion of mankind. It has come to pass, therefore, that
the name of George Stephenson has been placed second only
to that of James Watt; and as men are and will be estimated by
the advantages which their labours confer on mankind, he will
remain in that niche, unless indeed some greater luminary should
arise to outshine him. The merit of George Stephenson con-
sisted, among other things, in this, that he saw more clearly than
any other engineer of his time the sort of thing that the world

wanted, and that he persevered in despite of learned objectors
with the firm conviction that he was right and they were wrong,
and that there was within himself the power to demonstrate the
accuracy of his convictions.
Railways are a subject on which I may (I hope without tiring
you) speak somewhat more at ltngth. The Brit sh Association
is peripatetic, and without railways its meetings, if held at all,
would, I fear, be greatly reduced in numbers. Moreover, you
have all an interest in them : you all demand to be carried safely,
and you insist on being carried fast. Besides, everybody under-
stands, or thinks he understands, a railway, and ihereforeT shall
be speaking on a subject common to all of us, and shall possibly
only put before you ideas which others as well as [myself have
already entertained.
We who live in these days of roads and railways, and can
move with a fair degree of comfort, speed, and safety, almost
where we will, can scarcely realise the state of England two
centuries ago, when the years of opposition which preceded the
era of coaches began ; when, as in 1662, there were but six stages
in all England, and John Crossdell, of the Charterhouse, thought
there were six too many ; when Sir Henry Herbert, a member

events, it is well that the elements on which it depends should
be clearly understood. It will be thought that longer experi-
ence in the management of railways should go to ensure greater
safety, but there are other elements of the question which go to
counteract this in some degree.
The safety of railway travelling depends on the perfection of
the machine in all its parts, including the whole railway, with its
movable plant, in that term ; it depends also on the nature and
quantity of traffic, and lastly, on human care and attention.
With regard to what is human, it may be said that so many
of these accidents as arise from the fallibility of men will never
be eliminated until the race be improved.
The liability to accident will also increase with the speed, and
might be reduced by slackening that speed. It increases with the
extent and variety of the traffic on the same line. The public, I
fear, will rather run the risk than consent to be carried at a
slower rate. The increase in extent and variety of traffic is not
likely to receive any diminution ; on the contrary, it is certain to
augment.
I should be sorry to say that human care may not do some-
thing, and I am not among those who object to appeals through

the press, and otherwise, to railway companies, though some-
times perhaps they may appear in an unreasonable form. I see
no harm in men being urged in every way to do their utmost in
a matter so vital to many.
A question may arise whether, if the railways were ,in the
hands of the Government, they could not be worked with greater
safety. Government would not ray their officers better, or per-
haps so well, as the companies do, and it is doubtful whether
they would succeed in attracting to the service abler men. They
might do the work with a smaller number of chief officers, for
much of the time of the companies' managers is occupied in
internecine disputes. They might handle the traffic more
despotically, diminishing the number of trains, or the accommo-
dation afforded by them, or in other ways, to ensure more safety;
but would the public bear any curtailment of convenience?
One thing they could, and perhaps would do. In cases where
the traffic is varied, and could more safely be conducted with the
aid of relief lines, which hold out no sufficient inducement to the
companies to make, the Government, being content with a lower
r.Ue of interest, might undertake to make them, though then
comes the question whether, when the whole of this vast machine
came to depend for supplies on annual votes of Parliament,
money would be forthcoming in greater abundance than it is
under the present system.
Hut the consideration of this subject involves other and more

difficult questions.
Where are the| labours of Government to 'stop? The cares of
State which cannot be avoided are already heavy and will grow
heavier every year. Dockyard establishments are trifling to what
the railway establishments, which already employ 250,000 men,
would be. The assumption of all the railways would bring
Government into conflict with every passenger, every trader, and
every manufacturer. With the railway companies there would
be no difficulty; they would sell their undertakings to anyone,
provided the price was ample.
Looking at the vast growth of railway traffic, one measure
occurs to me asj conducive to the safety of railway passengers,
and likely to be dtroanded some day; it is to construct between
important places railways which should carry passengers only or
coals only, or be set apart for some special separation of traffic;
though there will be some difficulty in accomplishing this.
Landowners, through whose properties such lines would pass,
would probably wish to use such lines for general purposes.
Nevertheless, it may have to be tried some day.
It would be instructive, were it practicable, to compare the

Mr. Bramwell, when presiding over the Mechanical Section at
Brighton, drew attention to the waste of fuel.
Dr. Siemens, in an able lecture he delivered by request of the
Association to the operative classes at the meeting at Bradford,
pointed out the waste of fuel in special branches of the iron trade,
to which he has devoted so much attention.
He showed on that occasion that, in the ordinary re-heating
furnace, the coal consumed did not produce the twentieth part
of its theoretical effect, and in melting steel in pots in the
ordinary way not more than one-seventieth part; in melting one
ton of steel in pots about 2} tons of coke being consumed. Dr.
Siemens further stated that, in his regenerative gas furnace, one
ton of steel was melted with 12 cwt. of small coal.
Mr. Lowthian Bell, who combines chemical knowledge with
the practical experience of an ironmaster, in his Presidential
address to the members of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1873,
stated that, with the perfect mode of withdrawing and utilising
the gases and the improvement in the furnaces adopted in the
Cleveland district, the present make of pig-iron in Cleveland is
produced with 34 million tons of coal less than would have been
needed fifteen years ago; this being equivalent to a saving of 45

per cert, of the quantity formerly used. He shows by figures,
with which he has favoured me, ili.it the calorific power of the
waste gases from the furnaces is sufficient for raising air the
steam and heating all the air the furnaces require.
It has already been stated that by working steam more expan-
sively, either in double or single engines, the consumption of
fuel in improved modern engines compared with the older forms
may be reduced to one-third.
All these reductions still fall far short of the theoretical effect
of fuel which may be never reached. Mr. Ix>wthian Bell's
figures go to show that in the interior of the blast furnace, as
improved in Cleveland, there is not much more to be done in
reducing the consumption of fuel ; but much has already been
done, and could the reductions now attainable, and all the infor-
mation already acquired be universally applied, the saving in
fuel would be enormous.
How many open blast furnaces still belch forth flame and gas
and smoke as uselessly, and with nearly as much mischief to the
surrounding neighbourhood, as the fires of Etna or Vesuvius?
llow many of tlie older and more extravagant forms of steam-
engine still exist?
What is to be done with the intractable householder, with the

with a much smaller consumption of coal?
If I have pointed out that we do not avail ourselves of more
than a fractional part of the useful effects of fuel, it is not that I
expect we shall all at one* mend our ways in this respect
Many cases of waste aiise from the existence of old and obso-
lete machines, of bad forms of furnaces, of wasteful grates, exist-
ing in most dwelling-houses; and these are not to be remedied
at once, for not everyone can afford, however desirable it might
be, to cast away the old and adopt the new.
In looking uneasily to the future supply and cost of fuel, it is,
however, something 10 know what may be done even with the
application of our present knowledge; and could we apply it
universally to-day, all that is necessary 'or trade and comfort
could probably be as well provided for by one-half the present
consumption of fuel; and it behoves those who are beginning to
build new mills, new furnaces, new steamboats, or ne«r houses,
to act as though the price of coal which obtained two yars ago
had been the normal and not the abnormal price.

travelled backwards far enough. I have dealt to some extent
with the present.

Some things have been better done than in those earlier times,

ancients. Poets and painters and sculptors were as great in
former times as now ; so, probably, were the mathematicians.
In what depends on the accumulation of experience, we ought
to excel our forerunners. Engineering depends largely on expe-
rience ; nevertheless, in future limes, whenever difficulties fhall
arise or works have to be accomplished for which there is no
precedent, he who has to perform the duty may step forth from
any of the walks of life, as engineers have not unfrequently
hitherto done.
The marvellous progress of the last two generations should
make everyone cautious of predicting the future. Of engineering
works, however, it may be said that their practicability or im-
practicability is often determined by other elements than the
inherent difficulty in the works themselves. Greater works than
any yet achieved remain to be accomplished—not perhaps yet
awhile. Society may not yet require them ; the world could not
at present afford to pay for them.
The progress of engineering works, if we consider it, and the
expenditure upon them, has already in our time been prodigious.
One hundred and sixty thousand miles of railway alone, put into
figures at 20,000/. a mile, amounts to 3,200 million pounds
sterling ; add 400,000 miles of telegraph at lool. a mile, and
"100 millions more for sea canals, docks, harbours, water and
sanitary works constructed in the same period, and we get the

works. •
The wealth of nations may be impaired by expenditure on
luxuries and war; it cannot be diminished by expenditure on
works like these.
As to the future, we know we cannot create a force; we can,
and no doubt shall, greatly improve the application of those
with which we are acquainted. What are called inventions can
do no more than this, yet how much every day is being done by
new machines and instruments.
The telescope extended our vision to distant worlds. The
spectroscope Las far outstripped that instrument, by extending
our powers of analysis to regions as remote.

Need we try to extend our vision into futurity farther? Our

likewise led to'associate the low .temperature of the bottom of
sun-spots with the downward carriage of colder matter from the
atmosphere of the sun, while-ithe upward rush of heated matter
was supposed to account f ir the faculre or bright patches which
almos'. invariably accompany spots. In the next place the Kew
observers, making use no t only of the Kew series but of those of
Schwabe and Carrington, which were generously placed at their
disposal, have discovered traces of the influence of the nearer
planets upon the behaviour of sun-spot;. This influence appears
to be of such a nature that spa's attain their maximum size when
carried by rotation into positions as far as possible remote from
the influencing planet—that is to say into positions where the
body of the sun is between them and the planet. There is also
evidence of an excess of solar action when two influential planets
come near together. But although considerable light has thus
b-en thrown on the periodicity of sun-ssoU, it ought to be borne
in mind that the cause of the remarkable period of eleven years
and a quarter, originally discovered by Schwabe, has not yet been
properly explained. The Kew observers have likewise dis-
covered traces of a peculiar oscillation of spots between the two
hemispheres of the sun, and finally their researches will place at

the command of the observers the data for ascertaining whether
centres of greater and lesser solar activity are connected with
certain heliocentric positions.
While the sun's surface was thud being examined both tele-
scopically and photographically, the spectroscope came to be
employed as an instrument ol research. It had already been
surmised by Prof. Stokes, that the vapour of sodium at a com-
paratively low temperature forms one of the constituents of the
solar atmosphere, inasmuch as the dark line D in the spectrum
of the sun coincides in position with the bright line given out by
incandescent sodium vapour.
This method of research was greatly extended by Kirchhoff,
who soon found that many of the dark lines in the solar spec-
trum were coincident with the bright lines of sundry incandescent
metallic vapours, and a good beginning was thus made towards
ascertaining the chemical constitution of the sun.
The new method soon brought forth further fruit when applied
in the hands of Huggins, Miller, Secchi, and others, to the more
distant heavenly bodies. It was speedily found that the fixed
stars had constitutions very similar to that of the sun. But a
peculiar and unexpected success was attained when some of the
nebula; were examined spectroscopically. To-day it seems (so
rapidly has knowledge progressed) very much like recalling an old
superstition to remind you that until the advent of the spectro-
scope the irresolvable nebulae were considered to be gigantic and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
remote clusters of stars, the individu.il members of which were
too distant to be separated from each other even with a telescope
like that of Lord Rosse. But Mr. Huggins, by means of the
spectroscope, soon found that this was not the case, and that
most of the nebulre which had defied the telescope gave indica-
tions of incandescent hydrogen gas. It was also found by this
observer that the proper motions of some of the fixed stars in a
direction to or from the earth might be detected by means of the
displacement of their spectral lines, a method of research which
was first enunciated by Fizeau. Hitherto in such applications
of the spectroscope, the body to be examined was viewed as a
whole.i It had nul yet been attempted to localise the use of this
instrument so as to examine particular districts of the sun, as for
instance a sun-spot, or the red flames already proved by De la
Kue to belong to our luminary. This application was first made
by Mr. Lockyer, who in the year 1865 examined a sun-spot
spectroscopically and remarked the greater thickness of the lines
in the spectrum of the darker portion of the spot.
Dr. Frankland had previously found that thick spectral lines
correspond to great pressure, and hence the inference from the
greater thickness of lines in the umbra of a spot is that this

probably disappear on further examination. This method has
already afforded us a means of determining the relative amount
of the various metallic vapours in the sun's atmosphere. Thus,
in some instances all lines are reversed, whereas in others the
reversal extends only to a few of the longer lines.
Several new metals have thus been added to the list of those
previously detected in the solar atmosphere, and it is DOW certain
that the vapours of hydrogen, potassium, sodium, rubidium,
barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, iron, man-
ganese, chromium, cobalt, nickel, titani'.'m, lead, copper, cad-
mium, zinc, uranium, cerium, vanadium, and palladium occur in
our luminary.
I have spoken hitherto only of telescopic spectroscopy; but
photography his been found capable of performing the same
good service towards the compound instrument consisting of the
telescope and its attached spectroscope, which it had previously
been known to perform towards the telescope alone. It is of no
less importance to secure a permanent record of spectral pecu-
liarities than it is to secure a permanent record of telescopic
appearances. This application of photography to spectrum
observations was first commenced on a sufficient scale by Mr.
Rutherford, of New York, and already promises to be one of

the most valuable aids in solar inquiry.
In connection with the spectroscope I ought here to mention
the names of Respighi, and Secchi, who have done much in the
examination of the solar surface from day to day. It is of great
importance to the advancement of our knowledge, that two such
competent observers are stationed in a country where the climate
is so favourable to continued observation.
The examination of the sun's surface by the spectroscope sug-
gests many interesting questions connected with other branches
of science. One of these has already been alluded to. I may
mention two others put by Mr. Lockyer, premising, however,
that at present we are hardly in a position to reply to them.
It has been asked whether the very high temperatures of the
sun and of some of the stars may not be sufficient to produce the
disassociation of those molecular structures which cannot be
disassociated by any terrestrial means ; in oiher words, the ques-
tion has been raised, whether our so-called elements are really
elementary bodies.
A third question is of geological interest. It has been asked
whether a siudy of the solar atmosphere may not throw some
light upon the peculiar constitution of the upper strata of the
earth's surface, which are known to be of less density than the
average interior of our planet.
If we have learned to be independent of total eclipses as far
as the lower portions of the solar atmosphere are concerned, it

must be confessed that as yet the upper portions—the outworks
of the sun—can only be successfully approached on these rare
and precious occasions. Thanks to the various Government
expeditions despatched by Great Britain, by the United States,
and by Several Continental nations— thanks, also, to the exer-
tions of Lord Lindsay and other astronomers—we are in the
possession of definite information regarding the solar corona.
In the first place, we are now absolutely certain that a large
j art of this appendage unmistakably belongs to our luminary,
and in the next place, we know that it consists, in part at least,
of an ignited gas giving a peculiar spectrum, which we have not
yet been able to identify with that of any known element.
The temptation is great to associate this spectrum with the
presence of something lighter than hydrogen, of the nature of
which we are )et totally ignorant.
A peculiar physical fctiucture of the corona has likewise been
suspected. On the whole, we may say that this is the least
known, whi'e it is perhaps the luost interesting, region of solar
research; most assuredly it is well worthy of timber investiga-
tion.
If we now turn our attention to matters nearer home, we find

likewise aware that these currents are caused by the unequal
temperature of the earth ; they are in truth convection-currents,
and their course is determined by the positions of the hottest and
coldest parts of the earth's surface. We may expect them,
therefore, to have a reference not so much to the geographical
equator and poles as to the hottest and coldest regions. In
fact, we know that the equatorial regions into which the trade
winds rush and from which the anti-trades take their origin, have
a certain annual oscillation depending upon the position of
the sun, or in other words upon the season of the year. We
may likewise imagine that the region into which the upper-
currents pour themselves is not the geographical pole, but the
pole of greatest cold.
In the next place we may imagine that these currents, as far as
regards a particular place, have a daily oscillation. This has, I
believe, been proved as regards the lower currents or trade-
winds which are more powerful during the day than during the
night, and we may therefore expect it to hold good with regard
to the upper-currents or anti-trades; in fact, we cannot go
wrong in supposing that they also, as regards any particular
place, exhibit a daily variation in the, intensity with which

they blow.
Again, we are aware that the earth is a magnet. Let us not
now concern ourselves about the origin of its magneiistn, but
rather let us take it as it is. We must next tear in mind that
rarefied air is a good conductor of electricity; indeed, according
to recent experiments, an extremely good conductor. The return
trades that pass above from the hotter equatorial reg'ons to the
poles of cold, consisting of moist rarefied air, are therefore to be
regarded in the light of good conductors crossing lines of mag-
netic force ; we may therefore expect them to be the vehicle of
electric currents. Such electric currents will of course react on
the magnetism of the earth. Now, since the velocity of these
upper currents has a daily variation, their influence as exhibited
at any place upon the magnetism of the earth may be expected
to have a daily variation also.
The question thus arises, Have we possibly here a cause
which may account for the well-known daily magnetic varia-
tion? Are the peculiarities of this variation such as to corre-
spond to those which might be expected to belong to such electric
currents? I think it may be said that as far as we can judge
there is a likeness of this kind between the peculiarities of these
two things, but a more prolonged scrutiny will of course be
essential before we can be absolutely certain that such currents
are fitted to produce the daily variation of the earth's mag-
netism.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Besides the daily and yearly periodic changes in these upper
convection currents we should also expect occasional and abrupt
changes forming the counterparts of those disturbances in ihe
lower strata with which we are familiar. And these may be
expected in like manner to produce non-periodic occasional dis-
turbances of the magnetism of the earth. Now it is well known
that such disturbances do occur, and further that they are most
frequent in those years when cyclones are most frequent, that is
to say in years of maximum sunspots. In one word, it appeals
to be a tenable hypothesis to attribute at least the most promi-
nent magnetic changes to atmospheric motions taking place in
the upper regions of the atmosphere where each moving stratum
of air becomes a conductor moving across lines of magnetic force;
and it was Sir Wm. Thomson, I believe, who first suggested that
the motion of conductors across the lines of the earth's magnetic
force must be taken into account in any attempted explanation
of terrestrial magnetism.
It thus seems possible that the excessive magnetic disturbances
which take place in years of maximum sunspots may not be
directly caused by any solar action, but may rather be due to the
excessive meteorological disturbances which are likewise charac-

publish their individual observations; this is done by our
Meteorological Oflice, while Dr. Bergsma, Dr. Neumayer, and
Mr. Broun are recent examples of magneticians who have
ndop'.ed this plan. The publication of the work of the latter is
due to the enlightened patronage of the Kajah of Travancore,
who has ihus placed himself in front of the princes of India and
given them an example which it is to be hoped they will follow.
But this is only one step in the i .•:!.! direction; another must
consist in subsklis ng private meteorologists and magneticians in
order to enable ihtin to obtain the aid of computers in reducing
the observations with which they have been furnished. The
man of science would thus be able to devote his knowledge,
derived from long study, to the methods by which results and
the laws regulating them are to be obtained ; he could be the
architect and builder of a scientific structure without being forced
to waste his energies on the work ol a hodman.
Another hindrance consists iii our deficient knowledge as to
what observations of value in magnetism and meteorology have

conditions uiuler which the various observations will be acces-

fiamed by a commiitce of this Association, but it is confined to
the dominions of England, and requires to be supplemented by
a list of Ihit which has heen done ubioad.
A thiid drawback is the insufficient nature of the present
facilities for the inveiitiun and improvement of instruments, :.nd
for their verification.
We have, no doubt, advanced greatly in the construction of
instruments, especially in those which are sclf-recoiding. The
names of Brooke, Robinson, Welbh, Osier, and Becklcy will
occur to us all as improvers of our instruments of observation.
Sir W. Thomson has likewise adapted his electrometer to the
wants of meteorology. Dr. Roscoe has given us a self-recording
actinomctcr, but a good instrument for observing the sun's
heat is still a desideratum. It ought likewise to be borne in
mind that the standard mercurial thermometer is by no means a
perfect instrument.
In conclusion, it cannot be doubted that a great generalisation

correlations of the then so-called Transition rocks were not un-
derstood; therefore they help us little toward a correct under-
standing of their age and character; it was not until Murchison
had succeeded in making out the true relation and character of
the upper fossiliferous beds beneath the Old Red Sandstone, and
had arranged his groups by their organic remains in consecutive
order under the name of the Silurian System, that the true age
and relation of the Transition strata of Tortworth were under-
stood. It then appeared that the Silurian rocks of Tortworth
are the southern extension of the same formations which, extend-
ing through Micklewood Chase and the Vale of Berkeley, appear
as a dome of Upper Silurian, rising near Tites Point on the left
bank of the Severn near Purton Passage. The same rocks are
found wrapping round the base of May Hill and Huntley Hill
in the Forest of Dean, in the Valley of Woolhope, Herefordshire,
on the western slopes of the Malvern Hills, and extending through
Eastnor and Ledbury to Wenlock Edge, Salop. Whatever,
therefore, is true relating to the Palaeontological character of the
Upper Silurians in these other localities, is equally correct of the
same formations that lie in the miniature basin of Tortworth.

Micklewood Chase, and on both banks of the Avon near Damory

An able paper on this subject, with Map and Sections, by my
friend Mr. Etheridge,1 F.R.S., will be found in the papers of
the Cotteswold Club.
Dolomitic Conglomerate.—Weaver described this formation as
composed principally of "rounded and angular fragments of
limestone, exceeding the size of the head, with fragments also
of quartz and hornstone. These arc all cemented together by a
calcareous paste, which is frequently of a marly nature—or of
a carbonate of lime either of an earthy or compact structure ;"
the cement is generally magnesian, and in this there are many
cavities frequently lined with crystals of calcareous spar and
quartz, and also with the sulphate of strontian.
This remarkable formation forms a kind of irregular broken
fringe, hanging on the flanks of the older rocks, and resting
unconformably upon them. We shall meet with this con-
glomerate again in connection with the beds in the Mendip Hills,
and in the Clifton section.
Ne'ji Red Sandstone.—The upper and central members of the
New Red Sandstone are found near Tortworth ; they consist
chiefly of red clay and marl.

edges of the Carboniferous Limestone.
2. MENDIP HILLS.
The Mendip Hills proper extend from Bleadon Hill near
Hutton on the west, to Elm and Whatley on the east; and they
strike nearly due west and east, and are about thirty miles in
length, with an average breadth of five to six miles. They con-
stitute the southern base of the Bristol Coal Field, or the base
of an almost equilateral triangle, formed by the Palaeozoic rocks,
comprising the area from Purton Passage and Tortworth to the
south slopes of the Mendips; this includes the outlier Bream
Down, which is only a westerly prolongation in the Severn,
separated from the main range of the Mendips by the alluvial
flat of the estuary of the Axe.
The Lithology of the Mendips consists of Old Red Sandstone,
Carboniferous Limestone, and Trias, the latter represented
chiefly by the Dolomitic Conglomerate, which lies unconform-
ably on the Old Red and Carboniferous, flanking nearly the
entire range of hills, and in places capping their summits.
Numerous islands of Carboniferous Limestone surrounded by
Triassic rocks occur east of Wells and south of Croscombe, also
encircled by fringes of Dolomitic Conglomerate, of which Church
Hill, Worminster, and Knowl-foot Hill are examples; these
outliers testify to the southern extension of the Carboniferous
Limestone beneath the New Red Sandstone and Lias south of

the Mrndips, and lend us aid in determining the probable posi-
tion of deep-seated Coal Measures similar to those at Vobster,
Coliord, Edford, Holcombe, &c., north of the Mendip range.
The lower flanks of the northern portion of the range are
covered by the New Red Sandstone, that of the south being a
mere strip traversed by the Wells and Axbridge Railway, the
peat plains and bogs of Sedgmoor covering them up to a certain
level to the east of the meridian of Glastonbury. The Lias
occupies an extensive plain, masking likewise the older rocks
beneath.
Old Ked Sandstone forms the oldest stratified rock, and is,
strictly speaking, the axis of the Mendip Hills. It is exposed
in four well-marked areas along the highest ridge :—(i) Black-
down; (2) North Hill and Pen Hill; (3) Beacon Hill; and (4)
Downhead Common, which is the largest exposed tract. The
intervening areas are occupied by a mantle of Carboniferous
Limestone, which arches over and covers the underlying Old
Red, denudation having yet spared the limestone.
The Old Red is exposed along two anticlinal axes, these being,
indeed, the chief cause of its exposure; the axes being post-
Carboniferous and pre-Triassic, are not traceable beneath or

range when at a lower level, its partial removal being conclu-
sively shown by the remnants that still cling to the steep face of
the northern and southern flanks of the Mendips.
This Conglomerate is composed entirely of greater or lesser
fragments of the older rocks composing the hills, and is the
result of the denuding action of the sea that deposited the
Keupcr beds. This marine denudation took place when the
entire area occupied by the Mendips and Coal-basin underwent
depression, the Dolomitic Conglomerate and sandstones accumu-
lating pro rata with the depression and consequent destruction of
the rocks offered for resistance. This conglomerate, the "over-
Uc" of the coal-miners of the Bristol basin, although visible only
upon the Palaeozoic rocks surrounding the coal-bearing area, is
nevertheless entirely spread over them, and beneath the New
Red Sandstone that occupy nearly the entire area from Tort-
worth to the southern flanks of the Mendips, its presence being
marked by the marls and sandstones of the Keuper, the Lias
limestones, and in other places the Oolitic rocks that lie within
the Coal-basin, especially along its south-cast border from Bath
to Wells. We have no physical evidence more convincing of
denudation, elevation, and depression over large areas of the

earth's surface than what we can witness so easdy aad study so
advantageously in the Mendip Hills; for this conglomerate rock
here defines the limits between Mesozoic and Paloeozoic times:
the highly inclined Old Red Sandstone forms the nucleus of the
chain, the Carboniferous rocks resting upon it; and the Coal
Measures in conformable succession to the latter were all in-
durated, metamorphosed, elevated, and thrown into folds long
prior to the time when, under slow depression, destruction, and
denudation, the Dolomitic Conglomerate was laid down by the
Triassic sea—the resultant of wave forces along a coast-line
which was then the Mendip range, its shingle and boulders being
slowly cemented by a magnesio-calcareous paste derived from
the wasting beds of the great limestone series. For further
details regarding the natural history of the Dolomitic Conglo-
merate I must refer to a valuable memoir on this formation by
Mr. Etheridge, F.R.S.1
The Rhccttc.—Singular beds of cherty and sandy deposits of
Rhastic age occur in several parts of the Mendips, in places brcc-
ciated, or as a conglomerate, and resting either upon the Dolo-
mitic Conglomerate or Carboniferous Limestone.
The fossils are either cherty, or they have been removed, and
their moulds are formed of chert, or cavities are left where
organisms existed.
These beds are exposed at East Harptree, Egar Hill, Ashwick,
and Shepton-Mallet. In the Vallis they repose immediately on

fill in the numerous veins, pockets, and faults in that formation,
with fossil species common to the beds.
Nowhere can the geologist read more clearly the physical
history of the groups of associated rocks composing the structure
of the Eastern Mendips than at Wells, the Vallis, Watley, Elm,
Nunny, and Holwell, where Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous
Limestone, Coal Measures, Dolomitic Conglomerate, Rhastic
beds, Lias, and Oolites are all exposed in natural sequence to
each other. There can be no doubt that the Rhaetic sea sur-
rounded and covered the Mendips; for its remains are found
reposing on the Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous Limestone.

glomerate, and Rhaetic beds, and in the Holcombe and Bar-

hope that in other parts of the country (at present believed to
be without coal, or, if present, to lie at such a depth from the
surface that it cannot be worked) it may yet be discovered at a
moderate depth.
Another feature of the Radstock Coal Measures is their great
thickness, which Mr. M'Murtrie estimates at 8,000 feet. From
this we may infer that, however limited the area in Somerset-
shire of which we have at present positive knowledge, wc are
very far indeed from the edge of that infinitely more extensive
area which the Coal Measures of the South of England originally
occupied, and within which outlying basins may still be found.
It is abundantly evident that the Bristol Coal-field was origin-
ally connected with that of the Forest of Dean and South Wales,
with which it has many characters in common, although it differs
in other respects.
In all we find the same arrangement of the different strata,
namely :—rst, an upper division of productive Coal Measures;
znd, a central mass of Pennant Sandstone; and, 3rd, beneath,
a lower division of productive Coal Measures resting upon, 4th,
the Millstone Grit. Hitherto it has been found impossible to

This great sectional thickness is attended, however, with
serious disadvantages ; for although, according to the Report of
the Royal Coal Commission, the Bristol Coal-field was estimated
to contain 6,104 millions of tons of coal, a large portion of it
lies at an unworkable depth. Another physical feature of the
district is the thinness of many of the seams from which coal is
at present obtained.
In many of the collieries seams of from 10 to 12 inches in
thickness are extensively worked, tints setting a good example
of economy of one of our most precious natural productions to
other parts of England, where veins of similar thickness are left
behind as worthless.

F/uetic.—Between the uppermost beds of the grey marls of the
Keuper and the lowest beds of the Lias there lies a remarkable
assemblage of strata, which I formerly described,1 as the
"Azncula contorta beds," from that shell forming the leading
fossil therein. The name Rhajtic has since been given to the series,
from a supposition that the beds are identical with some that
occur in the Rhx-tian Alps, which is, however, more than doubt-
ful. Typical sections of the Avicula contorta series are exposed
at Garden Cliff, Aust Cliff, Penarth, and Watchet on the Severn,
and at Weston, Keynsham, Willsbridge, and Saltford near Bath,
and Puriton, Uphill, and Wells in Somersetshire, as well as
at many other localities. Two of the most classical of the
series are Garden Cliff and Aust Cliff; the latter has been long
known to continental geologists as the Bristol Bone-bed. In the
upper part of the section are dark grey shales, intersected by
bands of limestone; Avicula contorta, Cardium, Rlurticum,
Pccten Valoniensis, Ajcimis, &c. are found in these. The Bone-
bed consists of a hard dark-grey siliceous grit full of the bones,
spines, scales, and teeth of fishes belonging to the genera Nema-

canthns, Acrodus, Satgodon, Hybodus, Ccratodus, &c. Beneath
this thin Bone-bed, with its ichthyic debris is a bed of shale
which rests upon the grey marls of the Keuper. A similar suc-
cession of strata is repeated in most of the other typical sec-
tions. I have named especially those of Garden Cliff, Penarth,
Uphill, and Watchet.
Aust has been long famous for its Ccratodus teeth, and is, I
believe, the only locality where they are collected. You will
find a fine series of them in the Bristol Museum. This wonder-
ful collection is quite unique and will well repay an attentive
examination.
The only living representative of the genus Ccratodus now
lives in the rivers of Queensland ; and a fine specimen was lately
purchased for and presented to the Museum by W. W. Stoddart,
Esq., F.G.S., for the purpose of showing the comparative size
of the recent and fossil teeth.
5. Dundry District.
The Oolitic Formations.—The Oolitic formations will long
remain classical ground to English geologists, as it was whilst
studying these rocks in Wilts and Somerset that Dr. William
Smith first acquired that knowledge which enabled him to
"identify strata by organic remains," and establish a true
natural system of stratigraphical geology.
The Oolitic period admits of a subdivision into three groups
—the Lower, Middle, and Upper ; each group is based on a
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
great argillaceous formation, on which rest minor beds of sands
and cream-coloured Oolitic and Pisolitic limestones. The
argillaceous formations form broad valleys, extending diago-
nally across England in a direction north-east by south-west.
The limestones constitute low ranges of hills, with escarpments
facing the south-west, and overlooking the valleys. The Lower
Oolites rest on the Lias, the Middle Oolites on the Oxford
Clay, and the Portland and Upper Oolites on the Kimmcridg
Clays.
The Lias Formation is well developed around Bristol; and
many interesting and instructive sections of the Lower beds may
be studied at Horfield, Keynsham, Saltford, and Weston,
whilst the Middle and Upper divisions are exposed in other
localities. It has been often repeated of late years that the
geological record is imperfect, and that many of the leaves, and
even whole chapters of the Rock-book on which the hieroglyphics
of its history were written, are wanting ; yet "Time, which an-
tiquates antiquities, and hath an art to make dust of all things,
hath yet spared these minor monuments ;" for it is certainly
true that the Jurassic formations contain a marvellously complete
record of the succession of life in time during their deposition

Justice to say that, single-handed, no such exact map for any
oni area was ever before constructed, either as regards scale or
details. This undertaking occupied its author 15 years, fills 19
separate folio maps, and is a most valuable acquisition to the

merits can only be fully appreciated by those who understand
how much patient labour, long-sustained energy, and high

the rocks in the Bristol district, I desire now to say a few woids
on a branch of the subject which falls more immediately within
the range of my own special studies—I mean the organic remains
found imbedded in these strata. The science of Palaeontology
(falaios, old ; onto, beings) forms an immense field of observa-
tion, and one that widens more and more every year. It is
impossible to enter upon any of its details now; but some of
its principles may be satisfactorily explained, and this I shall
endeavour to do.

It is now established, 1st, that the stratified rocks containing
organic remains admit of a division into four great groups,
represtnting four great periods of time:—a, the Palaeozoic or
Ancient; b, the Mesozoic or Middle; c, the Cainozoic or Ter-
tiary; and d, the Quaternary or Modem periods. 2nd. That
each period is distinguished by its own hieroglyphic characters,
which nre graven on the rocks in definite and determinable
characters. 3rd. That these hieroglyphics are the fossil remains
or imprints of animals that lived in the water in which the
sediments were formed in successive layers on the earth's crust,
and are only found in the rocks they distinguish, so that it is
possible to determine the age and position of the strata from
which they have been collected, or, in other words, identify
itrala by organic remains; and by this key we are enabled to
read the pages of the Rock-book, study the history of extinct
forms of life, and determine their distribution in time and
space.
Let us apply these principles to the subject we have in hand.
The Palaeozoic period comprises the history of the Cambro-
Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian ages; and if
we attentively examine the fossils of this period, contained in
the cases of the magnificent Geological Museum of this institu-
tion, we shall see that all the organisms belonging to one age are
entirely distinct from those belonging to the others. You will
find, for example, in the case of the Silurian age, some beautiful

corals, crinoids, and cephalopods, with a remarkable assemblage
of Crustacea, the representatives of an extinct family, the Trilo-
bitidoe, which are so highly characteristic of this age that the
rocks may be called Trilobitic.
The Devonian age succeeds the Silurian ; and among the corals
and shells so well seen in this collection, we observe a striking
resemblance to those of the Silurian on the one side and the
Carboniferous Limestone on the other; but when closely ex>
amined we find that many are generically, and all are specifically
distinct from both ; besides this we discover that a new group of
organisms of a different and higher type of structure are now
introduced for the first time, namely, those remarkable forms of
the ichthyic class the fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, and
whose singular forms with their bony armour and osseous scales
i • in mil us of the remarkable fishes Lepidostcus and Polyptcrus,
from North American, African, and Australian rivers of our
time. The hieroglyphics, therefore, engraven on the strata of
the second age are visibly different from those on the first.
The Carboniferous succeeds the Devonian; and here we find
a marvellous development of the life of this age preserved in the
cases of this institution. Pray study attentively the fine specimens

Gyrolepis, Sargodon, and Ceratodus, with bones of Plesitsaurus

that have made Aust Cliff famous ; and more than 400 different
forms have been described. Mr. C. T. Higgins made the finest
collection of these remains, which has been purchased for the
Museum, and forms one of its rarest treasures. When these
homed teeth, so called from the prominences they exhibit, were
first described by Agassiz, the living species of this genus was
not known; it is now ascertained that it lives in the Mary,
Dawson, and other rivers of Queensland, and is called by the
natives "Barramanda." The Ceratodus is very nearly allied to
the Lepidosiren, is cartilaginous, a vegetable-eater, and, like the
Lepidosiren, lives in muddy creeks; during the hot season it
buries itself in the mud, whence it is dug up by the natives, its
retreat being discovered by the air-hole through which it breathes;
its nostrils are placed in the inside of the roof of the mouth.

a remarkable contrast to them, and shows how much the life-
conditions of every age depend on the physical agents that sur-
round it. Two groups of animals appeared in great force in the
Liassic sea—Ammonites and Reptiles.
The Ammonites of the Lower Lias beds, A. angulatus, A.
Bucklandi, A. Conybeari, and others, attained a large size; and
the middle and upper divisions of the same formations were all
characterised by different species that marked horizons of life in
these divisions. Associated with the Ammonites a large as-
semblage of other Mollusca are found, as Grypluca, Lima, Uni-
cardium, Pholtidomya, Cardinia, Ilippopodium, Plcurotomaria,
and a profusion of Belemnites and large Nautili.
The Reptiles were very large, as you can see by the fine speci-
mens on the walls: Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus were the
dominant forms of this class; and Pterodactyles with expanded
wings performed the part of birds on the dry land of that era ; so
that the air, the estuary, and the ocean had each separate forms
of Reptile life in the Lias age. Another change of conditions
introduces us to new forms in the Lower Jurassic sea. A large
number of species of Conchifera and Gasteropoda crowd the
shelly beds of the Inferior Oolite; and new forms of Ammonites
appertaining to groups entirely different from those of the Lias
are found in abundance in Dundry Hill. In addition to the
Mollusca we find many beautiful forms of Echinodermata, and a

hill. Nothing gives us a clearer insight into the fact that all fossil
species had a limited life in time than the distribution of the
Echinodermata of the Jurassic strata, inasmuch as these animals
possess a skeleton of remarkable structure, on which generic and
specific characters are well preserved; they form, therefore, an
important class of the Invertebrata for the study of the life-history
of species in time and space; and this Table of the stratigraphical
distribution of the Jurassic Echinoderms which I now exhibit
reduces these observations to a practical demonstration.
The Oolitic rocks were formed in a coral sea analogous to that
which rolls ils waters in the Pacific between 30° on each side of
the equator. In the Lower Oolites are four or five Coral forma-
tions superimposed one above another, with intermediate beds of
Mollusca. The Middle Oolite is remarkable for the number and
extent of its coral reefs, and the Upper Oolite for those found in
the Portlandian series.
The Jurassic rocks were accumulated as sediments or shore-
deposits under many changes of condition; and the idea of a
slowly subsiding bed of the coralline sea gives us, perhaps, the
nearest approach to what appears to have prevailed.
The Jurassic waters were studded with coral reefs, extending

THE FRENCH ASSOCIATION FOR THE
ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.
'HIS year's session of this Association was opened last Thurs-
day at Nantes, under the presidency of M. d'Eichthal, who
is largely connected with French railways. The income of the
Association for 1874 was 37,126 francs, and its capital fund
amounts to 174,731 francs. In 1874, 5,350 francs were dis-
tributed for purposes of research, and already, owing to the
generosity of three of the foundation members, 7,000 francs
have been allotted to other purposes without trenching on the
regular resources of the Association. This year 13 foundation
members and 500 annual members have been added to the
Association.
The President in his opening address spoke of the intimate
connection between pure science and the various methods em-
filoyed to satisfy the wants of humanity. It would be almost
mpossible, he said, to enumerate all the branches of human
activity which owe their success to the researches of pure science,
—Hygiene, Medicine, Surgery, the Fine Arts, Mechanics,
Industry in all its branches, Minin?, Metallurgy, Textile

Industries, Lighting, Warming, Ventilation, Water Supply, &c.
He then referred in detail to several examples of the influence
which the results of science have had upon progress in the arts,
with the motive forces of water, air and steam, mentioning a
multitude of names of men eminent in pure science, front Pascal
and Boyle down to Faraday and Sir William Thomson, upon
the results of whose researches the great advances which have
been made in machinery of all kinds have depended. M.
d'Eichthal then spoke of electricity in connection with the
names of Oerstedt, Ampere, Faraday, Becquerel and Ruhmkorff;
passing on to speak at some length of the steam-engine in its
various forms, of the progress which by means of scientific re-
search is being made in its construction and its uses, and of
the great services which this powerful application of a scientific
discovery renders to man. M. d'Eichthal advocated the esta-
blishment of local centres of culture as the best counterpoise
to that over-centralisation to which France owes so many of its
social misfortunes. "In our time," he said, "science, history,
literature, have great wants. Libraries, lecture-halls, labora-
tories, costly materials, instruments numerous and expensive,
are indispensable to pupils for learning and to teachers for carry-
ing on their reseirches ; it is by putting, on a lar^je scale, these
resources at their disposal, that we can attract and fix in our
midst men eminent in all branches of human knowledge."

M. d'Eichthal has been very well received in Nantes, having
been greeted with a serenade on Wednesday night.
The most notable foreigner present at the meeting, Admiral
Ommaney, was elected, pro honore, 'president of the Geo-
graphical Section. The Geographical Congress of Paris has
evidently diminished the attendance at the Nantes meeting,
although M. Dumas and M. Wurtz have displayed on its behalf
a most creditable zeal. Two ladies delivered addresses, on
"Female Condition," and the "Sanitary Condition of Schools;"
rather a novelty in France, ladies very rarely appearing as lec-
turers.
The excursions, which are by far the most interesting part of
the proceedings, began on Saturday. A balloon ascent is con-
templated for to-day. The balloon will be exceptionally large,
4,000 metres, conducted by local aeronauts who have organised
an aerial sporting club.

An interesting geological discovery has been recently made
during excavations for a new tidal basin at the Surrey Commercial
Docks. On penetrating some 6ft. below the surface, the work-
men everywhere came across a subterranean forest bed, consist-
ing of peat with trunks of trees, for the most part still standing
erect. All are of the species still inhabiting Britain; the
oak, alder, and willow are apparently most absndant. The
trees are not mineralised, but retain their vegetable character,
except that they are thoroughly saturated with water. In the
peat are found large bones, which have been determined as those
of the great fo.=sil ox (Bos primigenim). Fresh-water shells are
also found. No doubt is entertained that the bed thus exposed
is a continuation of the old buried forest, of wide extent, which
has on several recent occasions been brought to the daylight on
both sides of the Thames, notably at Walthamstow in the year
1869, in excavating for the East London Waterworks; at Plum-
stead in 1862-3, in making the southern outfall sewer; and a few
weeks since at Westminster, on the site of the new Aquarium
and Winter Garden. In each instance the forest-bed is found

We have received a " Catalogue of the publication of the U.S.
Geological Survey of the Te.ritories, F. V. Hayden, Geologist

the publication extends only from 1867, they already form quite a
large library of reports, monographs, catalogues, &c, relating to
all branches of the geology, natural history, meteorology, and
other points of the extensive region which is being surveyed.
The publications of the survey, we believe, Dr. Hayden is willing
to send to any societies, libraries, or persons engaged in active
scientific investigation who may desire them; those who do
should communicate with Dr. Hayden, U.S. Geologist, Wash-
ington, D. C. (U.S.) Dr. Hayden is desirous of securing by
exchange the publications of foreign countries in geology, pale-
ontology, and natural history generally, to aid in the formation
of a library of reference for the use of the Survey, and he hopes
that all persons or societies who receive the publications of tin-
Survey will aid him in this matter.

THE SCIENCE COMMISSION REPORT ON
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE*
WE now proceed to indicate the tenor of the evidence
received by the Royal Commission on the last two
heads under which they have classified that part of their
inquiry which relates to the Advancement of Science.
III.— The Assistance which it is desirable the State should
qii'c towards that object [the promotion of Scientific
Research.]
On this head the evidence is enormously voluminous,
and it may be said to be practically unanimous in
demanding a very great increase to the aid now given
towards original scientific investigation and observation.
In order to afford some idea of the general tendency of
this mass of testimony, we cannot do better than sum-
marise the extracts appended in their Eighth and Final
Report to the recommendations of the Commission.
As to the general question, which must precede all
others, whether the State should aid science, the Com-
mission refers first, with great propriety, to the opinions
of eminent statesmen on what is as much a problem of
statecraft as a question of science.

The evidence of Lord Salisbury is emphatic :—
"Do you hold that the State may legitimately interfere
in giving aid to the advancement of science ?—I certainly
do. It is a very orthodox doctrine to hold, and one which
could be supported if necessary by quotations out of
Adam Smith, the essence of the doctrine being, that the
State is perfectly justified in stimulating that kind of
industry which will not find its reward from the preference
of individuals, but which is useful to the community at
large."
"The State has already, to a considerable extent, recog-
nised, has it not, that duty ; and there are a considerable
number of scientific institutions supported more or less
by the State ?—No doubt the State, in the money that it
gives, and has given in past times, to the best Uni-
versities, has recognised that duty."
"There are the Observatory at Greenwich, the British
Museum, and Kew Gardens ; you would consider those as
instances in which the State aids the promotion of
science ?—They would be all instances in point; and I
do not apprehend that as to the abstract doctrine itself
there has ever been any serious contest." . . .
Lord Derby's evidence in favour of State aid to science
is all the more weighty from the limitations by which he
guards it:—
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"I think there has been a very general consent
amongst a large number of men of science who have been
examined before this Commission that in the present state
of science there are many branches as to which there is
no probability of their being advanced to the degree to
which they are capable of being advanced by private
effort, and without the assistance of State funds in some
shape; what is your lordship's opinion upon that sub-
ject ?-1 am, as a general rule, very strongly in favour of
private effort, and very decidedly against the application
of State funds to any purpose that can be accomplished
without them ; but I think that if there is any exception
to that which I venture to call a sound and wholesome
rule, it is in the case of scientific research, because the
results are not immediate, they are not popular in their

other of these and existing institutions every requisite
investigation will range itself. I have not stopped to
inquire whether one or another is more or less important.
My aim in the spirit of my postulate No. 2 * has been
completeness. It may be necessary for a manufacturer to
prosecute only such particular investigations as promise
direct and speedy profit. A great nation must not act in
that commercial spirit. All the operations of nature are
so intimately interwoven, that it is impossible to say
beforehand that a given line of research, apparently unpro-
ductive, may not throw light in unsuspected directions,
and so lead to untold and undreamt-of treasures." . . .
Sir W. Thomson's evidence is as follows :—
"Are you of opinion that any national institutions sup-
ported by the Government are required for the advance-
ment of science ?—I think that there ought to be institu-
tions for pure research supported by the Government, and
not connected with the Universities. The only suitable
place at present for such institutions would be London,
or the neighbourhood of London; in that situation, I
believe, very great things could be done by institutions

for pure research, at which work of a very great imme-
diate money value would be produced at an extremely
moderate cost, and I believe that discoveries redounding
to the honour and credit and pleasure of this country
would infallibly be made."
"Are you able to give any idea as to how many such
institutions would be required?—There should be five.
One at present exists, namely, the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich. Another in my opinion is very much wanted,
an observatory for astronomical physics, then again a
physical laboratory, and a laboratory for chemical re-
search, and a physiological laboratory are necessary." . ..
"Would such a physical laboratory differ in any essen-
tial respects from a physical laboratory attached to an
University ?—Yes; it would be adapted solely for re-
search, with no provision for pupils except what may be
called apprentices, or pupils for research; no provision
for teaching the mere elements of manipulation, but pro-
vision for researches directly adapted to increase know-
ledge, and for making pattern researches for the sake of
training research pupils who had already gained experi-
ence and proved ability in institutions of instruction."
"Would you leave the researches to be carried on at
such a laboratory mainly to the discretion of the person
who had charge of it, or would you place it in any degree
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
under the control of the council of which you have been
speaking ?—I would leave it to the discretion of the person
who has charge of it." . . .
"And that the Government should also be able to
command investigation on the advice of the council ?—
Yes."
"Of course the director would report ? — Yes, the
director would report on everything, both researches
undertaken at his own instigation, and investigations
undertaken for the council or for the Government."
"And your view of what should be done in the chemi-
cal and physiological laboratories would, I presume, be
something of the same nature ?—Yes, something of the
same kiml, >//«/<?//v mutandis!'

of apparatus, it is probable, is it not, that the physical

number of such investigators, and where appropriate
rooms for carrying on these researches could be had. It
is exceedingly difficult to carry on chemical research in
one's own house, because of the want of proper con-
trivances for dealing with corrosive gases and vapours;
and hence appropriate buildings ought to be provided for
carrying on such investigations. I think, therefore, that
it would afford a great stimulus to research of this kind if
such institutions were provided, and furnished with such
instruments as would be generally useful in research,
leaving the more special instruments and materials
adapted to the particular researches themselves, to be
provided by each operator. ... I have reason to believe
that no inconsiderable number of men, more especially of
those educated in some of the science schools, would
undertake researches if such facilities were afforded
them."
"Would you consider the chief use of such institutions
as laboratories to be to enable private inquirers to carry
on their researches, or would you propose that any inves-
tigations should be carried on there on behalf of the

State ?—I think that both things might be provided for.
The State requires many important investigations to be
carried on That might well form one part of the
objects of such a building, but I should think that so far
as abstract research, of which we are more especially
speaking now, is concerned, the other portion of those
objects, namely, the encouragement of original investiga-
tion in the case of amateurs would be more important,
because the investigations made for the Government are
essentially practical investigations ; they are not usually
of that character which lead to discoveries or to the
advancement of science."
"Would you place those laboratories under a perma-
nent official ?—They must of necessity be under the direct
and constant superintendence of some one thoroughly
conversant with the operations going on in them ; and,
so far as the conducting of the separate original researches
is concerned, I think that it would be very desirable that
the admission into such institutions should be granted
through some such body as the Research Fund Com-
mittee, for instance, of the Council of the Royal Society,
or some body of that kind, who would make intelligent
and impartial inquiry into the qualifications of the men
applying for accommodation."
''You would not throw upon the director the sole
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
responsibility of deciding who should be admitted and
who should not ?— I think that would not be desirable." . . .
"And do you think it would be requisite that those
institutions should be on a large scale?—I think that
they ought to be on a fairly large scale even to begin
with, because it is always a costly process to rebuild such
institutions; and I am inclined to think that they would
be rapidly filled. A tolerably large institution of that
kind would probably in a very few years be filled with
workers." . . .
"You would not recommend, in the first instance, at
least, more than the establishment of one for each depart-
ment of science ?—I think not more than that."
•'And should it be in London?—Yes, I suppose they
must be commenced here, but eventually it would be
desirable that the important centres in the provinces
should also be furnished with such places."
"Col. Strange recommended the establishment of four
laboratories ; should you be disposed to agree with him
in that view ?—Yes, I think that those would be neces-
sary; perhaps the least essential of them would be the

364

NATURE
The great bulk of ,the evidence, in fact, on this part of
the question is to the same effect ; and it has not been
neutralised, in the judgment of the Commissioners, by other
views expressed by a small number of distinguished wit-
nesses.
Amongst the latter Dr. A. W. Williamson thinks that
the development of schools would be preferable to the
establishment of laboratories. His views however do not
seem to be fully matured ; the following extract from his
evidence showing that though more in favour than per-
haps anyone else of equal authority,-of combining school
instruction with original research, he still perceives that
some_independent provision for the latter might be desir-
able. He says :—
"At the same time it is quite possible that, in excep-
tional cases, research might with advantage be carried on
in separate places; but I should always view with regret,
as a waste of resources, the separation of that higher work
of research from the more humble work of teaching, which
naturally belongs to it. They help one another, and I
think that each would lose from being separated from the

other; still, in some cases, it might possibly be advisable."
Dr. Siemens, on the other hand, apprehends that the
establishment of Government laboratories, which, amongst
other functions, should be accessible to private workers,
might cause disappointment to some who might not be
able to gain access to them, and that there might be
favouritism and want of discrimination in the dispensing
of the privileges in question.
Dr. Burdon Sanderson would rather see increased faci-
lities given to the great schools of medicine for the pro-
secution of physiological research, than laboratories of
an independent character established. He questions
whether we have at present a sufficient number of trained
workers to use establishments of the latter kind; whilst
Lord Salisbury is doubtful whether by any moderate
expenditure of funds we could provide an expensive class
of scientific instruments of all kinds for all the persons
who might be inclined to use them.
The Commissioners, after fairly balancing the views laid
before them, sum up this question in their final conclu-
sions, as follows :—
"More complete means are urgently required for scien-
tific investigations in connection with certain Govern-
ment departments ; and physical as well as other labora-
tories and apparatus for such investigations ought to

the point, furnishing a supply of information for which
ornithologists will be duly grateful, but they are mostly of
too special a kind to give extracts from them here. We
prefer quoting what he has to say on Migration, as
being a subject in which more of our readers will take
interest :—
"Without doubt caused by the absence or abundance
of food, which in turn is caused by difference of tempera-
ture, the passage of birds in these parts begins with most
species almost to a day in spring, usually lasting for about
three weeks, tuough some, as the Hoopoe and the Swallows,
are more irregular in their first appearance ; and with
these the migration lasts throughout a longer period.
"Few (indeed hardly any birds) do not migrate or shift
their ground to some extent. I can name very few which do
not appear to move, viz., Griffon-Vulture, Imperial Eagle,
Eagle- O wl, Blue Thrush, all the Woodpeckers, Treecreeper,
Black-headed Warbler, Dartford Warbler, Crested Lark,
Chough, Raven, Magpie, Red-legged and Barbary Par-
tridges, and the Andalucian Quail. Generally speaking,
it seems to me that in the vernal migration the males are
the first to arrive, as with the Wheatears, Nightingales,
Night-herons, Bee-caters; but this is a theory which
requires more confirmation. Some species, as the Neo-
phron and most of the Raptores, pass in pairs.

"Most of the land-birds pass by day, usually crossing
the Straits in the morning. The waders are, as a rule,
not seen on passage; so it may be concluded they pass
by night, although I have occasionally observed Peewits,
Golden Plover, Terns, and Gulls passing by day.
"The autumnal or return migration is less conspicuous
than the vernal: and whether the passage is performed
by night, or whether the birds return by some other route,
or whether they pass straight on, not lingering by the way
as in spring, is an open question; but during the autumn
months passed by me at Gibraltar, I failed to notice the
passage as in spring, though more than once during the
month of August, which I spent at Gibraltar, myself and
others distinctly heard Bee-eaters passing south at night,
and so conclude other birds may do the same.
"... Both the vernal and autumnal migrations are
generally executed during an easterly wind, or Levanter;

sage, but it appears not to be the case, as, whether it be

Hofmann, of Berlin. Considering the well-deserved
international position of Dr. Hofmann, his personal
influence on the development of applied chemistry as
well as of pure science, and the excellent official English
report he wrote on the Chemical group of the London
Exhibition of 1862, no better choice could possibly have
been made. Wishing to give a more comprehensive
work even than that of 1862, and to do so within reason-

chemists of different nations have contributed articles for
this work. Some of these contributors, such as Professors
Frankland of London, and Wurtz of Paris, occupy emi-
nent scientific positions; others are eminently fitted for
the subjects they have treated by their practical pursuits.
The report is intended to come out in three parts, con-
taining the industrial applications of metalloids, of metals,
and of organic compounds respectively. The first part,
which has appeared, contains the following succession of

and subdivided by transverse constrictions at intervals of about
three inches. It was found impossible to extend it into anything
like a trunk, though it was quite soft and flexible when it arrived,
having been sent home in salt. In fact, it closely resembles the
"hood " of the Bladder-nosed Seal (Cystophora crislata), but is
smaller in proportion to the size of the animal, and different in
shape. Peron, who described it as a trunk, was so good an
observer, and generally so trustworthy, that I can hardly believe
that he invented the resemblance; indeed he called the animal
"Phoque a trompe" in consequence of its possession of it.
Might not the individuals that he described, which inhabited
Bass's Straits, have belonged to a different species? The upper
lip is about two inches high, above which the crest, or hood,
rises four inches more, and is prolonged backwards over quite
half the head, in the integuments of which it is gradually absorbed.
The animal measures fourteen feet six inches in length from tip
of nose to tip of tail, and sixteen feet three-and-a-half inches to
the extremity of the hind nippers, taking the measurements along
the curve of the back. The total length along the ground is

the diminutive hands, armed with long nails; the short, widely
spreading feet; the thick, clumsy neck, andthe huge head crowned
with its strange appendage, recall exactly the male animal depicted
in the plate of "A Sea Lion and Lioness from Juan Fernandez"
in Anson's voyage, over which it has been the fashion to make
merry for the best part of a century ; and vindicate the accuracy
of that intrepid seaman. The skeleton was in process of macera-
tion, with the exception of the head: this measured rather less
than two feet in length. The sutures are all open, and the teeth
unworn. It was impossible to examine the other bones with
any accuracy, but the epiphyses appeared to be united. Besides
the skin and skeleton of the full-grown male, there are the
following :—
Young male, eight days old, skin stuffed, skeleton complete.

Otaria of singular beauty, quite new to science, for which Prof.
Peters has proposed the name Arctophoca gaztlla, from the name
of the vessel on board of which the voyage was made. There
are also a skin and skeleton of the Leopard Seal (Sttnorhynchus
leptonyx), and many skeletons of Albatross, Penguin, Petrel, and

sent an expedition to that spot. Moreover, although these
specimens could not be better placed than as part of the exten-
sive collection now forming at Berlin, and, so long as Prof,

London, and in consequence the majority of Englishmen must

SUPPOSED FLINT SCALPING-KNIVES
IN glancing over a considerable series of American stone
implements, we quite naturally expect to find that ever-
present feature of the modern Indian's outfit, the scalping-
knife. In every collection we recognise the stone axe that
preceded the iron tomahawk ; the jasper arrow and spear
heads, now replaced by metallic ones; while neatly edged
flints of various shs.pes give us cutting implements adapted
to all ordinary uses; but not so with the scalping-knife.
However large the series, we cannot, at a glance, point
out a form of knife peculiarly well adapted for such a
purpose, from the several shapes before us. While all are
possible scalping-knives, none probably are so. This, at
least, has been my experience until very lately, although I
have constantly sought out "probable scalping-knives"
from thousands of implements gathered and being
gathered in this neighbourhood. Among the hundreds of
specimens of flint knives there occurred none that re-
sembled the modern knife, and I supposed that the itone
scalpers were similar—the later being modelled from
earlier form.
Whether the above inference is correct or not, I have
at last detected some specimens that more nearly ap-
proach the '; ideal form," one such being the flint imple-
ment here figured. The result of my collecting labours
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
during the past summer amounts to about five hundred
specimens not including fragments, and it is among these
that I found the cutting implement above mentioned,
with several others like it, both perfect and fragmentary.
As the illustration shows, better than any description can
do, this slightly curved knife seems moderately well
adapted for scalping, as described by Loskiel.* He says:
"They place their foot on the neck of the victim, seizing the
hair with the left hand, and twisting it very tight together,
in order to separate the skin from the head; then they cut
it all round with a sharp knife, and tear it off." The
specimen is a neatly chipped and evenly outlined jasper
"implement," having the edges still well defined and
sharp. The curved, and I presume cutting edge, is formed
by striking off comparatively large flakes, and is better
adapted to making a "clean" cut, than the straighter
side. The lower end, about one-fourth of the whole
length, is somewhat narrower, and while less sharp along
its edges, is thinner, and has no median ridge. This por-
tion, very possibly, was inserted into a bone handle as
modern Eskimo scrapers now are (vide "Reliquiae

feet. The body was then probably covered with bark, or
skins of animals. Of course the decomposition would
go on very rapidly, and soon no trace remain except the
bones and stone implements; then the weapons only.
My reason for believing these graves to be "surface"
burials is in consideraiion of the fact that the inhumed
weapons and discoloured dirt are only from three to six
inches beneath the sod, and this accumulation of soil is
that arising from the annual decay of the preceding sum-
mer's foliage, coupled with the dust that would naturally
gather around any object lying on the ground. The
graves such as I have described, too, are only to be found
on the slopes of grassy hill-sides that as yet have not
been disturbed by the plough. I have never seen such a
grave in a ploughed field. Such have been long ob-
literated ; and the relics now found in fields may or may
not be those that were buried with their prehistoric
owners.
In conclusion, then, seeing that the custom of scalping
was not introduced with a knowledge of metals, but pre-
ceded it, it is certain that some stone implement was
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
used; and if in a large series of cutting tools we find
some that bear resemblance to the modern form, then it
is fair to presume that these, and these principally if
not wholly, were those formerly in use.
A few words concerning this custom of scalping: is it
peculiarly North American? I should be much pleased
to learn from some correspondent of Nature what other
races, if any, have the same practice among them. Inas-
much as the Indian custom required of every warrior
incontestable proof of his success in battle or in single
combat, and considering that a warrior would frequently
attack singly some member of a hostile tribe (See Catlin's
"North American Indians"), it seems quite a natural
method of showing beyond doubt that the claimant had
indeed killed his foe. To produce any portion of
another's clothing, or his weapons, would not prove the
enemy to have been killed; to produce his scalp shows
that such was certainly the case, as the instances of sur-
vival after scalping are too few to be considered. Did
the custom originate in North America, or was it brought
from beyond our borders?

THE SLIDING SEAT FORESHADOWED
IT is a curious and suggestive fact that nearly all the

most ingenious and important mechanical inventions
find their representatives in the human frame; conse-
quently, the more we investigate the wonderful mecha-
nism of man's body, the more insight may we expect to
get into the principles necessary for the most perfect
adaptation of means to ends. Whether we take the lever,
the pulley, the inclined plane, the spiral or the curved
spring, the arch, or any other simple uncomplicated con-
trivance adapted with a view^to securing strength, or
motion, or elasticity, we find it represented in animal
mechanics, and arranged sometimes simply, sometimes
in a more complex form, in a manner and with a result
far more wonderful than ever produced from the most
ingenious conceptions, of man's brain.
Of late years the application of the sliding seat to
rowing has attracted considerable attention, and although
it is beyond the purpose of this paper to consider fully
the advantages gained by its application, it will, I think,
be necessary to make some reterence to what appear to
be its principles before we inquire whether it can be
traced as existing in certain of the joints.

NA TURE
With a sliding seat, therefore, we seem to have a pro-
vision for greater range of movement at the distal end of
the lever. In the upper extremity it seems to me we find
the same principle at work, and if so it is curious that we
should have adopted as a novelty or an invention what
nature has provided us with in other points, that we
should apply to the lower extremities in rowing the same
principle that already exists in connection with the upper,
and is brought into action perhaps especially in rowing,
and that this should have been done unknowingly.
The bony framework of the upper limb is connected
with that of the trunk at only one point, the inner or
sternal end of the collar-bone, and it is round this point
that movement occurs. The greatest freedom of motion,
however, takes place at the shoulder-joint, and as this
joint is, moreover, at the apparent junction of the free
limb with the body, the movements here are generally
looked into to the exclusion of those at the junction of
the collar-bone and breast-bone. But the importance of
the latter will at once be recognised when it is considered
that the collar-bone and shoulders rotate round the upper
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
part of the breast-bone, and according to their length and
mobility will move through a larger or smaller arc.
The amount of movement between the extremes of for-
ward and backward positions of the shoulder (Figs. I
and 2) can be readily tested, and I have found that the
average of several observations on different individuals,
taken at the tip of the shoulder, the chest being abso-
lutely fixed, is from six to seven inches; or, in other
words, the tip of the shoulder moves backwards and
forwards to that extent between the extremes of forward
and backward movement.
Similarly in the vertical line a large extent of motion
occurs, the difference between the extremes being on the
average four inches. Now, when it is noticed that the
arm moves at the shoulder-joint with an extraordinary
amount of facility, and that its chief motions as a
"mechanical appendage to the trunk occur in that articula-
tion, we are led to look upon the arm, fore-arm, and hand
as a compound lever, working with its one end free and
the other rotating in the socket of the shoulder-joint
In the lower extremity we also find the compound lever
working with one end somewhat similarly in a socket.
In the case of the upper, however, the socket is a movable
one, slipping backwards and forwards freely with the
limb and strangely increasing its range of motion; still
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
capable of being fixed firmly in position by the superficial
muscles of the back. But in the lower extremity the
socket is fixed, and there is no provision for sliding, since
strength rather than range of motion is wanted, and
where greater range of motion is needed, as in rowing,
there a blind application of the principle found in the
upper extremity has been only recently effected.
I have referred only to the sliding fulcrum at the
shoulder as seen on both sides equally, and as is best
exemplified in the position of the arms in rowing, when
however the whole trunk also moves; but it must be
borne in mind that a still further sliding of the fulcrum is
constantly taking place when one hand alone is used, for
the chest is also turned towards the object to be reached,
by rotating and flexing the spine. The advantage of the
vertical motion is seen in such actions as bell-ringing,
weight-lifting, &c. Moreover it must be noticed that
when the lever forming the arm is raised from the side to
a right|angle with the body it has reached its limit of
moiion at the shoulder-joint, and that subsequently the
upward motion occurs in the collar-bone, since the top of

Murchison's classification of Palasozoic strata, the ethno-

Channel and Severn tunnels, the coal question, and rail-
way safety, may be mentioned among the chief subjects
of wide interest. Social subjects have had a full share of
attention, considering the pre-scientific stage in which
most of them are.
Some of the personally interesting scenes have been
rather notable—as when Sir W. Thomson, in relation to
Mr. Croll's assault on Dr. Carpenter's doctrines of
oceanic circulation, pronounced that Dr. Carpenter's
demonstration was most conclusive and his reasons irre-
fragable; when Prof. Hull, criticising Prof. Hughes, said
he had never before heard so many heresies in so few
minutes; if it were possible for his hair to stand on end
it would immediately begin to friz out from the centre to
the circumference; and when Mr. John Evans, Canon
Tristram, and Canon Rawlinson combined to give a
wholesome exposition of sound doctrine in ethnological
subjects and of the relative value of various kinds of
evidence, after the reading of a paper which was destitute
of scientific principles.
Dr. Carpenter was as happy as ever in his lecture to

working men, on "A Piece of Limestone." He had a
great audience of unmistakeable working men, with whom
he placed himself in most cordial rapport.
Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., after the lecture, said the
subjects of the Association meeting were those in which
working men were deeply interested, for the competition
of manual labour must give way to the competition of
intellect. Men who wanted to get on, and masters who
wished to hold their own, must unite in promoting, by
their own investigation, the knowledge and the philosophy
which were to be found in, or connected with, their various
manufactures. Mr. Bramwell's lecture was of a useful
kind, but defended engineers and railway directors perhaps
too much.
Mr. Spottiswoode's lecture on the Colours of Polarised
Light was very successful both in exposition and in
experimental illustration. The lecturer used a splendid

Professors Roscoe, Balfour Stewart, and Thorpe, was presented
by Dr. Thorpe.—The committee have undertaken to report on
the validity of Kopp's laws concerning the specific volumes of

ment of the rate of nave progiess. His apparatus consisted of
three deep troughs, two circular and one rectangular, and the
steadiness of the motion in each was remarkable; he compared
the velocities of the waves with the times of vibrations of
pendulums, and verified that in different sized troughs the rate
varied inversely as the square root of the diameter. The
experiments excited a good deal of interest.
The Rev. S. J. Perry, of Stonyhurst College (one of
the members of the expedition to Kerguelen to observe
the Transit of Venus), read a paper on that event. Father
Ferry illustrated his remarks by diagrams of the sun and the
planet, as seen from various stations, and gave a very interesting
explanation which was attentively listened to. He said thai
although much prominence had not been given to the idea, lie
believed that a very important reason why so much expense was
gone into in the expedition was that the distance of the eartli
from the sun entered into the calculation of lunar tables. The
observations were not of any striking nature; they were simply
to watch a black spot pass across the sun. There was nothing
exciting about it, except that when the observations had to be
taken they had to be very careful about the precise time, and
they had to observe the spot during the whole time of its passage.

Having pointed out with reference to his diagrams the reason why
the different stations were chosen, he denied the assertions that
had been made that Sir George Airy neglected Ilalley's method
of observation for Delile's ; the truth was he had rightly decided
in favour of Delile, but he had not neglected Halley. With
regard to the (Hallcyan) stations in the extreme north, they were
left to the care of the Russians, and the English, French,
Americans, Germans and others occupied in the southern hemi-
sphere. As it was mid-winter, the sun was very nearly on the
line of the southern tropics and nearly vertical at ingress over the
eastern border of Australia. There were primarily five English
Government expeditions, but as these were subdivided, there
were, including private observers and those of India and the
Colonies, about twenty English stations of observation. His
station was Kerguelen, to the south-west of Australia, and after
arriving there they found that th.e Americans had taken the
station recommended by the members of the Challenger Expedi-
tion, but in spite of that they had plenty of time to look about
the island (which was a very barren place, about ninety miles
by forty-five), and they were fortunate enough to get a much
better position than the Americans, after all, by going a little to
the south-west. They had been told before they went out that
there was always a mist over the island, but, though that might be
the case in the north of the island, which had been chiefly visited
before, it did not apply to the south while they were there, and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
they had not more mist than there would have been in London.
On the morning of the transit, which they expected to begin at
6 '30, they rose at four, and at once made preparations lor the
day's work. They were divided into three parties, and were so
placed that, with the Americans, they formed four parties, about
eight miles distant from each other. They saw the sun very well
until after six o'clock, at the first (his own) station, until almost
the time that Venus was coming on to the sun's disc, and they
had the external contact as well as could be expected, for there
never could be absolute certainty with regard to such a point.
They continued very well until they had taken the bisection by
the planet of the sun's disc, but then • there was just one little
cloud that came and placed itself right over the planet and
remained till ten minutes after the commencement of the transit.
At the other stations they were able to make observations of the
ingress. At his station they were able to get observations of the
internal and external contact at egress, and a few photographs.
Father Perry added particulars of the result of observations at
the other stations as far as could be ascertained, and narrated
his experience of a cyclone in the Indian Ocean on the home-
ward passage. He added that during their stay on the island

Birmingham, the question may perhaps be considered as settled.
After some preliminary trials, a piece of glass free from stria;
was prepared of titanate of potash mixed with the ordinary
ingredients of a crown glass. As the object of the experiment
was merely to determine in the first instance whether titanic acid
did or did not confer on the glass the universal properly of
separating the colours at the blue end of the spectrum materially
more, and at the red end materially less, than corresponds to a
similar dispersive power in ordinary glasses, it was not thought
necessary to employ pure titanic acid ; and rutile fused with
carbonate of potash was used as titanate of potash. The glass
contained about seven per cent, of rutile, and as none was lost,
the percentage of titanic acid cannot have been much less. The
glass was naturally greenish from iron contained in the rutile;
but this did not affect the observations, and the quantity of iron
would be too minute sensibly to affect the irrationality.
Out of this glass two prisms were cut. One of these was
examined as to irrationality by Prof. Stokes, by his method of
compensating prisms ; the other by Mr. Hopkinson, by accurate
measures of the refractive indices for several definite points in

the spectrum. These two perfectly distinct methods led to th«
same result, viz., that the glass spaces out the more as compared
with the less refrangible part of the spectrum no more than an
ordinary glass of similar dispersive power. As in the phosphatic
series, the titanium asserts its presence by a considerable increase
of dispersive power; but, unlike what was observed in that
series, it produces no sensible effect on the irrationality. The
hopes therefore that had been entertained of its utility in silicic
glasses prepared for optical purposes appear doomed to
disappointment.
A paper was read by Mr. J. A. Fleming, On the Decom-
position of an Electrolyte by Magneto-electric Induction. When
a solid conductor is'moved in a magnetic field induced currents
are created in |it In a solid these expend themselves partly
or wholly in producing heat in the conductor. The paper was
occupied with an examination of the effect produced on electro-
lytes under the same circumstances, viz., when made to flosv
or move in a magxeuc field: experiments were described to
show first that induced currents are produced under these condi-
tions in electrolytes, and then that the electrolyte is to some
extent decomposed by these currents.
Dr. Moffat, in his paper On the apparent connection between
Sunspots, Atmospheric Ozone, Rain, and Force of Wind, stated
that in discussing ozone observations from 1850 to 1869, he had
observed that the maxima and minima of atmospheric ozone
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
occurred in cycles of years, and that he had compared the
number of new groups of sunspots in each year of these cycles
with the quantity of ozone, and the results showed that in each
cycle of maxima of ozone there is an increase in the number of
new groups of sunspots, and in each cycle of minima a
decrease. He also gave a table to show that the years of
maximum ozone and number of sunspots were generally
distinguished by an increase in the quantity of rain and the
force of the wind.
Sir W. Thomson's paper On the effectsof Stress upon the Mag-
netism of Soft Iron was a continuation of two that had been read
before the Royal Society. In the physical laboratory at Glas-
gow University he had stretched steel and soft iron wire about
twenty feet long from the roof. An electro-magnetic helix was
placed round a few inches of the wire, so that the latter could
be magnetised when an electric current was passed through the
former; the induced current thus produced in a second helix
outside the first being indicated by a reflecting galvanometer.
When steel wire was used, the magnetism diminished when
weights were attached to the wire, and increased when they
were taken off; but when specially made soft iron wire (wire

As regards the zoology of the main western portion of this
district (Tunis and Algeria) our knowledge may be now said to
be pretty far advanced. The standard work on the subject is
the "Exploration Scientifique de 1'Algerie" published by the
French Government, in which are treatises on the Mammals and
Birds of Algeiia by Loche, and on the Reptiles and Fishes by
Guichenot. This work was commenced in parts in 1840, and
the portions relating to the Mammals and Birds were, I believe,
intended to have been written by M. Vaillant, the artist of the
Commission; but only the plates were issued, and the text by
Captain Loche was not completed until 1867. A smaller and
more convenient work (or travellers is the last-named author's
catalogue of the Mammals and Birds of Algeria, published in
1858.
As regards the herpetology of Algeria, an excellent memoir
on this subject by Dr. Alexander Strauch will be found in
the fourth volume of the new memoir of the Academy of St.
Petersburg. Those who penetrate beyond the Atlas will find the

the birds of Tunis and Algeria will likewise be found in the

our knowledge is as yet by no means so perfect As regards the

great measure culled from the MSS. of the late M. Favier—
a collector long resident in Tangier." But in the south of Mo-
rocco, in the Western Atlas and surrounding district, there is
certainly a considerable terra incognita within easy reach of
England, which has hitherto been almost inaccessible to natura-
lists, though the short expedition of Dr. Hooker, Mr. Maw,
and Mr. Ball in 1871 (of which a notice only has been pub-
lished, but a complete scientific account is, I believe, in pre-
parat-on), shows that it may be penetrated if proper precautions
are taken.

NATURE
A recent summary of Italian Mammals has been given by Prof.
Cornalia in "Italia;" but on the whole it must be allowed
that a good work upon the Mammals of the Italian peninsula is
still a desideratum. Of the Mammals of Switzerland, on the
other hand, we have an excellent recent work by Dr. Fatio,
forming the first volume of his " Fauue des Vertebrees de la
Suisse," in which special attention is devoted to the difficult
groups of Rodents and Insectivores. No student of the Euro-
pean Mammal-fauna should omit to consult it.
Passing to Eastern Europe, we find pur state of exact know-
ledge as to the Mammals very defective. As regards Greece,
we may refer to the French "Expedition Scjentifique en
Mor^e," in which there is a memoir on the Mammals by
Geoffrey St. HUaire, and Erhard's "Fauna der Cycladeen,"
which gives some details on the Mammals of the Greek Archi-
pelago. Of Turkey we find very little information, and there is
certainly still mucli to be done as regards the smaller Mammals
of this part of Europe. In Russia we have Meni-tries's "Cata-
logue of the Animals of the Caucasus," and P. Demidoff's
"Voyage dans la Russie Meridionale," and perhaps other
works in the language of the country, which I am not acquain-

ted with. But there can be no doubt that it is in South-eastern
Europe that our knowledge of the Mammal-fauna of this
continent is exceedingly defective, and that much remains to be
done in order to complete our acquaintance with this branch of
European Zoology.
In Northern Europe, which we now turn to, the case is quite
different. The highly cultivated and laborious naturalists of
Scandinavia have for many years paid great attention to this as
to every other part of their fauna. The first volume of
Nilsson's "Scandinavian Fauna," published at Lund in 1874,
has long been a standard book of reference on this branch
of zoology. Much, however, has been done since that period;
and in Prof. LUljeborg's lately issued work on the Mammals of
Sweden and Norway, we have an exhaustive account of the
present state of our knowledge of this subject.
As regards the few Mammals of Spitzbergen, reference should
be made to the second volume of Heuglin's "Reisen nach
dem Nordpolarmeer," where that energetic naturalist has put
together an account of the nineteen species of Mammals that
penetrate so far north.
B. Birds of Europe.
(a.) Europe generally.—There can be no question, I suppose,
that the attractive class of Birds has received much more at-
tention than its sister-classes of Vertebrates in Europe as
generally elsewhere. Of late years especially a considerable
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
number of naturalists in almost every part of this continent have
devoted their principal attention to ornithology. Two journals
are devoted solely to this science—in which the larger number
of articles treat of the birds of some portion or other of Europe.
The mass of literature on the subject is large, and I must there-
fore be rather concise in my notices of the principal modern
authorities that should be referred to by an inquirer on the sub-
ject of European Ornithology.
First, as to the avifauna of the whole continent, Temminck's
"Manual"—long the acknowledged authority on this subject—
was superseded in 1849 by the issue of Degland's " Ornithologie
Europeenne." The new edition of this work, issued by the author
and Gerbe jointly in 1867, is perhaps now the most complete
book of its kind. But it has great faults and imperfections,
particularly as regards its indications of the distribution of the
species. This branch of the subject had never been properly
worked until the recent issue of Mr. Dresser's (formerly Sharpe
and Dresser's) "Birds of Europe," which contains, so far as it
lias hitherto progressed, by far the most exhaustive account of
the European birds yet attempted. Its large size and numerous
illustrations, however, render it rather cumbersome as a manual;

"Faune Politique," but his original observations are somewhat
meagre. Eichwald's "Fauna Caspio-Caucasica" and Menc-
tries's Catalogue of the Zoology of the Caucasus, should also be
consulted, although both are rather out of date. An excellent
zoologist, Hr. Gustav Radde, is now resident at Tiflis; but I do
not think he has yet prepared any general nccount of the birds
of the Caucasus, where there must be certainly much of inte-
rest, as is proved by the discovery of the remarkable Grouse,
allied to our Black Grouse, which has just been described by
M. Taczanowski.*
(h.) Birds of Germany and Central Europe. — Local lists of
the birds of the various States of Central Europe, and their
principal divisions, are very numerous; and there are also many
manuals and memoirs on the same subject. But J. A. Nau-
mann's excellent "Viigel Deutschlands," commenced in 1S22,
with its supplements, is still, I believe, quite unsuperseded
as a standard book of reference on Central F.uropean Orni-
thology. It was generally understood that Prof. Blasius, at the
time of his lamented death, had a work on the birds of his
native country in preparation ; but unfortunately this was never
finished, or it would have proved to be, no doubt, of first-rate
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
excellence. In no other country, however, except our own, is
ornithology so much cultivated as in Germany. Two societies
emulate each other in their pursuit of this science, and a special
journal h devoted to its progress. There is no lack, therefore,
of recent information upon the birds of every part of Germany,
although this has to be fished out of journals and periodicals of
different sorts, instead of being put together, as we should rather
wish to see it, in some general work.
(i.) Birds 0/ Scandinavia and North Europe.—In Scandinavia
also there is no dearth of diligent observers of birds as of every
other class of animals. The bird-volume of Nihson's Scandi-
navian Fauna was published in 1858, and is still worthy
of careful study. But the more recent works of Collett upon
the Birds of Norway, in German and in English, should
be consulted, as also Sundevall's "Svenska Foglarna,"
unfortunately not quite finished at the time of his decease,
• and Von Wright and Palmen's "Finland's Foglar." Many
memoirs have also recently appeared upon the birds of the ex-
treme north, which have always attracted great interest among
ornithologists. Amongst these special attention may be called
to v. Heuglin's account of the birds of Nova Zembla, first
published in Cabanis's Journal for 1S72, and afterwards
enlarged and revised in the second volume of his "Reisen in
dem Nordpolarmeer ;" to Prof. Newton s essay on the birds of
Iceland in Mr. Baring-Gould's " Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas;"
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and lastly, to Messrs. Alston and Brown's narrative of their
adventures among the birds of Archangel—a little explored
district, and one of much promise, to which one of these active
explorers has returned this year.
C. European Ilerpetology.
In this field of research there is not so much of recent work
to record as among the birds ; but Dr. E. Schrieber's "Herpe-
tologia Europaja," which has just appeared, marks an im-
portant epoch in this branch of science, since there was
previously no good work of reference upon the Reptiles and
Batrachians of Europe. Dr. Schrieber's work is drawn up upon
the same plan as Blasius's well-known "Saugethiere Europas,"
and forms a most convenient handbook. The list of published
works and memoirs on the same subject prefaced to it renders it
unnecessary for me to refer to the previous authorities on Euro-
pean herpetology in detail. I observe, however, that Lord
Clermont's very useful "Guide to the Quadrupeds and Reptiles
of Europe" is not referred to in the list, and it would
appear that Dr. Schrieber is not acquainted with it. I must
also call special attention to Dr. Strauch's excellent memoir on
the Serpents of the Russian Empire, recently published in

Pere Armand David, a worthy rival of our Consul, has likewise
contributed in no small degree to our knowledge of the fauna of
Northern China. His journals, containing numerous remarks
full of interest, have lately been published in the "Nouvelle
Archives du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris;" and
M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards's recently completed " Recherches
sur les Mammiferes" contains a section specially devoted to
the Mammals of Northern China, which is mainly based on Pere
David's researches. I shall, however, have again occasion to
mention the discoveries of both Mr. Swinhoe and M. David in a
subsequent portion of this address.

Temminck and Schlegel's "Fauna Japonica" have long
been our standard authority upon the zoology of Japan, and not
much has been done of late years to peifect it, except as regards
the birds. On this branch of our subject some very good
articles have been published in the "Ibis" by Capt. Blakiston,
based upon his researches in Hakodadi; by Mr. Whitely,
who was for some time resident along with Capt. Blackiston
at the same port; and by Mr. Swinhoe. Relerence should

6. THE TARTARIAN SUB-REGION.
Into the great desert-region of Central Asia, hitherto almost
unknown, except from Eversmann's "Reise nach Buchara,"
which contains a short natural-history appendix, excursions
have recently been made from two opposite quarters. The ad-
vancing tide of Russian conquest from the north, accompanied,
as usual, by its scientific corps, has already made us well ac-
quainted with the zoology of Turkestan. Mr. Severtzoff has
unfortunately yielded to tie unphilosophical spirit of nationality,
which has of late years attained such a monstrous development,
and published his "Turkestanskie Jevotnie," or review of the
distribution of animal life in Turkestan, in his native Rus-
sian. But a translation and reproduction of the portion relating

to the birds has already appeared in German, and an abstract
of it in English is now being given to the world by Mr. Dresser
in the "Ibis.";
From the south, the peaceful embassies of this country to Yar-
kand have led naturalists into the fringe oi the same zoological
district. Of the first of these expeditions we have an excellent
account as regards the birds by Mr. A. O. Hume, forming the
second part of Henderson's "Lahore to Yarkand." Sir D.
Forsyths second expedition to Yarkand and Kashgar was
accompanied by Dr. Ferdinand Stolitzska, one of the most ac-
complished and energetic members of the staff of the Indian
Geological Survey, whose life was miserably sacrificed to the
hardships encountered on the return. Of this last expedition we
have as yet only incomplete accounts,* but may, I trust, look
forward to the publication of an equally interesting volume on
the zoological results. The ichthyological part of the collections
has, I believe, been entrusted to Dr. F. Day to work out in this
country.

adjoining districts. But there is no perfect list of the Cape

and of which he has just issued the first part. Mr. Sharpe will
however, I trust, pardon me for remarking that he has cut the
synonymy of the species rather short in his pages. It is
hard to expect every South-African colonist to have at
his side the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, to which
he always refers us. Another modern and much-to-be-re-
commended bird-book belonging to this sub-region is Mr.
J. H. Gumey's "Birds of Damara-land" founded on the exten-
sive collection of the late C. J. Anderson. No less than 428
species of birds were obtained by this indefatigable collector,
and the task of editing his field-notes has been well performed
by Mr. Gurney.

to the scientific visit made to that country by Dr. \V. Peters,
of Berlin, in 1842 and the following years. The volume of
this distinguished naturalist, "Naturwissenschaftliche Reise
nach Mozambique," on the Mammals was published in 1852,
that on the Fishes in 1864. The delay in'the issue of the por-
tions relating to the Reptiles and Birds is much to be regretted,
more especially when we consider the high standard of the
work, although diagnoses of the new species discovered in these
groups have been long since published; and I am sure I
am expressing the sentiments of naturalists in general when I
say that I hope to see the series shortly completed. Proceeding
further north along the African coast, we come to Zanzibar,
where an excellent ichthyologist, Consul Playfair, was lately
resident. The " Fishes of Zanzibar," by Giinther and Playfair,
founded on the extensive collections here made, was pub-
lished in 1866, and gives an account of above 500 species,
and many excellent figures.
The ornithology of the whole East-African coast, from Cape
Gardafin to Mozambique, has been elaborately worked out by Drs.
Finsch and Hartlaub. The results are contained in these
authors' "Vogel Ost-Afrikans," forming the fourth volume of
the unfortunate Baron Carl Claus von der Decken's "Reisen
in Ost-Afrika." Full details as to older authorities on the
subject are given in this excellent work, so that it is not
necessary to refer to them.

As regards the Mammals of this part of Africa, however, it
is necessary to say a few words. Our knowledge of this class
of animals is, as regards the coast opposite Zanzibar and the
country surrounding the great lakes of the interior, mainly com-
prised in the fragmentary collections of Speke and Grant (of
which an account has been published in the Zoological Society's
"Proceedings," and in the few specimens transmitted by
Dr. Kirk from Zanzibar. There is no doubt, however, that
much remains to be done here, and I believe there is at the
present moment no finer field for zoological discovery available
than this district, where we know that animal life in every
variety is still abundant, and excellent sport can be obtained to
add a zest to scientific investigation. The fishes of the great
lake of Tanganyika and the Victoria and Albert Nyanza are
likewise utterly unknown, and their investigation would be a
subject of the greatest interest. Of those of the more southern
Nyassa Lake, a few specimens have been obtained by Dr.
Kirk.

j ournals and periodicals. I'rust that Mr. Edward Newton, who
has had so many opporlu-'l. -. of acquiring information on this
subject during his Colonial Secretaryship at Mauritius, and has
so well used these opportunities, may shortly have leisure to
devote to this task. His labours to recover the skeleton of
Pezophaps, in which, I am pleased to think, he was aided by a
grant from this Association, are well known, as is likewise the
excellent memoir by himself and Prof. Newton, in which the
result of his labours was given to the world. Nor must I omit
to mention Prof. Owen's dissertations on the extinct fellow-bird
of Mauritius, recently published by the Zoological Society.
As regards the recent ornithology of these islands, we have
nothing later to refer to than Hartlaub's little work on Mada-
gascar, noticed above, which includes what was then known of
the avifauna of the Mascarenes.
The neighbouring group of the Seychelles was visited by
Mr. Edward Newton in 1867, and several new and most
interesting species of birds obtained there. A complete account
of the ornithology of these islands was given by Mr. Newton in
the "Ibis" for 1867. Since that period Dr. E. P. Wright,
formerly an active member of this Association, has made a

generally understood, of preparing a complete mo nograph of
the [fauna and flora of these interesting islands. It is much
to be regretted that this very desirable plan has not yet been
accomplished.
III.-INDIAN REGION.
Of the extensive and varied Indian Region I will now proceed
to say something under the subjoined heads :—
1. British India.
2. Central and Southern China.
3. Burmak, Siam, and Cochin.
4. Malay Peninsula.
4</. Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
5. East-Indian Islands.
6. Philippine Archipelago.
I. BRITISH INDIA.
For British India Dr. Jerdon's well-known series of zoological
handbooks was intended to supply a long-standing want ; and
it is a great misfortune that his untimely death has interfered
with their completion. The three volumes on Birds were
finished in 1866, and one on Mammals in 1867. Of the
volume on the Reptiles and Batrachians a portion, I believe,
was actually in type at the time of his decease ; but of the Fishes
no part, as far as I know, was so much advanced. For the
Reptiles, therefore, we must for the present refer to Dr.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Giinther's "Reptiles of British India," published by the Ray
Society in 1864. Indeed, as regards India, any future account
of these animals must, in any case, be founded upon the basis of
that excellent and conscientious work. For the Indian tishes
generally there is at present no one authority, though Dr. Day,
author of the '' Fishes of Malabar" and of numerous other papers,
is understood to have in preparation a general work on this sub-
ject, which his office of Inspector-General of Indian Fisheries
has given him excellent opportunities of studying. Complete
lists of both the freshwater and marine species of India are given
in the appendices to Dr. Day's two "Reports on the Fisheries
of India and Burmab," published in India in 1873.
But although our wants as regards the Indian Vertebrates will
probably be supplied in this way, it would be much more satis-
lactory if the Indian Government would select a successor to
Dr. Jerdon, and place under his control the necessary means
for the preparation of a series of zoological handbooks for
India. There is no reason why botany should be more favoured
than zoology in this matter ; and I believe it is only the greater
energy of the botanist |that in this, as in other cases, has given
them the start. New editions of Dr. Jerdon's Mammals and

and that Dr. Anderson has now in preparation a connected
account of his Yucan discoveries, which is to be issued by the
Linnean Society in their "Transactions." A separate publica-
tion of these results would not have involved much additional
expense, and would have been more worthy of the Government
which sent out the expedition.
4. MALAY PENINSULA.
The Malay peninsula belongs unquestionably to the same
Sub-fauna as Sumatra. Its zoology is tolerably well known to
us from numerous collections that have reached this country,
but a modern revision of all the classes of Vertebrates is much
to be desired. About twenty years ago, Dr. Cantor, of the East
Indian Medical Service, published catalogues of the Mammals,
Reptiles, and Fishes of Malacca in the Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal. To obtain a knowledge of its birds we must
refer to the papers of Eyton, Wallace, acd various other orni-
thological writers.
ip., ANDAMAN AND NICORAR ISLANDS.
The two groups of islands in the Bay of Bengal have of late
years attracted considerable attention from naturalists. Port
lilair, in the Andaman Islands, having become the seat of an
Indian penal settlement, has received visits from several excellent

Indian workers who have made extensive collections, especially
in ornithology. The most recent authorities upon the biids
of the Andaman Islands are Lord Walden, who has worked
out the series forwarded to him by Lieut. Wardlaw Ramsay,
and Mr. Vincent Ball, who has published in "Stray Feathers"
a complete list of all the birds known to occur in the Andaman
and Nicobar groups.
5. EAST INDIAN ISLANDS.
Up to a recent period the standard authority on the fauna of
the East Indian Islands was the great Dutch work on tha
Zoology of the foreign possessions of the Netherlands Govern-
ment, based upon the vast collections formed by Macklot,
Muller, and other naturalists, and transmitted to the Leyden
Museum. This has been supplemented of late years by several
works and memoirs of Dr. Schlegel, the eminent director of
that establishment, and in particular by his "Musee des Pays
Bas," which contains an account of that magnificent collec-
tion drawn up in a series of monographic catalogues. Up
to this time, however, Dr. Schlegel has only treated of the
class of birds, though at the present moment, I believe, he is
engaged on a revision of Quadrumana. To the class of fishes,
and especially to the fishes of the Dutch Islands and Seas in
the East Indies, another naturalist, Dr. P. P. Bleeker, has for
many years devoted great attention. His memoirs and papers
on the Ichthyology and Herpetology of the various islands and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
settlements are far too numerous to mention. But his J" Atlas
Ichthyologique," his principal work on the Fishes of the Indian
Seas, is one of great importance, and claims a special record
as embracing the results of the life-work of one of the most
energetic and laborious of living naturalists.
The travels of our countryman, Mr. Wallace, in the Malay
Archipelago are well known to the general public from his
instructive and entertaining narrative, and to zoologists from the
large collections which he made in every branch of natural
history. It is a misfortune that no general account of them has
ever been prepared. But special articles on the birds of the
Sula group to the east of Celebes or those of Bourou, and on
those of the islands of Timor, Flores, and Lombock, will be
found in the Zoological Society's " Proceedings," besides other
ornithological papers referring more or less to this district.
Of the island of Celebes we have acquired more intimate
knowledge from the researches of Dr. A. B. Meyer, and from
two excellent memoirs on its Ornithology, prepared by Lord
Walden. The adjacent territory of Borneo has likewise not
escaped the attention of recent writers, an accomplished Italian
author, Dr. Salvador!, having made it the subject of a special

and previously unfigured species, and Copper's "Birds of
California," devoted to an account of the birds of the Pacific
coast-region, which has been edited by Prof. Baird from the late
Mr. Cooper's MSS. Of the last-named work, however, only the
first volume is yet published. It will be thus seen that we have
ample means of acquiring the most recent information on the
birds of the Nearctic Region, and in fact in no part of the world,
except Europe itself, is our knowledge of the endemic avifauna
so nearly approaching towards completion.
f (c.) Riflilis and Batrachians oj North America.—Holbrook's
"North American," in five quarto volumes, published at
Philadelphia in 1843-4, contains coloured figures of all the
North American Reptiles and Batrachians known to the
author, and is a reliable work. A large amount of information
has been acquired since that period and published in the vaiious
"Railway Reports " and periodicals by Hallowell, Baird, Cope,
and others. In 1853 Messrs. Baird and Girard published a
catalogue of North American Serpents, and Prof. Agassiz
devoted the first volume of his "Contributions" mainly to
the Testudinata of North America. Prof. Baird tells me that
Prof. Cope is now engaged in printing a new catalogue of the

Reptiles and Batrachians of North America, which will contain
an enumeration of all the species and ^an account of their
geographical distribution.
(d.)FisAes of North Amtrica.—Of the fishes of North America
there is up to the present time no one authority, and the in-
quirer must refer to the various works of De Kay, Agassiz,
and Girard for information. This, aided by the copious
references in Dr. Giinther's masterly Catalogue, he will have
little difficulty in obtaining, so far as it is available. But
the " History of American Fishes " is still to be written, and I
have no doubt that our energetic brethren of the United States
will before long bring it to pass.
2. GREENLAND.
Of Greenland, which is undoubtedly part of the Nearctic
Region, I have made a separate section in order to call special
attention to the "Manual" for the use of the Arctic Expedi-
tion of 1875, prepared under the direction of the Arctic
Committee of the Royal Society. A resume of all that is
yet known of the biology of Greenland is included in this
volume. I may call special attention to the article on the Birds
by Prof. Newton, and on the Fishes by Dr. Liitken, both pre-
pared specially for this work. I am sure you will all join with
me in thanking the present Government for sending out this new
expedition so fully prepared in every way, and in hoping that
large additions may be made to the store of information already

ADDRESS BY GEORGE ROLLESTON, M.D., F.R.S., F.S.A.,
PRESIDENT OF THE DEPARTMENT.
Dr. Rolleston began his address by referring to a few of the
. principal papers which were to be brought before the depart-
ment. He referred in congratulatory terms to the work in the
Pacific Islands brought out this year by Dr. Carl E. Meinicke,
and to an article^by the Rev. S. J. VVhitmee in the Contemporaiy
Review for February as the most important recent contribu-
tion to the ethnology of Polynesia. He then spoke in high
terms of the services rendered to the native Polynesians by the
missionaries, quoting to the same effect from Gotland's con-
tinuation of Wurtz's "Anthropologie." He also referred criti-
tically to Mr. Bagehot's statement that savages did not formerly
waste away before the classical nations, as they do now before
the modem civilised nations. He then went on to say :—
I come now to the consideration of the subject of craniology
and craniography. Of the value of the entirety of the physical
history of a race there is no question; but two very widely

Matters would be very different when the craniographer came
to deal with a mixed race like our own, or like the population of
Switzerland, the investigation into the craniology of which has
resulted in the production of the invaluable "Crania Helvetica"
of His and Riitimeyer. At once, upon the first inspection of a
series of crania, or, indeed, of beads, from such a race, it is
evident some are referable to one, some to another, of one, two,
or three typical forms, and that a residue remains whose exist-
ence and character is perhaps explained and expressed by calling
them "Mischformen. Then arises a most interesting question
—Has the result of intercrossing been such as to give a
preponderance to these "Mischformen?" or has it not rather
been such as in the ultimate resort, whilst still testified
to by the presence of intermediating and interconnecting links,
to have left the originally distinct forms still in something
like their original independence, and in the possession of an
overwhelmed numerical representation? The latter of these two
alternative possibilities is certainly often to be seen realised within
the limits of a modern so-called "English" or so-called "British"
family; and His has laid this down as being the result of the
investigations above mentioned into the ethnology of Switzer-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
land. At the same time it is of cardinal importance to note that
His has recorded, though only in a footnote, that the skulls
which combine the characters of his two best-defined types, the
"Sion-Typus" to wit, and the "Disentis-Typus," in the
"Mischform," which he calls "Sion-Disentis Mischlinge," are
the most capacious of the entire series of the "Crania Hel-
vetica," exceeding, not by their maximum only, but by their
average capacity also, the corresponding capacities of every one
of the pure Swiss types.* Intercrossing, therefore, is an agency
which in one set of cases may operate in the way of enhancing
individual evolution, whilst in another it so divides its influence
as to allow of the maintenance of two types in their distinctness.
Both these results are of equal biological, the latter is of pre-
eminent archaeological, interest. Retzius t was of opinion, and
with a few qualifications I think more recent Swedish ethnolo-
gists would agree, that the modern dolichocephalic Swedish cra-
nium was very closely affined to, if not an exact reproduction of
the Swedish cranium of the Stone period ; and Virchow J holds
that the modern brachycephalic Danish skull is similarly related
to the Danish skull of the same period. There can be no doubt
that the Swedish cranium is very closely similar indeed to the
Anglo-Saxon ; and the skulls which still conform to that type
amongst us will be by most men supposed to be the legitimate
representatives of the followers of Hengcst and Horsa, just as
the modern Swedes, whose country has been less subjected to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
disturbing agencies, must be held to be the lineal descendants of
the original occupiers of their soil. I am inclined to think that
the permanence of the brachycephalic stock and type in Den-
mark has also its bearing upon the ethnography of this country.
In the Round-Barrow or Bronze period in this country, sub-
spheroidal crania (that is to say, crania of a totally different
shape and type from those which are found in exclusive posses-
sion of the older and longer barrows) are found in great abun-
dance, sometimes, as in the south, in exclusive possession of the
sepulchre, sometimes in company, as in the norih, with skulls of
the older type. The skulls are often strikingly like those of the
same type from the Danish tumuli. On this coincidence I
should not stake much, were it not confirmed by other indica-
tions. And foremost amongst these indications I should place
the fact of the "Tree-interments," as they have been called—
interments, that is, in coffins made out of the trunk of a tree of
this country, and of Denmark, being so closely alike. The well-
known monoxylic coffin from Gristhorpe contained, together
with other relics closely similar to the relics found at Treenhoi,
in South Jutland, in a similar coffin, a skull which, as I can
testify from a cast given me by my friend Mr. H. S. Harland,

Wiltshire, in the Memoirs of the London Anthropologica'
Society for 1865 ; and the names of Les Eyzies and Cro-Magnon,
and of the Caverne de I'Homme Mort, to which we may add
that of Solutre, remind us that the first of these facts has been
confirmed, and the second both indicated and abundantly com-
mented upon by M. Broca.
The impression which these facts" make upon one, when one
first comes to realise them, is closely similar to that which is
made by the first realisation to the mind of the existence of a
subtropical flora in Greenland in Miocene times. All our antici-
pations are precisely reversed, and in each case by a weight of
demonstration equivalent to such a work ; there is no possibility
in either case of any mistake; and we acknowledge that all that
we had expected is absent, and that where we had looked for
poverty and pinching there we come upon luxurious and exube-
rant growth. The comparisons we draw in either case between
the past and the present are not wholly to the advantage of the
latier: still such are the facts. Philologists will thank me for
reminding them of Mr. Chauncy Wright's brilliant suggestions
that the large relative size of brain to body which distinguishes,
and always, so far as we know, has distinguished the human
species as compared with the species most nearly related to it,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
may be explained by the psychological tenet that the smallest
proficiency in the faculty of language may "require more brain
power than the greatest in any other direction," and that "we
do not know and have no means of knowing what is the quan-
tity of intellectual power as measured by brains which even the
simplest use of language requires.*
And for the explanation of the pre-eminently large size of the
brains of these particular representatives of our species, the
tenants of prehistoric sepulchres, we have to bear in mind, first,
th»t they were, as the smallness of their numbers and the large-
ness of the tumuli lodging them may be taken to prove, the
chiefs of their tribes; and, secondly, that modem savages have
been known, and prehistoric savages may therefore be supposed,
to have occasionally elected their chiefs to their chieftainships
upon grounds furnished by their superior fitness for such posts—
that is to say, for their superior energy and ability. Some per-
sons may find it difficult to believe this, though such facts are
deposed to by most thoroughly trustworthy travellers, such as
Baron Osten Sacken, referred to by Von Baer, in the Report of the
famous Anthropological Congress at Gbttingen, in 1861, p. 22.
And they may object to accepting it, for, among other reasons,
this reason—to wit, that Mr. Gallon has shown us in his "Men
of Science, their Nature and Nurture," p. 98, that men of great
energy and activity (that is to say just the very men fitted to act
as leaders of and to commend themselves to savagesjt have ordi-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
narily smaller-sized heads than men possessed of intellectual
power dissociated from those qualities.
The objection I specify, as well as those which I allude to,
may have too much weight assigned to them; but we can waive
this discussion and put our feet on firm ground when we say that
in ail savage communities the chiefs have a larger share of food
and other comforts, such as there are in savage life, and have
consequently better and larger frames—or, as the Rev. S. Whit-
mee puts it (l.f.), when observing on the fact as noticed by him
in Polynesia, a more "portly bearing." This (which, as the
size of the brain increases within certain proportions with the
increase of the size of the body, is a material fact in every sense)
has been testified to by a multitude of other observers, and is, to
my mind, one of the most distinctive marks of savagery as
opposed to civilisation. It is only in times of civilisation that
men of the puny stature of Ulysses or Agesilaus are allowed
their proper place in the management of aftairs. And men of
such physical size, coupled with such mental calibre, may take
comfort, if they need it, from the purely quantitative conside-
ration, that large as are the individual skulls from prehistoric
graves, and high, too, as is the average obtained from a number

readily enough explicable by a reference to the operations of
causes exemplifications of the working of which are unhappily
not far to seek now, and may be found in any detail you please
in those anthropologically interesting (however otherwise un-
pleasant) documents, the Police Reports.
Having before my mind the liability we are all under falla-
ciously to content ourselves with recording the shots which hit, I
must not omit to say that one at least of the more recently
propounded doctrines in craniology does not seem to me to be
firmly established. This is the doctrine of "occipital dolicho-
cephaly" being a characteristic of the lower races of modern
days and of prehistoric races as compared with modem civilised
races. I have not been able to convince myself by my own
measurements of the tenability of this position ; and I observe
that Ihering has expressed himself to the same effect, appending
his measurements in proof of his statements in his paper, "Zur
Reform der Craniometrie," published in the "Zeitschrift fur
Ethnologic " for 1873. The careful and colossal measurements
of Aeby * and Weisbach t have shown that the occipital region
enjoys wider limits of oscillation than either of the other divi-
sions of the cranial vault. I have some regret in saying this,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
partly because writers on such subjects as "Literature and
Dogma" have already made use of the phrase "occipitally
dolichocephalic," as if it represented one of the permanent ac-
quisitions of science; and I say it with even more regret, as it
concerns the deservedly honoured names «f Gratiolet and of
Broca, to whom anthropology owes so much. What is true in
the doctrine relates, among other things, to what is matter
of common observation as to the fore part of the head rather
than to anything which is really constant in the back part
of the skull. This matter of common observation is to the
effect that when the ear is "well forward" in the head
we do ill to augur well of the intelligence of its owner.
Now, the fore part of the brain is irrigated by the carotid
arteries, which, though smaller in calibre during the first years
of life, during which the brain so nearly attains its lull size, than
they are in the adult, are nevertheless relatively large even in
those early days, and are both absolutely, and relatively to the
brain which they havo to nourish, much larger than the vertebral
arteries, which feed its posterior lobes. It is easy therefore to
see that a brain in which the fore part supplied by the carotids
has been stinted of due supplies of food, or however stunted in
growth, is a brain the entire length and breadth of which is
likely to be ill-nourished. As I have never seen reason to be-
lieve in any cerebral localisation which was not explicable by a
reference to vascular irrigation, it was with much pleasure that
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
I read the remarks of Messrs. Wilks and Moxon in their recently
published " Pathological Anatomy," pp. 207, 208, as to the in-
dications furnished by the distribution of the Tacchionian bodies
as to differences existing in the blood-currents on the back and
those on the fore part of the brain. These remarks are the
more valuable, as mere hydraulics, Professor Clifton assures me,
would not have so clearly pointed out what the physiological
upgrowths seem to indicate. Any increase, again, in the length
of the posterior cerebral arteries is pro lanto a disadvantage to
the parts they feed. If the blood-current, as these facts seem to
show, is slower^in the posterior lobes of the brain, it is, upon
purely physical principles of endosmosis and exosmosis, plain that
these segments of the brain are less efficient organs for the mind
to work with ; and here again, "occipital dolichocephaly " would
have a justification, though one founded on the facts of the nutri-

at the end of one of his logical treatises (Soph. Elench. cap.
xxxiv. 6). These are his words :—
"No other writer has surveyed the same field, or any great
part ot it, from a similar point of view. . . . The lucubrations
of Herder and other diffuse writers of the same description, while
some of them possess a merit of their own, are not concerned in
the same design, or directed towards the same scope. Their
object is to portray national character as resulting from combined
influences—physical, moral, and political. They abound in
generalisations, often in the speculative flights of a discursive
fancy, and afford little or no aid for the close induction from
facts, which is the aim of the present work. Nor have these
inquiries often come within the view of writers on geography,
though the history of the globe is very incomplete without that
of its human inhabitants." A generation has scarcely passed
away since these words were published in 1841 ; we are living in
1875 ; yet what a change has been effected in the condition of
anthropological literature! The existence of such a dignified
quarterly as the "Archiv fiir Anthropologic" bearing on its title-
page in alphabetical order the honoured names of V. Baer, of

Lucie, of Rutimeyer, of Schaafhausen, of Semper, of Virchow,
of Vogt, and of Welcker, is in itself perhaps the most striking
evidence of the advance made in this time, as being the most
distinctly ponderable and in every sense the largest anthropological
publication of the day.
Archaeology, which but a short time back was studied in a
way which admirably qualified its devotees for being called
"connoisseurs," but which scarcely qualified them for being
called men of science, has by its alliance with natural history
and its adoption of natural history methods, and its availing
itself of the light afforded by the great natural history principles
just alluded to, entered on a new career. There is, as regards
natural history, anatomy, and pathology, nothing left to be
desired for the conjoint scheme represented by the periodical
just mentioned, where we have V. Baer for the first and Virchow
for the last, and the other names specified for the rest of these
subjects ; whilst archaeology, the other party in the alliance, is
very adequately represented by Lindenschmidt alone. But when
I recollect that Prichard published a work "On the Eastern
Origin of the Celtic Nations" ten years before the volume of
"Researches," from which I have just quoted, and that this
work has been spoken of as the work "which has made the
greatest advance in Comparative Philology during the present
century," I cannot but feel that the Redaction of the "Archiv

NOTES
The Valorous, which accompanied the two Arctic ships, the
Alert and the Discovery, as far asDisco, with coals and provisions,
arrived at Plymouth on Sunday. She has really nothing remark-
able to tell, which is so far satisfactory. Se»ere storms were
met with in crossing the Atlantic, but all three vessels seem to
have borne themselves well, though the Alert and Discovery each
lost a whale boat, a loss which was made up to them by the
Valorous before leaving Disco. The Valorous was the first to
reach Disco, which she did on July 4, the other two not coming
up till the 6th. The ships remained together at Disco till the
15th, the two exploring vessels filling up from their conscrt as
much coals and provisions as they could stow away. During
their stay at Disco, officers and men seem to have enjoyed them-
selves and to have been treated with the greatest courtesy and
kindness by the Danish officials and the natives. Mr. Kraup
Smith, the Inspector of North Greenland, had orders from his
Government to pay every attention to the Expedition, and he
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
carried out his instructions most liberally. He provided the
Expedition with sixty-four dogs and an Esquimaux. While at
Disco the naturalists of the three ships were employed collecting
botanical and geological specimens on shore and dredging in and
outside the harbour. A very large number of plants were found,
some believed to have been previously unknown in this part of
Greenland. The Alert and Discovery having been put into com.
plete trim, the Expedition left Godhavn on July 15, and on the
16th the Valorous took leave of her consort ships, afcer seeing
them fairly on their way to their work in the high north. The
Danish officials' reports as to the weather are favourable, leading
to the belief that the navigation of Melville Bay and northwards
will be comparatively easy. It is hoped that suitable winter
quarters will be found for the Discovery on the north shore of
Lady Franklin's Strait, from whence hunting parties will issue.
The Alert will then press onwards| alone to the north, landing
depots, building cairns with records at intervals of,about sixty
miles. The surest way of reaching the Pole, in Captain Nares's
opinion, is not to risk failure by pushing forward away from the

THE SCIENCE COMMISSION REPORT ON
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE*
UNDER head III. is brought forward the " Evidence
relating to the Establishment of Physical Observa-
tories."
On the general question of the establishment and
maintenance of Physical Observatories, Lord Salisbury
agrees that—
". ¦ . Some of these institutions which have been
alluded to in your grace's question, especially observa-
tories, clearly fall within the duties of the Government;
and certainly, from all that one hears, it is probable that
their duty in that respect is inadequately performed, and
that observatories for a much larger range of observations
might with great advantage be multiplied." ....
Sir George Airy, Astronomer Royal, thus states his
view on the subject:—
"When I began to be an astronomer, such questions
as those of the constitution of the sun and the like were
not entertained." ....
"Are you prepared to express an opinion as to whether
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
it is an object which would be a proper one for the Go-
vernment to take up as a State Establishment ?—The
Government are already pushed very hard in their esti-
mates. The screw is always put upon them, ' Cannot
you reduce the estimates a little more?' And then it
would always come to a question of extensive feeling in
the House of Commons, and of popular feeling out of the
House of Commons ; and I am contident from what I have
seen that those two bodies would not in every case support
an extension." ....
"Should you say that it is an object which is not very
likely to be prosecuted with sufficient vigour unless taken
up by the Government?—I do not see how it could go on
except it were taken up by the Government. I do not
believe that it could go on in any other way."
"It is not likely, you think, to be prosecuted by private
individuals, or by other public bodies such as the Univer-
sities ?—No, I think that their funds are almost all
required for other objects, and the difficulty even of get-
ting the business into shape is extremely great." . . . .
"Then such observations, in all probability, will either
not be made at all or must be taken up by the Govern-
ment ?—That is my view." ....
Mr. De la Rue's opinion is thus given in reply to
question 13,066 :—
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"I think that the time for the State providing means
for reducing observations has now come : when the State
should take up, besides mathematical astronomy (which
deals with the places of the stars and planets, and the
moon especially), physical observations, more particularly
observations of the sun, which appear to me to bear
directly upon meteorological phenomena." ....
Sir W. Thomson points out the importance of multi-
plying such Observatories :—
". . . In respect to the observatories, it might be
necessary to have several observatories for astronomical
physics in this country, if it were only to secure observa-
tions of interesting conjunctures, notwithstanding the
varieties of the weather, that there may be in different
parts of the country; and, again, observatories for astro-
nomical physics ought most certainly to be founded in
other parts of the British dominions than England, Ire-
land, and Scotland; in other latitudes and on the other
side of the world;"

not recommend the establishment of an independent
Government observatory for the cultivation of astrono-
mi:al physics in England.
In connection with some points on which differences of
opinion have been expressed in this evidence, a paper was
handed in by Col. Strange, consisting of questions ad-
dressed by him to Prof. Sir W. Thomson, Prof. Hilgard,
the Secretary of the American National Academy of
Sciences, and Prof. Balfour Stewart, and to M. Faye, the
President of the French Academy of Science.
Col. Strange's questions were as follows :—
"i. Is the systematic study of the solar constitution
likely to throw light on subjects of terrestrial physics, such
as meteorology and magnetism?
"2. What means, at present known to science, are
available for studying the sun?
"3. Do you consider that photography (one of the
assumed means) will suffice for the purpose?
"4. Do you consider that the class of observations
(defined in your answer to my question 2) are such as
can be efficiently made in an observatory maintained by

the State, or that any of them would be better left to the
zeal of volunteer astronomers?
"5. Do you consider that it would be advantageous to
carry on physico-astronomical researches on an extensive
scale, and meridional observations, in one and the same
observatory, under a single director?"
We regret that our space will not permit us to give the
replies of these eminent men to Col. Strange's questions.
They were, however, strongly in favour of the establishment
of physical observatories on a footing quite distinct from
existing meridional observatories, and equipped with the
laboratories and workshops without which such institu-
tions would be useless. We commend to all who are
interested in this question the perusal of this correspon-
dence, which is to be found as Appendix vii. to vol. ii.
pp. 27-31. Its value is enhanced by the fact that two of
the writers, Prof. Hilgard and M. Faye, are distinguished
foreign men of science.
Evidence relating to Meteorology.
Under this head a considerable amount of evidence
was taken, particularly as to the constitution, objects, and
results of the Meteorological Office.
This Office is under the management of the Meteoro-
logical Committee of the Royal Society, the functions of
which are thus described in the report annually presented
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to Parliament:—
"The Meteorological Committee consists of Fellows of
the Royal Society who were nominated by its President
and Council, at the request of the Board of Trade, for the
purpose of superintending the meteorological duties for-
merly undertaken by a Government Department, under
the charge of Admiral Fitzroy.
•' The Committee are credited with a sum of io,oooo/.
voted annually in the Estimates, for the administration
of which they are wholly responsible, and over which
they are given the entire control.
"The meetings of the Committee are held once a fort-
night, or oftener when necessary, when every subject on
which action has to be taken by their executive officers
receives their careful consideration. The duties of the
Committee are onerous and entirely gratuitous; they
were accepted and are very willingly performed by the
members, on account of the earnest desire they severally
feel for the improvement of meteorological science."
The position of the Committee is anomalous. In the
words of the director of the Meteorological Office—

39i
NA TURE
mittee under the essential condition that it had but a
limited sum of money to spend."
"Have any results of scientific importance in your
opinion been obtained by the action of the Committee ?—
In the direction of what one may call investigation of an
absolutely scientific character, I should say none at all.
Of course the observations that are made at the special
observatories are valuable scientific information, and so
far one has no right to say that scientific results have not
been produced; but I do not think that these can pro-
perly be referred to as specific results of anything that
the Committee has done. To the best of my belief there
has been nothing undertaken in the way of original in-
vestigation into the specific physical causes of any of
the phenomena which are recorded, nor any original
research, properly so called, in relation to any of the
several branches of meteorology. TShe Committee hardly
has appliances at its command for any such investi-
gations, and, the funds at its disposal being limited, it
was hardly possible that it should attempt them. It is
also no doubt quite true that the observations which are
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
made at the seven observatories do not include any mat-
ters which are of great importance in physical science, and
which would properly come within the range of meteo-
rology."
"Are the fund; at the disposal of the Committee in
your opinion insufficient for doing anything more than
has been actually done at present ?—I should say dis-
tinctly that this is the case. The Committee has always
considered that it is bound to attend primarily to
the special objects before referred to, which were in a
specific manner made over to it, and it finds that after
this has been done there is no money left for other things."
Again, the same witness expressed a decided opinion
that the State should do more for the promotion of meteo-
rological science than it does at present, but entertains
some doubt whether any increased duties could advan-
tageously be allowed to devolve upon a body such as
the Meteorological Committee.
The same view is expressed by Professor Balfour
Stewart:—
"Would you organise the Meteorological Committee
in any really different form to that which at present
obtains ?—I should be inclined to dispense with the
Meteorological Committee altogether, and substitute
a Meteorologist Royal, or whatever his appellation might
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be, a single official who should be responsible to the
Government in the same way as the Astronomer Royal is
responsible for his department. I do not see why the one
department should be on one footing and the other depart-
ment on a different footing. 1 think that there are grave
disadvantages with a department administered by an un-
paid committee."
"Would you appoint a Meteorologist Royal corre-
sponding with the Astronomer Royal?—Yes, whatever
the name might be; I should appoint an official very
much corresponding to the Astronomer Royal, and respon-
sible to the same extent. A board of visitors would not
be objectionable, but the direction of an unpaid com-
mittee appears to me to be very objectionable."*
Evidence relating to Tidal Observations.
Evidence in reference to tidal observations has been
placed before the Commission by Dr. Joule and Prof. Sir
W. Thomson.
Dr. Joule is of opinion that—
"With regard to the sea level and the tides, although
the laws with regard to the tides are pretty well known,

us, both by statesmen and men of science, is to the same
eflect, and in favour of increased State aid. It has also
especially been urged upon us, that to afford, by direct
pecuniary aid, the means of livelihood to men of distinc-
tion in pure investigation would be a great advantage to
science, as competent investigators would thus be enabled
and encouraged to pursue a strictly scientific career."
Lord Salisbury is of opinion that the cause of science is
hindered by the want of a sufficient career for scientific
men, giving the following statement of his reasons :—
<L I am induced to think so, by noticing how very much
more rapid the progress of research is where there is a
commercial value attached to the results of it, than in
other cases. The peculiar stimulus which has been given
to electrical research, in the particular direction of those
parts of it which concern the telegraph, is a very good
instance in point, and the extent to which researches into
organic chemistry have almost clustered themselves round
the production of coal tar colours is another instance in
point. And therefore it is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that research is really hindered by the necessity under
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
which those who are most competent to conduct it feel
themselves, of providing for their own support by means
of the talent and the knowledge which they possess."
With regard to the scale on which such remuneration or
• payments for maintenance should be made, Lord Salis-
bury observes :—
"I should say, taking the parallel [that of certain offices
in die Church], to which I have already alluded, that an
income of about 1,000/. or 1,500/. a year would be the
kind of income which would suffice for the purpose that I
have in view."
And he would also add provision for retirement.
With reference to the safeguards against abuse which
would be necessary, Lord Salisbury continues :—
"... It would, for their [the investigators'] own interest,
and to save them from invidious comments, be desirable
to impose upon them the necessity of publishing, either
in the form of books or in the form of lectures (but not
sufficient in number really to impede their work), an
account of the result of their labours during each succes-
sive year. Perhaps one or two stated lectures in the
course of a year, to be delivered to University students,
would be the best means of imposing upon them that test
of industry."
Lord Derby takes the same view :—
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"I think that, in one way or another, where you have a
man of very great eminence as a scientific discoverer, it
is unquestionably the duty of the State to provide him
with means and leisure to carry on his work. Whether
that is to be done by giving him an office under the
British Museum, or in any similar institution, or whether
it is to be done by simply granting him a pension in
recognition of eminent scientific service, or in whatever
other way it is done, it seems to me to be immaterial, but
1 certainly consider that it is a very important part of the
public duty, to relieve men who have shown an eminent
capacity for original discovery and research from the
necessity of engaging in a lower kind of work as a means
of livelihood." . . .
Sir W. Thomson, in a reply to which we have already
referred, stated his opinion on this point as follows :—
"That men should be enabled to live on scientific re-
search is a matter of most immediate consequence to the
honour and welfare of this country. At present a man
cannot live on scientific research. If he aspires to devote
himself to it he must cast about for a means of supporting

waters and territorial seas. Legislation, attended on the
¦whole with marked success, has led to the development of
the salmon fisheries of the United Kingdom; a much
less successful attempt has been made to increase the
produce of our exhausted oyster fisheries; and a very
able Commission, which enjoyed the advantage of Prof.
Huxley's assistance, has investigated and authoritatively
disproved the allegation that our sea-fish were decreasing.
In England and Scotland, at any rate, satisfaction is
usually expressed at this state of things. With the
single exception of the oyster, the harvest of the sea
proves annually as productive, or even more productive,
than ever, while the increasing consumption of a growing
population and the greater destructiveness of modern im-
plements of fishing, are not apparently unduly diminish-
ing the numbers of our sea-fish. Ireland, however, to
judge from the language of her representatives in Par-
liament, is less satisfied with her position. The very
fish, if we may credit some authorities, are deserting the
coasts of this unhappy country ; and Irish fishermen, with
their old tackle worn out, and with no money to purchase

side of the Atlantic. The picture annually presented to
us of the miserable condition of Irish fishermen was so
deplorable, that Parliament, last year, was induced to
interfere. The Ministry was surprised by a hurried
division, and unexpectedly defeated by a narrow ma-
jority. Its defeat compelled it to place a portion of the
Irish Reproductive Fund at the disposal of the Irish
Inspectors of Fisheries; and the Inspectors are now
enabled to lend small sums of money to needy fishermen
on their personal security. No such loan has yet been
made. But, on the eve of adopting a new policy, it is
occasionally desirable to review the circumstances which
have led to it; and we turn, for this reason, to the
recently published report of the Inspectors of Irish
Fisheries.
The Report is divisible into two portions. The first
and shorter portion refers to Sea Fisheries, Oyster Fish-
eries, and Harbours ; the second and longer portion to
the Inland or Salmon Fisheries. The salmon fisheries
of Ireland are fairly prosperous. The amendments which
are required in the law are not numerous or important;
and we do not therefore propose to follow the Inspectors
into their review of them. But the ten pages of the Re-
port which are devoted to the sea fisheries and oyster

fisheries of Ireland, deserve for every reason most atten-
tive consideration. The oyster fisheries occupy a very
short space in the Report, and may be dealt with in the
first instance. The Inspectors have exercised almost
absolute powers in dealing with this question. They are
authorised to appropriate to any individual who applies to
them, large portions of the fore shore of Ireland, and 130
licensed beds, occupying 18,825 acres of fore shore and
sea-bottom, have thus been appropriated. The result of
this wholesale appropriation of public dredging ground
might well have justified Parliamentary interference.
"The chief object," say the Inspectors, "in granting
licenses (cultivation) has not been fulfilled. In the majo-
rity of cases we believe there has not been anything
deserving to be called an attempt to cultivate the ground
granted. The proprietors in numerous instances content
themselves with getting as much as they can for their
private use, and do nothing to replenish. We would be
fully justified in cancelling the majority of the licenses."
We quite agree with the Inspectors in this view ; but we
should like to know why some of the licenses have not

their own waters. But no one ever saw an Irish fishing-
boat in either a Scotch or English sea. The Englishmen
and Scotchmen, with their capital continuously employed
throughout the year, beat, of course, the Irishman who
leaves it idle and unemployed for three-fourths of it.
The view which we have thus expressed is not, how-
ever, shared either by the friends of Ireland or the Irish
Inspectors. In their eyes the decrease in the number of
Irish fishermen is equivalent to the decay of the Irish
fisheries ; and both of these are due to the unsympathetic
attitude of this country. Last year nothing would do any
good but loans. Now that the Reproductive Loan Fund
has been utilised for this purpose with effects which we
shall immediately notice, nothing will do any good but a
safe and commodious harbour at Arklow. Such a har-
bour " is most necessary for the successful prosecution of
both herring and oyster fisheries," and "unless something
be done, there is little hope of any substantial improve-
ment." We have no desire to discourage the construction
of safe and commodious harbours, but we should like to
ask the Irish Inspectors whether they ever heard of a

place in England called Yarmouth. It is as important a
fishing station as Arklow, it is on as stormy a shore; but
when a storm is raging, the Yarmouth fishermen have to
stand out to sea to avoid being'driven on to the coast. We
never heard that the want of a harbour at Yarmouth had
destroyed the Yarmouth fishery; and we think that Yar-
mouth has at least as good a claim as Arklow for the con-
struction of such a harbour. The new system of loans to
fishermen remains for consideration. There has, of course,
been no want of applicants for the loans. 2,800 indi-
viduals have already applied for the money, and we have
no doubt there are a good many more quite prepared to
follow their example. 1,300 of the 2,800 applications
emanate from County Gahvay, and 160 of these applicants
live in one parish. No more than six of the 160 "fulfil
the conditions which should entitle them to obtain a
loan!" We presume that as the Inspectors pointedly refer
to the 160 applicants, they may be regarded as fair
examples of the 2,800 who have applied. In that case
only 105 persons throughout Ireland will, in the lenient
judgment of the promoters of the policy, be entitled to
participate in the loan. Is it possible to conceive a more
striking illustration of the consequences of the policy?

one of these. "The red grouse is about the best game

bird in the whole world, and deserves all the care we can
bestow upon him." This care involves the annihilation
of every creature that shows the least disposition to
destroy and feed upon the eggs, young, or adult of
Lagopus scoticus; and the death-list is no small one, in-
cluding eagles, buzzards, hen harriers, all other Raptores,
ravens, crows, magpies, wild foxes, polecats, stoats, and
weasels. The stomachs of hawks are often found to con-
tain the remains of weasels and rats; why kill them if
they destroy those vermin ?" If an alderman were ship-
wrecked on an uninhabited island, he would probably live
upon the contents of a cask of biscuits which might be
washed ashore. But the scientific gentleman among a
party of savages who might examine him after his friends
who happened to land on that island had killed him for
their supper, would, we know, arrive at an erroneous con-
clusion if he entered it in his note-book as a fact that
the animal alderman lived entirely on dry biscuit." This
running analogy is the argument employed throughout
the book, and it is this which makes it a particularly
amusing one to glance through ; whether it carries con-
viction with it is a different thing. The grouse disease is
explained as depending on the fact that these birds, un-
like others, eat only one food, heather, and when this is
injured by cold or otherwise, they have no other to fall

afterwards produce unhealthy offspring is considered un-
likely. "Can we fancy a grouse telling his mate on a
spring morning, My dear, I feel very poorly to-day ; that
No. s in my spine is troubling me dreadfully?" The
author's raid against all the Raptores is very severe; he
in this, as in other points, being much opposed to the
general tenour of the report of the evidence given before
the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed in 1873.

Although no one acquainted with the care bestowed upon this
description of work at Greenwich would for one moment think
of impugning the accuracy of these estimations, they show pre-
cisely the excess of whole seconds that is taken in the before-
mentioned article as indisputably proving the carelessness of the
tabulations at the Kew Observatory.
As regards these averages, it is to be remarked that with one
slight exception all the numbers that are above or below the
theoretical average in one example are above or below in all, and
that there is only one case in which the range of difference
exceeds 3 per cent. The partiality shown for the figures o and

that the same person had made all the estimations.

error of any single determination is very small indeed, a remark
that will apply equally to the tabulations

To show that different observers have very different idiosyn-
crasies, I may append the following averages similarly deter-
mined, this time from the purely astronomical estimations of the
time of transit of stars across the well-defined spider lines of
the telescope by the method known as eye and ear observa-
tion, these estimations being made on a precisely similar principle.

A Lunar Rainbow?
There can be little doubt that your Australian correspondent,
Mr. Lefroy (vol. xii. p. 329), has seen one of the phases of an
Aurora Australia. Similar appearances have been observed by
me in Scotland, passing south of the zenith (and nearly through
the anti-dip, as at Fremantle). Their sudden occurrence and
temporary persistence are perplexing to those who have not seen
this particular display before. The first seen by myself (in 1844,
I think) was a single beam which remained in the same position
during some hours ; it was described by me next day in a local
paper, while a well-known observer in a communication to an
Edinburgh journal had taken it for a comet.
It is pleasant to see accounts of such phenomena'sent to
Nature from all parts of the world, even when the true cause
has not always been apparent. It is not improbable that the

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
M. Leverrier's Theory of Saturn.—Early in the
year 1874, M. Leverrier presented to the Paris Academy
of Sciences the conclusions he had drawn from the com-
parison of his analytical theory of the planet Jupiter with
the meridian observations made at Greenwich and Paris
during the long period of 120 years, which he found
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to be represented thereby with all desirable precision;
thus proving that the motion of Jupiter is not subject to
any sensible action beyond the effects of the known
planets.
The comparison of the theory of Saturn with a similar
extended course of normal positions, each one based upon
a great number of observations, has not run quite so
smoothly, but, on the contrary, has presented some slight
difficulties, upon which M. Leverrier makes known his
opinion, in a communication to the Paris Academy on
the 23rd of last month. During the thirty-two years of
modern observations, 1837-69, the differences between
theory and calculation, except in two instances, remain
below o-2s. in the times of passage observed on the
meridian ; for the older observations of Maskelyne and
Bradley, somewhat larger discordances are shown. The
residuals are, however, upon the whole, very small, and a
question arises, whether such quantities can be legitimately
neglected, or, if not, whether their cause is to be sought
in incompleteness of the analysis or in errors of the
observations themselves. M. Leverrier has not been

actions," it may possibly be the author's intention to
append them to a future communication to the Royal
Society, in continuation of other important papers already
published in the "Transactions,"—a place which the Tables
will advantageously occupy. They give with sun's longi-
tude as argument, the inclination of the solar axis to the
circle of declination, reckoned positive when the axis is
west of the north point of the sun's disc, and assuming
the inclination of his equator to the ecliptic to be 7° I5''o,
and the longitude of its ascending node 74° - v; and with
argument, sun's longitude + v, the "Heliographical lati-
tude of the earth" and "Reduction of longitude." The
obliquity of the ecliptic is taken, 23° 2/-5, but to correct
the angle between the circle of declination and the sun's
axis, for difference of true and assumed obliquity, a sup-
plementary table is provided.
The Tables have been calculated by Mr. Marth, and it
will be obvious to anyone initiated in such work, that
considerable trouble has been taken to ensure their accu-
rate production.

SCIENCE IN GERMANY
(From a German Correspondent.)
for a small number of elements and their com-
^-' pounds is the relatively low temperature of the non-
luminous gas flame sufficient to produce spectra which
can be of use in analytical researches; by far the
larger number turn into vapour at such degrees of tem-
perature as vve can obtain solely by the electric spark.
We are therefore confined to spark spectra for such
bodies which do not give spectra in the flame, and these
spark spectra can all the less be dispensed with in
those cases where new elements are sought for, or where
it is a question of proving beyond all doubt the presence
of certain bodies, which in their chemical properties are
so much alike that ordinary reagents do not suffice for
their discovery or separation.

But there are difficulties in the way of practically using
spark spectra, which have been the reason why these
important means of reaction have not yet found their
entry into all chemical laboratories. First of all, a
simple method has been wanting by which spark
spectra can be obtained at any time. Whoever has
been obliged to use currents of great intensity with tem-
porary interruptions of days, weeks, or months, knows
how much unpleasantness is caused by fitting, taking
to pieces, and cleaning the ordinary constant batteries
used hitherto. Another difficulty lies in the fact that
spectrum tables are still wanting which would be of suffi-
cient service for all practical purposes. It is true that a
large quantity of measurements have been published, and
doubtless some of them are extremely accurate, but with
the greatest part of them the purity of the substances
experimented with is not in the least guaranteed, and
very often it can be proved not to have been attended to
at all. If it is attempted to reduce to a universal scale

only for practical purposes, but also from A theoretic point
of view, to compare the consumption of zinc during the
generation of the current with that in the unconnected bat-
tery, as theory alone gives no basis on which to decide
the question whether the zinc disssolved in the uncon-
nected battery is entirely, partly, or not at all used in the
connected battery for the generation of the current. In-
vestigation showed that the quantity of zinc dissolved in
the disconnected battery is a little under half of the con-
sumption of zinc necessary acording to theory to generate
the current in the connected battery, and that only a part
of the metal dissolved in the disconnected battery without
current-generation is used up in the connected one for
the generation of the current. This fact entirely corre-
sponds with the view that the dissolution of the zinc
must not be looked upon as the cause of the current, but
as a necessary condition of the same. Investigation
further showed that while in the chromic acid battery
above described, on the average only 22 per cent, of
zinc was lost, the loss in the nitric acid battery expe-
rimented with was 48 per cent, on the average. The

chromic acid battery without clay cells is the least
constant one amongst the ordinary constant batteries.
But if used in a proper manner it may serve for a
very long time. Prof. Bunsen possesses a battery of
this kind, of forty pairs, with an active zinc surface on
each plate of only forty square cm. For the last eight
lecture-terms it has served for all experiments without
its having been necessary during this long time to renew
the zinc plates, or their coatings of wax, or the original
exciting liquid, nor to clean the conducting connection
parts; it has been merely necessary to renew now and
then the amalgamation of the zinc plates (an operation
which only takes a few minutes of time) and to replace
that part of the liquid which was lost by evaporation in
the air, by simply filling the cylinders with water up to
the marks on their sides. The apparatus to this day
still gives an electric arc between carbon points which
amply suffices for the photo-chemical lecture experiments.
The currents obtained by this battery, which has now
been in use for already more than four years, are still
powerful enough for demonstrations in electrolysis, spark
spectra, decomposition of gases by induction sparks,
&c, and will doubtless continue to suffice for all these
purposes for some time to come. But we must again
repeat that effects of such magnitude can only be ex-

pected if the precaution is used (and it is very easy to do
so) not to leave the pairs in contact with the liquid for
one moment longer than the duration of the current
necessary for the experiments requires it.
The battery used for the production of spark spectra
consists of four of the pairs above described. The pole
wires conduct the primary current, of which a branch
puts the current interruptor into action, to a Ruhmkorff
apparatus, the induction coil of which has a diameter of
nearly o'2 metres and a length of 05 metres. The cur-
rent induced in the same is conducted to the spark appa-
ratus, standing in front of the slit of the spectroscope:
a, a bottle with three necks, serves as a stand for the
spark apparatus. The induced current goes from the
mercury cup b, through the fine wire c to the carbon point
d, which is fastened on a pointed platinum wire; thence
it passes as a spark to the other carbon point e, and from
this it reaches the second mercury cup f, which is con-
nected with the other end of the induction coil. The
platinum wires, which are surrounded by glass, tubes
sealed firmly upon them, can be moved upwards or down-

regular in the progress of hurricanes, and the observed
fact that in every disastrous storm the wind appeared to
move in a circle. They said to themselves: "We do not
seek to know how storms are formed, but how they pro-
gress." Instead of speculating, as did former meteoro-
logists, on storms of aspiration, on the role of electricity,
on the conflict of opposing currents, &c, they collected
for each tempest extracts from the log-books of all the
ships which had been involved in it. After having
abstracted and arranged this immense quantity of ma-
terial, they marked upon a chart, at certain dates, the
positions of these ships and the direction of the winds
observed. Then, by placing on this chart, after several
trials, a series of tissue-papers on which had been drawn
concentric circles, they made sure that the wind-arrows at
the same instant closely coincided with these circles, so that
at that very instant, over all the region subjected to the
storm, the mass of air resting on the ground or on the sea
must have been acted on by a vast gyrating movement
around a centre. Some idea of the nature of these re-

searches will be obtained from Fig. I, which shows a very
small part of the chart of the hurricane which ravaged the
island of Cuba in 1844. Redfield collected sufficient
information to determine the figure of the hurricane at
twenty-five different times, between Oct. 4 and 7 ; the figure
shows two of these. The same phenomenon was repro-
duced at all the other times; everywhere the hurricane
assumed this strikingly circular form.
All tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes, present the same
character wherever they occur, and they preserve it
throughout the entire duration, and over all their area,
which often extends to more than 600 leagues. The con-
clusion is evident ; there is evidence here of a vast rota-
tory movement, definitively confined to one portion of
our atmosphere, which is at the same time subjected to a
movement of translation.
It is remarkable that when all the separate results
obtained over the whole of the northern hemisphere are
compared, it is seen that the gyration takes place always
and everywhere from right to left, in a direction opposite
to that of the hands of a watch (see Fig. 1). Still more
remarkable is it that over all the southern hemisphere the
same law, the same gyration is found, but in a direction
opposite to that of the preceding, from left to right, i.e.,
the same direction as that of the hands of a watch. There

tion; these terrible gyratory movements turn constantly

southern hemisphere.
Finally, the trajectories present some very striking
common characteristics in each hemisphere, and in both
hemispheres a remarkable symmetry. The lines tracked
by the centres of these cyclones do not descend directly
from the equator to either pole; on the contrary, they
incline first to the west, then, after having passed the limit
of the trade-winds, they bend towards the east, in a
final direction roughly perpendicular to the former. Fig. 2
will enable the reader to follow in the two hemispheres
the development of cyclones. Originating not far from
the zone of calms or of variable winds, on both sides of
the equatorial zone, they measure scarcely more than two
or three degrees at the outset, but as they proceed towards
higher latitudes their area gradually enlarges. In the
two temperate zones they attain a diameter of more than
ten degrees, and frequently occupy upon the terrestrial

a certain force, it is easy to determine the direction in
which the centre of the cyclone will be found. The
following is Piddington's rule :—Turn the face to the
wind and stretch out the right arm; the centre is in this
direction. The left arm must be used when a ship is in
1 he southern seas. Soon the wind increases, and the fall
of the barometer becomes more rapid ; the centre is getting
nearer, for the cyclone has an onward motion. If the
wind continues to increase without changing direction,
you are in the very path of the centre, and soon you will
be in the very heart of the tempest. Then suddenly a
calm ensues; at the centre of the cyclone exists a circular
space where a relative calm prevails. There the sky
reassuming its serenity, the sailor might be led to believe
himself safe; but this space is soon passed, and imme-
diately the tempest recommences. Only the wind has
suddenly jumped round 180 degrees; it blows now in the
direction opposite to the previous one, at right angles to
the trajectory of the centre of the cyclone.
The situation which we have just supposed is a peculiar
case; in general the vessel will be found to the right or

far from being a matter of indifference; it is a question
of life or death, for the one corresponds to the favourable
semicircle, the other to the dangerous. The following is
Reid's rule, which eliminates all uncertainty :—In what-

itself, the favourable semicircle is indicated; if the wind

the proper rotation of the cyclone, the dangerous semi-
circle is indicated.
This may be accounted for by examining Fig. 3. The
observer, supposed to be immovable, has his face turned
towards the series of winds which will strike him succes-
sively as the cyclone passes over him.
In the favourable semicircle (southern hemisphere), if
the ship behaves well in a rough sea, it is possible to
avoid the centre and the cyclone itself by the shortest
way, perpendicularly to its trajectory. The storm is

the violence of the wind, the state of the sea, and the

Dr. Leitner's collections from Dardistan were among the
most attractive objects.
The concluding general meeting presented no remark-
able feature, and called forth no very notable speeches.
Among the papers to be printed in full in the Report is
that of Prof. Cayley, on the application of mathematical
trees to chemical theory. The local committee and
officials were thanked most heartily and deservedly.
They have had the best intentions, adequate means, and
good plans, and have employed the energy needed for the
fruition of their ideas. The actual number of members,
associates, and ladies present during the meeting was
2,249, the number having been somewhat swelled by late
arrivals.
The vote of thanks to the President, moved by Sir W.
Thomson and seconded by Dr. Carpenter, was not merely
formal. Sir W. Thomson eulogised Sir John Hawkshaw
as a man who believed that good practice proceeded from
good theory. Certainly the President's tone of mind
seems to have influenced the work and proceedings of the
meeting, for it has been on the whole quiet and genial,
yet busy and important in useful results obtained by the
scientific employment of common sense, if not of imagina-

Report of the Committee on Mathematical Tables.—The portion
of the report that had been prepared by Prof. Cayley during the
year contained a risumial works and memoirs on the theory of
numbers. The publication of the elliptic function tables had,
under the direction of Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher, proceeded during
the year, and the first sixty-four pages of the table, printed from
the stereotype plates, were exhibited to the Section. It was
expected that the whole table would be printed by the next
meeting. Mr. Glaisher stated that considerable additions had
been received from mathematicians relating to the report on
general tables, and that it was probable a supplementary report
on this subject might be presented at the next meeting of the
Association.
Ilyperelliptic Functions. —Mr. \V. H. L. Russell stated the

Mr. J. W.L. Glaisher, was appointed to report on mathematical
notation and printing, with the view of leading mathematicians
to prefer in optional case; such forms as are more easily put into
type, and of promoting uniformity of notation. The report
related wholly to printing, and contained a list of forms having
the same signification, the one requiring "justification," and the
other not (such as ex. gr. \Ja + x, and \/[a + x).) There were
also attached diagrams showing the mechanical operation of
setting up mathematical expressions in type, so that when there
were two forms equally satisfactory from the mathematical point
of view, writers might choose the one that would give the printer
less trouble ; as everything that tended to cheapen mathematical
printing tended to the spread of the science. With regard to
notation, the committee had thought it better not to report, feel-
ing that in presence of the differences of opinion that must exist,
it would be desirable that the matter should be discussed by a
larger committee. The committee was reappointed to report on
mathematical notation, with the addition of Sir Wm. Thomson,
Professors H. J. S. Smith and Henrici, and Lord Rayleigh.
Report of the Committee on Ticks, by Sir William Thomson.—
I le remarked that tides rise and fall in a series of harmonic vibra-
tions, like the various tones in music, some tidal waves being due
to the moon, others to the sun, others to meteorological causes.
Even the overtones in music—so thoroughly studied by Ilelm-
holtz—were represented in the tidal wav<s. The committee had
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
been engaged upo 1 tides foralongtime, and had shown theGovern-
ment, harbour authorities, and others interested, the way to con-
tinue the work, but it could do so itself no longer, for he believed
that day to be the last of the existence of the committee. The
calculations connected with tidal observations were of a laborious
nature. Col. Walker, of the Trigonometrical Survey of India,
had helped the committee very much by printing the forms re-
quired for the calculations. Col. Walker had also had a series
o( tidal observations nude in the Indian seas, and nvght possibly
send the results home to have the calcula'ions made from them.
The Indian Government would probably have further observa-
tions made, especially in an important new harbour they were
constructing at Madras. A great mass of other observations was
accumulating. Mr. H. C. Russell, the Government astronomer
at Sydney, had made several year;' tidal observations, but had been
obliged to stop them on account of the cessation of the grant lor
the work, but he hoped that the duty would be undertaken once
more ; as yet, the committee had no reductions whatever of tidal
observations in the southern hemisphere, and knew nothing
about the tides there. He had been promised a long series of
observations, extending over eighteen years, fr.m Bre^t, and he

adduced to prove that the corona is a real object, a matter
radiating by itself. The existence of a solar atmosphere situ-
ated beyond the chromosphere—an atmosphere which M.
Janssen had recognised in 1871, and proposed to call the coro-
nal atmosphere—thus receives confirmation. 2. Height of the
coronal atmosphere. In 1871 Dr. Janssen announced that the
coronal atmosphere extended from half the sun's radius to a
whole radius at certain points. This assertion has been con-
firmed not only by the direct views of the phenomenon, but also
by photography. At Dr. Janssen's request Dr. Schuster took
photographs of the corona with exposures of one, two, four, and
eight seconds. In this series of photographs the height of the
corona increases with the time of exposure. The height of the
corona in the eight-seconds' photograph exceeds at some points a
solar radius. (It is true that we ought to take account of the
influence of the terrestrial atmosphere.) 3. As the sky was not
of perfect clearness at Bangchallo, Dr. Janssen observed phe-
nomena that explain previous observations of eclipses which
seemed to invalidate the existence of the corona as a gaseous
incandescent medium. On the whole, the observations of the
5th of April, 1875, have advanced us a fresh step in the know-

ledge of the corona by bringing forward new proofs of the
existence of an atmosphere round the sun, principally gaseous,
incandescent, and very extended.
In his second paper Dr. Janssen stated the results obtained by
the expedition to Japan to observe the Transit of Venus. The
expedition, which was under Dr. Janssen's direction, divided into
two parts, the one taking up its station at Nagasaki and the
other at Kobi. At Nagasaki Dr. Janssen observed the transit
with an equatoreal of 8 inches aperture. (I) He obtained the
two interior contacts. (2) lie saw none of the phenomena of the
drop or of the ligament; all the appearances were geometrical.
(3) He observed facts which establish the existence of an atmo-
sphere to Venus. (4) He saw the planet Venus before her entry
on the sun, with suitable coloured glasses. This important ob-
servation proves the existence of the coronal atmosphere. (5)
There was taken at Nagasaki a plate of the revolver for the first
interior contact (6) M. Tis3erand observed the two interior
contacts with a 6-inch equatorial; the contacts were sensibly
geometrical. (7) Sixty photographs of the transit on silvered
plates were obtained ; and (S) also some other photographs (wet
collodion and albumenised glass). At Kobi (weather magnifi-
cent) fifteen good photographs oi the transit (wet collodion and
albumenised glass) were obtained of about 4 inches in size; they
will admit of being combined with the English photographs at
the southern stations. The astronomical observation of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
transit was successfully made by M. De la Croix, who was pro-
vided with a ,6-inch telescope. His observations attest the
existence of an atmosphere round Venus.
Dr. Janssen's third communication related to his magnetic
observations in the Gulf of Siam and the Gulf of Bengal. He
made observations at Bangkok, Bangchallo, Ligor, Singora, and
Singapore, .and concluded that the magnetic equator passes
actually between Ligor and Singora, about 7" 43' N. latitude.
The line without declination passes very near to Singapore. In
the Gulf of Bengal the equator passes through the north of
Ceylon (the precise position will be given). The position of
¦ i.igor has been rectified. It is erroneously placed on the maps

Dr. Janssen had also made some observations which relate to
mirage at sea. He had paid great attention to the phenomena
in all his journeys since 186S, and had observed some very
curious facts relating to mirage chiefly at sunrise and sunset.
He found that (1) the mirage was almost constant at the surface
of the sea; (2) that the appearances were expl.1i.1ed by admitting
the existence of a plane of total reflection at a certain height
above the sea; (3) that the phenomena are due to a thermic and

atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind, currents, weather, sea-
charts, natural history, earthquakes, &c. The diagrams gave
monthly pictures of the Doldrums, showing how in some months
they are wedge-shaped, as the late Commodore Maury remarked.
The whole paper was a rhumtol a work about to be published
by the Meteorological Office.

employed by him and Mr. J. Perry (now professor in Japan) for
determining the form of a hanging drop, and other cases of the

fact that as it was being delivered simultaneously with Prof.
Balfour Stewart's address only a few members of this Section
were able to hear it, Mr. Froude repeated it and the experiments
with which it was accompanied again in Section A on the
Tuesday morning. One experiment in particular was very inte-
resting. A wooden wheel was fixed at a height of about 14 feet,
and an endless chain hanging loosely over the wheel in a loop
drooped to within 4 feet of the ground. When the wheel with

its suspended chain was made to rotate rapidly by means of mul-
tiplying gear, the links of the chain Symbolised the particles of a
running stream ot water. When the chain was struck, while it
was rotating, with a wooden mallet, the curved forms into which
it was thus beaten were to some extent persistent, as if it
v:cre a stiff, fixed wire rope, instead uf being a loose chain in
motion. Mr. Froude said that this experiment illustrated how
water in flowing through pipes did not tend to push them
straight, but rather adapted its motions to their curvatures.
In a letter from Mr. Meldrum, of Mauritius Observatory,
written to accompany foity-nine tables (which, however, had
not arrived), he expressed an opinion that the evidence adduced
in favour of a rainfall periodicity was so strong that he believed
we should by and by be able to predict the general character of
the seasons.

netism' Function of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt, and On Magnetic
Distribution; and Mr. A. Malloch explained a method he had
found accurate and convenient for producing a sharp meridian
shadow.
On the whole, the physical papers read before the Section were
not equal to the average of recent years, either in number or
importance ; but, as a compensation, the number of mathematical
papers was unprecedented, and the Bristol meeting will be

ance of mathematicians. On the Saturday, which has by custom
long been set apart for mathematics, no less than twenty-four
papers (including the three reports noticed in another column)
on pure mathematics were read. Prof. Cayley explained the
theory of the analytical functions which he had termed factions.
Sir \V. Thomson had three papers all relating to the mathe-
matical treatment of the differential equations that occur
in Laplace's theory of the tides. Prof. H. J. S. Smith
explained the effect of the quadric transformation on the
singular points of a curve, showing how singularities lying
upon one side of the triangle of reference became trans-
formed into singularities of a higher order at the opposite
angle; and in another paper of great interest he pointed out
the connection between continued fractions and points in a
line (for exam pie, between 24 expressed as a continued fraction,

Prof. Hubert's very interesting communication on Undulations
in the chalk of the North of France had special refeience to
the strata likely to be encountered in the drift-way of the
Channel Tunnel. The Professor considered that observations of
dips established the existence of two series of folds, one trans-
verse to the other, which by their intersection produce bosses, or
geological hills. The lower rocks, and notably the Greensand,
may thus come to the surface in the Channel, and admit the sea-
water through their porous substance. Sir John Hawkshaw was
present, and combated the geological difficulties with great suc-
cess. A course of no fewer than five hundred borings, made by
a plunger from the side of a vessel, had satisfied him of the
substantial accuracy of the geological map ol the Straits con-
structed from shore observations, and the information yielded by
these borings was in his opinion adequate to prove that the
tunnel will run through Lower Chalk in its whole extent. A
small irregularity, bringing in some less compact rock, may be
successfully and easily encountered by the engineer. In answer
to a suggestion that the shallow holes made by the plunger
might be deceptive, owing to a superficial detritus along the
floor of the Straits, Sir John Hawkshaw explained that the
strong wash of the Channel produced a perfectly clean floor.
All along the Straits the instrument had brought up chalk where
chalk was expected, and gault where gault was expected, and

A paper by Mr. Sanders described some large bones from the
Rhsetic beds of Aust Cliff. The dimensions of these fragments
are so great as to suggest a large Dinosaurian, but the absence of
any medullary cavity seems to imply that the body was habitu-
ally submerged. The articular ends, which might be expected
to yield uselul characters, are not preserved. A communication
from Mr. Brodie opened the question of the extent and classifi-
cation of the Rhietic beds. The interesting discovery of these
deposits at Leicester formed the chief and most novel feature of
the discussion. Confident statement was on the whole more
conspicuous than matured reasoning in this part of the proceed-
ings of the Section, and much evidently remains to be done to
elucidate the pa'oeontological and physical relations of the de-
posits in question- For the moment the preponderance, at least

hardly be over-estimated. As regards the birds of Central
America, it is much to be regretted that we have at present no
oae authority to refer to. The collection of Messrs. Salvin and

region, and together with those of my owu collection, wherein
are the types of the species described in my own papers, would
ai'ford abundant materials for such a task. Mr. Salvin and I
luve often formed plans for a joint work on this subject, and I
i rust we may before long sec our way to its accomplishment.
A similar memoir on the Mammals of Central America is like-
wise of pressing necessity for the better understanding of the
Xeolropical Mammal Fauna. There are considerable materials
Available for this purpose in the collections of Salvin and Arce
in the British Museum, and I trust that some naturalist may
shortly be induced to take np this subject.
2. THE ANDEAN OR COLUMBIAN SUB-REGION.
Of this extensive sub-region, which traverses six or seven
different States, there is likewise no one zoological account;
i .it 1 may mention some of the principal works lately issued
that bear upon the subject. Lcotaud's "Birds of Trinidad"
tives us an account of the ornithology of that island, which
forms a kind of appendage to this sub-region, and Dr. Finsch
i.as more recently published a supplementary notice of them.
Of Venezuela, Columbia, and Ecuador there are only scattered
memoirs in various periodicals on the numerous collections
that have of late years been made in those countries to be
referred to. Several excellent collectors are now, or lately have

Venezuela, Mr. Salmon in Antioquia, Professor Jameson and
Mr. Fraser in Ecuador, whose labours have vastly added to
our knowledge of the zoology of these districts. When
we come to Peru, we have Tschudi's '' Fauna Peruana" to
refer to, which, though unsatisfactory in execution, contains
much of value. How far from being exhausted is the rich
fauna of the Peruvian Andes, is sufficiently manifest from the
wonderful discoveries lately made by Jelski in the district east
of Lima, which was in lact that principally investigated by
Tschudi. Of these, M. Taczanowski has lately given an
;u count as regards the birds in the Zoological Society's " Pro-
ceedings"; and Dr. Peters has published several notices
of the more remarkable Mammals and Reptiles.
Further south, in Bolivia, our leading authority is still the
zoological portion of D'Orbigny'i "Voyage dans 1'Amerique
Mcridionale." This rich and most interesting dist'ict has, it is
line, been visited by several collectors since D'Orbigny's time;
but the results of their joumeyshaye never been published in acon-
ii^ctcd form, though many of their novelties have been described.
Bolivia, I do not doubt, still contains many new and extraordi-

of the public museum of that city,'has lately devoted himself to
the study of the extinct Mammal-fauna, and specially to that of the
Glyptodont Armadillos, of which he has lately completed a splen-
didly illustrated monograph. He has likewise been the chief
adviser of the Government in their plans for recognising the
University of Cordova, which will ultimately no doubt do much
for the cause of natural science in the Argentine Republic Mr.
W. H. Hudson, of Buenos Ayres, has long studied the birds
and other animals of that country, and deserves honourable men-
tion in a country where so few of the native-born citizens pursue
science. His bird-collections have been worked out by Mr.
Salvin and myself, and Mr. Hudson has likewise published
a series of interesting notices on the habits of the species.
The "Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle" contains much
information concerning the animals of La Plata, Patagonia,
and Chili. The "Mammals " by Waterhouse, the "Birds" by
Gould and G. R. Gray, the '' Fishes" by Jenyns, and the
"Reptiles" by Bell, illustrated with notes and observations of
Mr. Darwin, will ever remain among the leading authorities on
the animals of this part of America. On the Rio Negro of
Patagonia, where Mr. Darwin made considerable collections,

we have a more recent authority in Mr. W. H. Hudson, whose
series of birds from this district was examined by myself in
1872.
Dr. R. O. Cunningham has recently followed on the footsteps
of Mr. Darwin in Patagonia, and besides his journal of travels
has published notes [on the animals met with, in the Linnean
Society's Transactions. Mr. Salvin and I have given an
account of his ornithological collections in several papers in
the "Ibis."
As regards the Falkland Islands, two excellent collectors and
observers have of late years been stationed there, and have
provided the means of our becoming well acquainted with the
native birds. Capt. Packe's collections have been examined by
Mr. Gould and myself, and Capt. Abbott's by myself in a
paper to which he has added many valuable notes.
Lastly, as regards Chili, we have Gay's somewhat pretentious
"Fauna Chileria," forming the zoological portion of his
"Historia Fisica y Politica de Chile." The volume on the
Mammals and Birds was compiled at Paris by Desmurs, and
that on the Reptiles and Fishes by Guichenot, but they are not
very reliable. The naturalists of the National Museum of
Santiago, Philippi and Landbeck. have of late years published
in Wiegman's "Archiv" many memoirs on the zoology of the
Chilian Republic, of which I have given a list in a paper on the
Birds of Chili in the Zoological Society's "Proceedings" for
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
1867. More recently Messrs. Philippi and Landbeck have
published a catalogue of Chilian birds in the "Anales de la
Universidad de Chile." But Mr. E. C. Reed, F.Z.S., who
is likewise attached to ,the museum of Santiago, writes me
word that he is now engaged in preparing for publication a com-
plete revision of the Vertebrates of the Republic, which will no
doubt give us still better information on this subject.
6. Galapagos.
Until recently our knowledge of the very singular fauna of
the Galapagos was mainy based upon Mr. Darwin's researches,
as published in the "Zoology of the Beadle," above referred to.
Recently, however, Mr. Salvin and I have described some new
species of birds from these islands from Dr. Habel's collection,
and Prof. Sundevall has published an account of the birds
collected there during the voyage of the Swedish frigate
Euglnic in 1852. Mr. Salvin has likewise prepared and
read before the Zoological Society a complete memoir on the
Ornithology of the Galapagoan Archipelago, which will shortly
be printed in the Society s "Transactions. Much interest has
likewise been recently manifested concerning the gigantic Tor-
toises of the Galapagos, which, Dr. Giinther has reason to believe,

It is remarkable that no one has yet been found to attack this
interesting subject, which might easily be performed by excursions
during the winter months of a few succeeding years.
As regards the ornithology of these islands, the subjoined
summary of what we really know and do not know is mainly
taken from a paper on the Biids of St. Lucia, which I read before
the Zoological Society of London in 1871.
I. 'Ihe Virgin Islands.—Of these islands we may, I think,
assume that we have a fair acquaintance with the birds of St.
Thomas, the most frequently visited of the group, and the halt-
ing place of the West Indian mail steamers. Mr. Riise, who
was long resident here, collected and forwarded to Europe many
specimens, some of iwhich were described by myself,* and
others are spoken of by Prof. Newton in a letter published
in the " Ibis" for 1860, p. 307. Mr. Riise's series of skins
is now, I believe, at Copenhagen. Frequent allusions to the
birds of Sr. Thomas are also made by Messrs. Newton in their
memoir of the birds of St. Croix, mentioned below. In the
"Proceedings" of the Academy of Natural Sciencesof Philadelphia
for 1860, Mr. Cassin has given an account of a collection
of birds made in St. Thomas by Mr. Robert Swift, and presented

to the Academy; twenty-seven species are enumerated.
Quite at the extreme east of the Virgin Islands, and lying
between them and the St. Bartholomew group, is the little
islet of Sombrero, "a naked rock about seven-eighths of a mile
long, twenty to forty feet above the level of the sea, and from a
few rods to about one-third of a mile in width." Although
"there is no vegetation whatever in the island over two feet
high," and it would seem a most unlikely place for birds,
Mr. A. A. Julien, a correspondent of Mr. Lawrence of New
York, succeeded in collecting on it specimens of no less than
thirty-five species, the names of which, together with Mr. Julien's
notes thereupon, are recorded by Mr. Lawrence in the eighth
volume of the "Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of
New York."
The remaining islands of the Virgin group are, I believe, most
strictly entitled to their name so far as ornithology is concerned,
for no collector on record has ever polluted their virgin soil.
Prof. Newton ("Ibis," 1860, p. 307) just alludes to some birds
from St. John in the possession ot Mr. Riise.
2. St. Croix.—On the birds of this island we have an excellent
article by Messrs. A. and E. Newton, published in the first
volume of the "Ibis."t This memoir, being founded on the
collections and personal observations of the distinguished
authors themselves, and having been worked up after a careful
examination of their specimens in England, and with minute

complete account we possess oi the ornithology of any one of the
Lesser Antilles. It, however, of course requires to be supple-
mented by additional observations, many points having been
necessarily left undetermined; and it is much to be regretted
that no one seems to have since paid the slightest attention to
the subject.
3. Anguilla, St. Martin, and St. Bartholomew.—Of this
group of islands St. Bartholomew alone has, as far as I know,
been explored omithologically, and that within a very recent
period. In the Royal Swedish Academy's "Proceedings " for
1869 will be found an excellent article by the veteran
ornithologist Prot. Sunde>pll, on the birds of this island, founded
on a collection made by Dr. A. Von Goes. The species
enumerated are forty-seven in number.
4. Barbuda.—Of this British island I believe I am correct in
saying that nothing whatever is known of its ornithology, or of
any other branch o( its natural history.
5. St. Christopher and Nevis, to which may be added the adjacent
smaller islands .Si. Eustalhius and Saba.—Of these islands also

That we know more of the fauna of Australia than of other
English colonies in different parts of the world is certain, but
no thanks are due from us for this knowledge either to the
Imperial or to any of the Colonial Governments. The unassisted
enterprise of a private individual has produced the two splendid
works upon the Mammals and Birds of Australia, which we all
turn to with pleasure whenever reference is required to a member
of these two classes of Australian animals. Mr. Gould's
"Mammals of Australia" was completed in 1863. Since
that period the little additional information received respecting
the terrestrial Mammals of Australia has been chiefly furnished
by Mr. Kreflt, of the Australian Museum, Sydney, in various
papers and memoirs. Mr. Krefft has also written the letterpress
to some large illustrations of the " Mammals of Australia," by
Miss H. Scott and Mrs. H. Forde, in which a short account of
all the described species is given. On the Marine Mammals,
however, which were scarcely touched upon by'Mr. Gould, we
have a treatise by Mr. A. W. Scott published at Sydney in
1873, which contains a good deal of useful information con-
cerning the seals and whales of the Southern Hemisphere.
The magnificent series of seven volumes of Mr. Gould's
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
"Birds of Australia" was finished in 1848. In 1869 a supple-
mentary volume was issued, containing similar full-sized illus-
trations of about 80 species. In 1863 Mr. Gould reprinted
in a quarto form, with additions and corrections, the letterpress
of his great work, and published it under the title of a "Hand-
book to the Birds of Australia." This makes a convenient work
for general reference. Of two colonial attempts to rival Mr.
Gould's series I cannot speak with much praise. Neither Mr.
Diggle's " Ornithology of Australia " nor Mr. Halley's proposed
"Monograph of the Australian Parrots" are far advanced
towards conclusion—indeed, of the last-mentioned work I have
seen but one number.
Several large collections of birds have been made in the
peninsula of Cape York and adjoining districts of Northern
Queensland of late years, and it is a misfortune for science that
we have had no complete account of them. One of the largest
of these, however, made by Mr. J. T. Cockerell, has luckily
fallen into the hands of Messrs. Salvin and Godman, and will,
I trust, be turned to better uses than the filling of glass cases
and the ornamentation of ladies' hats.
It seems to me that there is still much to be done even in
birds in Northern Australia, and I cannot help thinking that
Port Darwin, the northern extremity of the trans-continental
telegraph, would be an excellent station for a collecting naturalist,
and one where many novelties, both zoological and botanical,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
would certainly be met with.
On the Snakes of Australia we have an excellent work
published in 1869 by Mr. Gerard Krefft—one of the few
really working Australian naturalists, who, it appears, is not
appreciated in Sydney as he fully deserves to be. Mr. Kreflt,
during his long residence in Sydney, has become well acquainted
with the Ophidians of the colony and has devoted special at-
tention to them, so that he has the advantage of practical as well
as scientific acquaintance with his subject. The late Dr. Gray
has written many papers on the Tortoises and Lizards of
Australia; Of the latter we have to thank Dr. Giinther for a
complete monographic list just published in one of the newly
issued numbers of the "Voyage of the Erelms and Terror."
Most of the plates of this work were also issued in 1867 by Dr.
Gray in his "Fasciculus of the Lizards of Australia and New
Zealand."
For information on the fishes of Australia reference must be
made to the ichthyological portion of the " Zoology of the Erebus
and Terror," by Sir John Richardson, and to the same author's
numerous papers on Australian fishes in the "Annals of Nat
Hist." and "Transactions" and "Proceedings" of the Zoo-

VII.—PACIFIC REGION.
Of this region, where Mammals (except a few bats) |are alto-
gether absent, and birds are the predominant form of verte-
brate life, I will say a few final words under three heads :—
I. New Zealand. 2. Polynesia. '3. The Sandwich Islands.
1. New Zealand.
In New Zealand, of all our Colonies, most attention has lately
been devoted to natural history, and several excellent naturalists
are labouring hard and well—I need only mention the names of
Dr. Hector, Dr. Haast, Capt. F. W. Hutton, and Dr. Buller.
The commendable plan of affiliating the various local societies
together to one institute has resulted in the production of an
excellent scientific journal, already in its sixth volume, which
contains a mass of most interesting papers on the fauna and flora
of the colony. To refer to these memoirs in detail is quite
unnecessary ; but it is obvious, on turning over the pages of the
volumes of the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute, how
great are the exertions now being made to perfect our knowledge

uf the natural products, both recent and extinct, of our anti-
podean colony.
Dr. W. L.- Buller's beautiful volume on the ornithology of
New Zealand, finished in 1^73, is likewise a most creditable
production both to the author and to those who have supported
and promoted his undertaking. Few, indeed, arc the colonies
that can boast of a similar piece of work!
In 1843 the late Sir John Richardson presented to this associa-
tion a special report on the Ichthyology of New Zealand;
but much advance has, of course, been made since that period.
The lizards of New Zealand have been recently enumerated
along with those of Australia in Dr. Giinther's memoir above
referred to.
2. POLYNESIA.
Great additions have recently been made to our knowledge of
the natural production* of the Polynesian Islands by the travellers
and naturalists employed by the brothers Godetfroy of Ham-
burgh. These gentlemen not only have extensive collections
made, but also trouble themselves to get them properly worked
out. The excellent volume on the ornithology of the Fiji, Samoa,
and Tonga Islands, published in 1867 by Drs. Finsch and Hart-
laub, is based entirely upon materials thus obtained, as are
likewise the many capital memoirs which fill the parts of
the illustrated quarto Journal der Museum Godefj'roy—a
journal replete with information upon the geography, ethno-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
graphy, and natural history of Polynesia. Amongst these
memoirs I must call special attention to Dr. Giinther's "Fische
der Sudsee," founded upon Mr. Andrew Garrett's splendid
collection of fishes and of drawings of them, coloured from life,
of which three parts are already issued. We have now almost
for the first time the after opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the exceeding beauty of the tropical fishes in life.
The late Mr. Julius Brenchley's account of his cruise in II.M.S.
Ctinifoa among the South Sea Islands, and published in
1873, contains an appendix of " Natural History Notices," illus-
trated by figures of remarkable specimens obtained on the occa-
sion. Of these the part relating to the birds is by the late Mr.
G. R. Gray, and those concerning the reptiles and fishes by Dr.
Gunther.
3. THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
The Sandwich Islands stand apart zoologically as geographi-
cally from the rest of Polynesia, and merit more special attention
than has yet been bestowed upon them. Of their birds, which
form the most prominent part of their vertebrate fauna, Mr.
Dole has given a synopsis in the " Proceedings of the Boston
Society of Natural History." In noticing this paper in the

dozens, all going on in exactly the same way as their predecessors,
each trying to find out the same facts for himself; so that they
were almost at a standstill, especially on the subject of the
migration of bird?. Observers were content not to do anything
more than had been done by Gilbert White, forgetting that he
had had to prove or disprove the fact of migration, about which
there was no question now. We wanted to know something of
the causes of migration and of the faculties by which it was
performed. Hundreds of records of dates of arrival of birds
would bring us no nearer to these discoveries. He thought a
digestion and collation of the immense mass of facts on these
subjects already existing in Great Britain was wanted, such as
had already been prepared for Germany; but one thing that
would not come of it, he was persuaded, was an answer to the
questions he had indicated. There was great want of information
as to the routes taken in migration, and also as to the facts of
partial migration, He thought they must look in this direction
for the solution of the larger question. It would be very
enlightening if they could know something of the reasons which
induced the migration of the majority of individuals of a species,
leaving some behind. It had been suggested by Dr. von Mitten-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:49 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
dorff that probably birds in their migrations were guided by a
knowledge of the situation of the magnetic pole; and however
much they might disbelieve that, they had really no facts which
could controvert that or any other wild theory on the subject.
As to birds learning the way by experience, and by the teaching
of those who had traversed the route before, that would not
explain migrations which took place by night, or over a thousand
miles of sea. The laws of plumage and of moulting were little
known, and might with advantage be studied by those who
had constant access to zoological gardens, such as those at
Clifton. The duration of the periods of incubation of birds was
almost unknown, as well as the reasons for the variations.
Nothing was known for certain as to the effect of variations of
atmospheric temperature or other conditions in shortening or
lengthening the period. Out of more than 200 species of British
birds, the duration of incubation was known in only about
twenty; and of foreign birds even less was known. lie could
mention other branches in which knowledge was deficient, but
perhaps what he had said would be sufficient to induce some of
those who had not adopted any special branch of study to pro-
lecute some of the inquiries he had recommended. The good
workers at present labouring were fully occupied with important
subjects. He could not expect that they would be able to divert
their attention from their chosen departments.—In the discussion
which followed, Canon Tristram remarked on the ease with
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which many who go abroad for the winter or summer might
make valuable records of the time of arrival or the latest time of
seeing migratory birds. Mr. Elwes urged on country clergymen
the valuable service they might easily render by taking ornitho-
logy as a recreation ; much was lacking in regard to osteology
»nd nidification; skins were too much attended to. Mr.
3ettany urged the study of Mr. Parker's papers on all orni-
thologists who could make themselves capable of compre-
hending them, in order to prepare the way lor a better under-
standing of trie genetic affinities of birds in the future; and also
mentioned the service that might be done to such men as Mr.
Parker by any naturalist who would collect a series of specimens
from the earliest to the adult stage of any single species, and
preserve them for study by such an authority.
On the reading of the report on the Zoological Station at
Naples, which we have abstracted elsewhere, Mr. Spence Bate
said it was greatly to be desired that such schools of study should
be established in Great Britain. He did not think they should
have to go to Naples for one. They should be attached to the
various aquariums now being established.

elements of which it is composed ; and principally by the recog-
nition of the secondary nature of cell-walls, the close connection
or even continuity of the nerves with other textures, and the
identity of the white corpuscles of the blood with amoeboid or
uncliffercntiated corpuscles outside the vessels. The origin of
every living corpuscle from corpuscles pre-existing is no longer
difficult to imagine, but may, I incline to think, be almost
looked on as proved. The history of each may be traced back
through conjugated germs to the corpuscles of preceding genera-
tions in uninterrupted succession, and the pedigree of the
structural elements is seen to differ in no way from that of
individual plants or animals. It is true, indeed, that no abso-
lute proof exists that new living corpuscles originating by mere
deposit are not added to the others; but the evidence against such
a thing taking place is exactly of the same description as that
which exists against spontaneous generation of independent
organisms, namely, that things previously unexplained by the
theory of parentage are explained now, while, on the other
hand, there is no sufficient evidence of the origin of life by any
other mode.

disposed to indulge a gratulatory vein. No doubt within the
last dozen years we have had work to be grateful for. Worthy
of a prominent place in this, as in other.departmcnts of anatomy,
is the encyclopaedic work, the "Le9ons," of Milne-Edwatds,
invaluable as a treasury of reference to all future observers;
while the memoirs of Gegenbaur on the carpus, on the shoulder-
girdle, and on the skulls of Selachian fishes, and Kitchen
Parker's memoirs devoted to mature forms, may be taken as
examples that morphological problems suggested by adult com-
parative anatomy have not lost their attraction to men capable
of elaborate original research. And I the more willingly select
the names of these two writers, because on one subject on which
they have written, the shoulder-girdle, I am compelled to differ
from their conclusions and to adhere rather to those of Owen,
so far as the determination of the different elements in fishes is
concerned; and by stating this (although the subject cannot be
now discussed) I am enabled to illustrate that the appreciation
of the value of elaborate and painstaking work is a matter
totally distinct from agreement with the conclusions which may
be arrived at in the investigation of complicated problems,
although wisdom and penetration as to these must ever command
admiration.
But when one looks back on the times of Meckel and Cuvier,
and on the activity inspired by the speculations of the much-
abused Oken, the writings of Geoffrey St.-Hilaire, the less

abstrusely speculative part of the works of G. C. Cams, and
the careful monographs of many minor writers; when one re-
flects on the splendid giasp of Johannes Miiller, and thinks of
the healthy enthusiasm created in this country for a number of
years by Owen's "Archetype and Ilomologies of the Vertebrate
Skeleton," and then contemplates the state of vertebrate mor-
phology at the present moment, it seems to me that its homolo-
gical problems and questions of theoretical interest do not
attract so much attention as they did, or as they deserve.
The Origin of Species by Natural Selection.
There can be no doubt that a great and curious influence has
been exercised on morphology by the rise of the doctrine of
the origin of species by natural selection. Attention has been
thereby directed strongly for a number of years to varieties,
and probably it is to this doctrine that we owe the larger
number of observations niaile 0:1 variations of muscles, nerves,
and other structures. Particularly elaborate have been the
records of muscular variations, very praiseworthy, interesting to
the recorders, very dry to most other people, and hitherto, so
fir as I know, barren enough of any general conclusions. So
much the mote credit is due to those who have worked steadily

are the most irregular structures imaginable. Even in the
sacrum and in the rest of the column the amount of variation
finds no parallel in other animals. In the skull, except in some
of the lowest forms of humanity, the dorsum sella is a ragged,
warty, deformed, and irregular structure, and it never exhibits
the elegance and finish seen in other animals. The curvature of
llie skull and shortening of its base, which have gradually

other examples of similar phenomena will occur.

writings of three eminent anatomists—Professors Owen, Goodsir,
and Huxley.
Changes of Opinion on Morphological Subjects.
For the first time in English literature the great problems of
this description were dealt with in Prof. Owen's work already
referred to, published in 1848; and it is unnecessary to say that,
notwithstanding the presence of unquestionable errors ot theory,
that work was a most valuable and important contribution to
science. The faults in its general scope were justly and quietly
corrected by Goodsir at the meeting of this Association in 1856
in three papers, one of them highly elaborate ; and in these he
showed that the morphology of vertebrate animals could not be
correctly studied while reference was made exclusively to the
skeleton. He showed the necessity of attending to all the
evidence in trying to exhibit the underlying laws of structure,
and especially of having constant regard to the teachings of
embryology. Among the matters of detail which he set right it
may be mentioned that he exposed the untenability of Prof.
Owen's theory of the connection of the shoulder-girdle with the
occipital bone, and pointed out that the limbs were not appen-
dages of single segments corresponding with individual vertebra?.
Referring to the development of the hand and foot, he showed
the importance of observing the plane in which they first appear,
and that the thumb and great toe are originally turned towards
the head, the little finger and little toe toward the caudal end of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the vertebral column. But he probably went too far in trying to
make out an exact correspondence of individual digits with
individual vertebral segments, failing to appreciate that the
segmentation originally so distinct in the primordial vertebra;
becomes altered as the surface of the body is approached—a
truth illustrated in the vertebral columns of the plagiostomatous
fishes, in the muscle-segments over the head in the p euronectids,
and in the interspinal bones bearing the dorsal and anal fin-rays
of numbers of fishes, but, so far as I know, not hitherto sufficiently
appreciated by any anatomist.
In 1858 Prof. Huxley delivered his Croonian Lecture on
the vertebrate skull, and in 1863 his lectures at the Royal College
of Surgeons on the same subject. He profited by tlie wisdom
of Goodsir, and studied the works of Kathke, Keicheit, and
other cmbryologists. But, rightly or wrongly, he took a step
further tt>an Goodsir. He assumed from the Hist that the homo-
logies of adult structures could be determined by development,
and that by that study alone could they be finally demonstrated.
As regards the skull, the constitution of which always remains
the central study of the vertebrate skeleton, his writings marked
the introduction of a period of revulsion against not only the

those who have objected to speaking of cranial vertebrae have
put great importance on the point at which the chorda dorsalis
terminates, although it has been long known that in one animal
the chorda dorsalis runs right on to the front, that in others it
fails to enter the skull at all, while in the majority it passes for
a ceitain distance into the base. Johannes Miiller, on such
grounds, concluded thirty years ago that the presence of chorda
dorsalis was not necessary to constitute a cranial vertebra; and
there seems no reason lo doubt that he was right. Looking at
the early embryo, the cerebro-spinal axis is seen to be one
continuous structure; and the walls of the canal containing it
are likewise manifestly continuous, not at first distinguishable
into a spinal and a cranial portion. Looking at the adult
condition, in the higher classes the vertebrse of the tail are seen
dwindling into mere bodies developed round the chorda,
and giving off rudimentary processes without separate centres of
ossification, while towards the head the bodies diminish and the
arches enlarge; and in the skull the chorda, round which the
bodies in the rest of the column are developed, comes to an end,
and the neural arches are enormously enlarged and have
additional centres of ossification, precisely as in the mammalian

thorax costal centres of ossification are found which do not exist
in the costal elements of cervical vertebrae. It would therefore
be quite as justifiable to object to the term vertebra as applied to
a joint of the tail because it has no lamina, or none with
separate centres of ossification, as to object to its applicability to
segments of the skull because the chorda is absent, or the osseous
elements different in number from those found usually in the
segments of the trunk.
However, it is gratifying to observe that among the most
recent additions to morphological anatomy there is a highly
suggestive paper by Prof. Huxley, appearing in the Royal
Society's " Proceedings" for December last, and entitled "Pre-
liminary Notes upon the Brain, and Skull ofArnfhioxus lancco-
lalus," in which the learned Professor, who has for many years
been the most determined opponent to the mention of cranial
vertebne, declares, so far as I can apprehend his meaning, that
the region of the head represents no less than fourteen segments,
all of which he terms prolovcrtcbrtz in Amphioxus. This deter-
mination of correspondences is made the more remarkable by
being followed up with a suggestion that the numerous proto-
vertebrje lying in front of the fourteenth in Amphioxus are repre-
sented only by muscles and nerves in the higher vertebrates.
I hail this paper as being practically at last an ample acknow-
ledgment that there is no escape from admitting the correspon-
dence of the region of the head with the segments of the trunk:

but the details of the new theory scarcely seem convincing ; and
I might have preferred to leave its discussion to others, were it
not that the notions which it opens up are far too important to
allow it to be passed over in any account of the present state of
opinion on the subject of vertebrate morphology. The argument
in this new theory runs thus: that the palate-curtain olAmfAiexus
is homologous with that of the lamprey, and that the palate-
curtain of the lamprey is attached below the ear; that therefore
all the seven segments seen in front of the palate-curtain of
Amphioxus are represented by parts in front of the ear in the
lamprey and the other Vertebrata. Again, the branchial arches
of the higher Vertebrata are assumed to be of the nature of ribs,
and in none of the Vertebrala next above Amphioxus "are there
more than seven pairs of branchial arches, so that not more than
eight myotomes (and consequently protovertebiic) of Amphioxus,
in addition to those already mentioned, can be reckoned as the
equivalents of the paiachordal region of the skull in the higher
vertebrates." Everything, observe, depends on the segment to
which the palate-curtain of Amphioxus belongs. Now I have
already pointed out to you that the segmentation of the vertebrate
body is not peifect ; and there is no method by which the alimen-

by a new and simple process, devised by Mr. Hugh Bowman, of
Newcastle. The apparatus was also shown and described. It

angle of 45 degrees in front of the eye-piece of the microscope,
and directed downwards. The image was received upon a
collodion plate set in the frame of a common photographic
camera, and the photograph taken in the usual way. About 11
seconds was stated to be a sufficient exposure for the purpose.

to refer to Dr. Frichard as a Bristol man, and because he had
been mainly instrumental in directing his course at the outset
of his public life; by his advice he had read his first paper
before the British Association at its former visit to Bristol. His
thoughts were those of a physiologist among physiologists,
and a scholar among scholars, but he was resolved to keep
the threads together if possible. He was perhaps the first
to bring a large idea of species to bear upon the origin of
man, and to trace out intermediate links and gradational cha-
racters, and to investigate the analogous features in the history of
domesticated animals. With regard to the antiquity of man,
he believed that Prichard was the first to propound the doctrine,
now so generally accepted, of the much greater antiquity of man
than could be supposed if the genealogies of Genesis were accu-
rate. He made a careful and scientific investigation of those
genealogies, and found it absolutely necessary to conclude that
they could not be relied upon for chronological evidence; and
when he further came to consider the amount of time necessary
to produce such strongly marked races as the Jewish and the
Egyptian, on the hypothesis of the unity of the race and the
time which would be required to produce such divarications of
language as existed in the early historical period, he was addi-
tionally supported in his view as to the antiquity of the human
race.
Col. Lane Fox gave a most interesting account of recent exca-

vations in Cissbury Camp, near Worthing, of which full details
will be published at the earliest possible time. He said that the
entrenchment was one of the largest in the south of England,
and had all the peculiarities of a British earthwork. Camden
spoke of this camp as the work of Cissa, the Saxon king of the
district, from whom, in his opinion and in great probability,
it derived its name of Cissbury. He believed the first notice of
the place as a flint factory was by himself in 1868, when, finding
a large quantity of flint flakes on the surface and a number of
large pits which filled the interior of the camp on the west side,
he dug into some of them to a depth of four or five feet, and found
in them a still further number of flakes, together with finished
and unfinished flint tools. It was evident that here was a flint
factory, and that it was established because of the much greater
ease of working the flints when first removed from the chalk.
He had no idea then of the great extent of the mining operations
of these chalk people, nor did he think it necessary to dig deeper,
some of the pits as left open, and further opened by himself,
being twenty feet deep. They appeared to be quite deep enough
for a sufficient quantity of flints to be got. The true nature of
these flint works was illuminated by accident, viz., by the cutting

plainly roughened at the broad end so as to be held in the hand.
He thought at any rate that these flints were of a very early Neo-
lithic period, and showed considerable traces of the Paleolithic,
though there might yet remain a gap between the periods. The
shafts had been kept open, and would still be open for another
fortnight, when, by agreement with the owner, they were to be
closed up. Many of the leading authorities in this department
had visited the place, but subsequently the only actual plan of
the workings would be the wooden model which he exhibited,
showing all the strata, shafts, and galleries.
Prof. Rolleston then proceeded to speak of the animal re-
mains. He said the snail and other shells found were of great
use, and supplied a cogent argument, without ambiguity, as
cogent as Euclid. Here was the sharp line of the shaft, and at a
depth of fourteen feet from the original surface were found an
immense number of Cyclostoma clegans, Helix nemoralis, and
other hybernating snail shells. They were not brought down to
be eaten by the excavators, as was supposed, but the opercula
were still found exactly in situ, giving evidence that they had gone
down for warmth and shelter while still alive. They had also
found plenty of food in the moist conditions of the shaft. They

had ^undoubtedly gone down the shaft at a time when it was still
open; and further evidence was that no snail shells at all were
to be found in the rubble which had gradually dribbled down.
He thought that the abundance of the shells was to be explained
by the fact that these prehistoric Britons, like our own country-
men of the present day, were a little negligent in putting an end
to nuisances, whether they were open shalts or otherwise, and
thus the shaft had been open a good while, and a large series of
snails had lived here. And among other results of this negli-
gence was, he believed, the fall of a young British lady into the
shaft.TP At any rate her bones had been found in a position quite
compatible with this idea. With the skeleton were found a large
number of pig-bones; there were at least four individuals, one
old and three younger. We have not the entire skeleton of any
one of them, and it was quite compatible with the evidence that
these bones might have been thrown in piecemeal. Other bones
were found, all of domestic animals, especially a small animal
which might be a sheep or a goat; the critical pieces of the
skeleton were absent. As to the Bos primigtnius there was not
the smallest doubt, and it was found in a position which showed
it.to have occurred before the advent of the small domestic ani-
mals; and wild animals of the same kinds must have then been
much larger, or they would speedily have been exterminated by
the wolves. As to the female skeleton, nearly all the bones
were preserved, scarcely three of the vertebra; being missing.

She was evidently between eighteen and twenty-five years of age,
by various indications of the bones. She had a large head, yet
it was an early type of skull, older than that of the people who
built the rampart. The lower jaw contained a large number of
teeth. The wisdom teeth were just through, and were scarcely
worn at all; yet the two molar teeth in front of them on each
side, above and below, were ground down nearly to the stumps.
From this he inferred that the food had been of such a character
as to produce wearing of the teeth. The evidence of the bones
was conclusive as to her youth. The only parallel he could find
to this was in the Indians of Vancouver's Island, who fed on
fish dried in the sand-blowing winds, and their teeth were thus
worn down to the stumps. Similarly these people might have
fed on food dried in the wind, in which a large amount of fine
sand got embedded. The cubical capacity of the cranium was
very large ; as measured by rape-seed it was I05'75 cubic inches;
and the largest cubical capacity he knew of was one of a great
Roman officer out of their burial grounds, whose capacity was
108 cubic inches. The people who made the shafts were un-
doubtedly older than the Britons who made the great rampart,
and they were still in a stone using period.

direct their attention to the general relations existing among all
the forces and phenomena of nature. In some important branches
of such subjects, it is only through study of the local physical
conditions of various parts of the earth's surface and the compli-
cated phenomena to which they give rise, that sound conclusions
can be established ; and this study constitutes physical or scien-
tific geography. It is very necessary to bear in mind that a
large portion of the phenomena dealt with by the sciences of
observation relates to the earth as a whole in contradistinction to
the substances of which it is formed, and can only be correctly
appreciated in connection with the terrestrial or geographical
conditions of the place where they occur. On the one hand,
therefore, while the proper prosecution of the study of physical
geography requires a sound knowledge of the researches and
conclusions of students in the special branches of science, on the
other success is not attainable in the special branches without
suitable apprehension of .geographical facts. For these reasons
it appears to me that the general progress of science will involve
the study of geography in a more scientific spirit, and with a
clearer conception of its true function, which is that of obtaining
accurate notions of the manner in which the forces of nature

have brought about the varied conditions characterising the sur-
face of the planet which we inhabit.
In its broadest sense science is organised knowledge, and its
methods consist of the observation and classification of the
phenomena of which we become conscious through our senses,
and the investigation of the causes of which these are the effects.
The first step in geography, as in all other sciences, is the obser-
vation and description of the phenomena with which it is con-
cerned ; the next is to classify and compare this empirical collec-
tion of facts, and to investigate their antecedent causes. It is
in the first branch of the study that most progress has been
made, and to it indeed the notion of geography is still popularly
limited. The other branch is commonly spoken of as physical
geography, but it is more correctly the science ol geography.
The progress of geography has thus advanced from first rough
ideas of relative distance between neighbouring places, to correct
views of the earth's form, precise determinations of position, and
accurate delineations of the surface. The first impressions of
the differences observed between distant countries were at length
corrected by the perception of similarities no less real. The
characteristics of the great regions of polar cold and equatorial
heat, of the sea and land, of the mountains and plains, were
appreciated ; and the local variations of season and climate, of
wind and rain, were more or less fully ascertained. Later, the
distribution of plants and animals, their occurrence in groups of

peculiar structure in various regions, and the circumstances under
which such groups vary from place to place, gave rise to fresh
conceptions. Along with these facts were observed the pecu-
liarities of the races of men—their physical form, languages,
customs, and history—exhibiting on the one hand striking differ-
ences in different countries, but on the other often connected by
a strong stamp of similarity over large areas.
By the gradual accumulation and classification of such know-
ledge the scientific conception of geographical unity and continuity
was at length formed, and the conclusion established that while
each different part of the earth's surface has its special charac-
teristic;, all animate and inanimate nature constitutes one general
system, and that the particular features of each region are due to
the operation of universal laws acting under varying local condi-
tions. It is upon such a conception that is now brought to bear
the doctrine, very generally accepted by the naturalists of our
own country, that each successive phase of the earth's history,
for an indefinite period ol time, has been derived from that which
preceded it, under the operation of the forces of nature as we
now find them; and that, so far as observation justifies the
adoption of any conclusions on such subjects, no change has ever

radiation; and that the surface cooled and became a solid crust,
leaving a central nucleus of much higher temperature within.
The earth's surface appears now to have reached a temperature
which is virtually fixed, and on which the gain of heat from the
sun is, on the whole, just compensated by the loss by radiation
into surrounding space.
Such a conception of the earliest stage of the earth's existence
is commonly accepted, as in accordance with observed facts. It
leads to the conclusion that the hollows on the surface of the
globe occupied by the ocean, and the great areas of dry land,
were original irregularities of form caused by unequal contrac-
tion; and that the mountains were corrugations, often ac-
companied by ruptures, caused by the strains developed in the
external crust by the force of central attraction exerted during
Cooling, and were not due to forces directly acting upwards
generated in the interior by gases or otherwise. It has recently
been very ably argued by Mr. Mallet that the phenomena of
volcanic heat are likewise consequences of extreme pressures in
the external crust, set up in a similar manner, and are not
derived from the central heated nucleus.

been thus developed sufficient to have produced the gigantic
changes which have occurred in the distribution of land and
water over immense areas, and in the elevation of the bottoms
of former seas so that they now form the summits of the highest
mountains, and to have effected such changes within the very
latest geological epoch. These difficulties in great measure
arise from not employing correct standards of space and time
in relation to the phenomena. Vast though the greatest heights
of our mountains and depths of our seas may be, and enormous
though the masses which have been put into motion, when
viewed according to a human standard, they are insignificant in
relation to the globe as a whole. Such heights and depths
(about six miles) on a sphere of ten feet in diameter would be
represented on a true scale by elevations and depressions of less
than the tenth part of an inch, and the average elevation of the
whole of the dry land (about 1,000 feet) above the mean level of
the surface would hardly amount to the thickness of an ordinary
sheet of paper. The forces developed by the changes of the
temperature of the earth as a whole must be proportionate to its
dimensions; and the results of their action on the surface in
causing elevations, contortions, or disruptions of the strata,
cannot be commensurable with those produced by forces having
the intensities, or by strains in bodies of the dimensions, with
which our ordinary experience is conversant

perhaps less great, the conception being one with which most
persons are now more or less familiar. But I would remind you,
that great though the changes in human affairs have been since
the most remote epochs of which we have records in monuments
or history, there is nothing to indicate that within this period
has occurred any appreciable .modification of the main outlines
of land and sea, or of the condition of climate, or of the
general characters of living creatures; and that the distance
that separates us Irom those days is as nothing when compared
with the remoteness of past geological ages. No useful approach
has yet been made to a numerical estimate of the duration even
of that portion of geological time which is nearest to us; and
we can say little more than that the earth's past history extends
over hundreds of thousands or millions of years.
The solid nucleus of the earth with its atmosphere, as we now
find them, may thus be regarded as exhibiting the residual
phenomena which have resulted on its attaining a condition of
practical equilibrium, the more active process of aggregation
having ceased, and the combination of its elements into the
various solid, liquid, or gaseous matters found on or near the

operation of invariable physical forces.
From these investigations we carry on the inquiry to the living
creatures found upon the earth ; what are their relations one to
another, and what to the inorganic world with which they are
associated?
This inquiry first directed to the present time, and thence
carried backwards as fur as possible into the past, proves that
there is one general system of life, vegetable and animal, which
is coextensive with the earth as it now is, and as it has been in
all the successive stages of which we obtain a knowledge by
geological research. The phenomena of life, as thus ascer-
tained, are included in the organisation of living creatures, and
their distribution in time and place. The common bond that

subsists between all vegetables and animals is testified by the
identity of the ultimate elements of which they are composed.
These elements are carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen,
with a few others in comparatively small quantities; the whole
of the materials of all living things being found among those
that compose the inorganic portion of the earth.
The close relation existing between the least specialised
animals and plants, and between these and organic matter not
having life, and even with inorganic matter, is indicated by the
difficulty that arises in dttermining the nature of the distinctions
between them. Among the more highly developed members of
the two great branches of living creatures, the well-known
similarities of structure observed in the various groups indicate
a connection between proximate iorms which was long seen to
be akin to that derived through descent from a common ancestor
by ordinary generation.
The facts of distribution show that certain forms are associ-
ated in certain areas, and that as we pass from one such area to
another the forms of life change also. The general assemblages
of living creatur.es in neighbouring countries easily accessible to
one another, and having similar climates, resemble one another;
and much in the same way, as the distance between areas
increases, or their mutual accessibility diminishes, or the condi-
tions of climate differ, the likeness of the forms within them
becomes continually less apparent. The plants and animals
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
existing at any time in any locality tend constantly to diffuse
themselves around that local centre, this tendency being con-
trolled by the conditions of climate, &c, of the surrounding
area, so that, under certain unfavourable conditions diffusion
ceases.
The possibilities of life are further seen to be everywhere
directly influenced by all external conditions, such as those of
climate, including temperature, humidity, and wind; of the
length of the seasons and days and nights; of the character of
the surface, whether it be land or water, and whether it be
covered by vegetation or otherwise; of the nature of the soil;
of the presence of other living creatures, and many more. The
abundance of forms of life in different areas (as distinguished
from number of individuals) is also found to vary greatly, and
to be related to the accessibility of such areas to immigration
from without; to the existence, within or near the areas, of
localities offering considerable variations of the conditions that
chiefly affect life; and to the local climate and conditions being
compatible with such immigration.
For the explanation of these and other phenomena of organi-
sation and distribution, the only direct evidence that observation

original constitution of the'matter which was drawn together to
form our planet. The actual character of all inorganic sub-
stances, as of all living creatures, is only consistent with the
actual constitution and proportions of the various substances of
which the earth is composed. Other proportions than the actual
ones in the constituents of the atmosphere would have required
an entirely different organisation in all air-breathing animals, and
probably in all plants. With any considerable difference in the
quantity of water either in the sea or distributed as vapour, vast
changes in the constitution of living creatures must have been
involved. Without oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbon,
what we term life would have been impossible. l!ut such specu-
lations need not be extended.
The substances of which the earth is now composed are
identical with those of which it has always been made up; so
far as is known it has lost nothing and has gained nothing,
except what has been added in extremely minute quantities by
the fall of meteorites. All that is or ever has been upon the
earth is part of the earth, has sprung from the earth, is sustained
by the earth, and returns to the earth ; taking back thither what
it withdrew, making good the materials on which life depends,

without which it would cease, and which are destined again to
enter into new forms, and contribute to the ever onward How of
the great current of existence.
The progress of knowledge has removed all doubt as to the
relation in which the human race stands to this great stream of
life. It is now established that man existed on the earth at a
period vastly anterior to any of which we have records in history
or otherwise. He was the contemporary of many extinct
mammalia at a time when the outlines of laud and sea, and the
conditions of climate over large parts of the earth, were wholly
different from what they now are, and our race has been
advancing towards its present condition during a series of ages
for the extent of which ordinary conceptions of time afford no
suitable measure. These facts have, in recent years, given a
different direction to opinion as to the manner in which the great
groups of mankind have become distributed over the areas where
they are now found ; and difficulties once considered insuperable
become soluble when regarded in connection with those great
alterations of the outlines of land and sea which are shown to
have been going on up to the very latest geological periods. The
ancient monuments ot Egypt, which take us back perhaps 7,000
years from the present time, indicate that when they were erected
the neighbouring countries were in a condition of civilisation not
very greatly diffeient from that which existed when they fell
under the dominion of the Romans or Mahometans hardly 1,500

years ago; and the progress ot the population towards that
condition can hardly be accounted for otherwise than by prolonged
gradual transformations going back to times so far distant as to
require a geological rather than [an historical standard of
reckoning.
Man, in short, takes his place with the rest of the animate
world, in the advancing front of which he occupies so conspicuous
a position. Yet for this position he is indebted not to any exclu-
sive powers of his own, but to the wonderful compelling forces
of nature which have lifted him entirely without his knowledge,
and almost without his participation, so far above the animals'of
whom he is still one, though the only one able to see or consider
what he is.
For the social habits essential to his progress, which he
possessed even in his most primitive state, man is without ques-
tion dependent on his ancestors, as he is for his form and other
physical peculiarities. In his advance to civilisation he was
insensibly forced, by the oressure of external circumstances,
through the more savage condition, in which his life was that of
the hunter, fiist to pastoral and then to agricultural occupations.

canals running into the great canal of the ovule, canals refcired
to by a large number of zoologist?. M. Lortet al-o described
his observations on the very peculiar fauna of the Lake of

M. Merget explained the very interesting results of his
researches on the thermodiffusion of porous and humid pulveru-
lent bodies. A thermo-diffuser is generally a porous vessel,
filled with an inert powder, in the middle of which is a glass
tube or a metallic tube riddled with holes. On healing such an
apparatus, after having moistened it, steam is disengaged in
abundance through the porous substance, while dry air traverses
the apparatus in an inverse direction, and escapes by the tube.
If this escape be prevented, there is produced a pressure which
reached three atmospheres at a dull red heat. If the pulverulent

mass or the porous body ceases to be most, no gas escapes.
The author did nut explain the fact, but he showed that the
explanation of it given by M. De la Rive cannot be accepted.
M. Merget is convinced that there is here a thermo-dynamic
phenomenon. Thermo-diffusion must play an important part
in the gaseous exchanges of vegetable life; the author showed
this by taking a leaf of Nelumbium as a thermo-diffuser.
M. Gripon commuuicated to the Section and repeated various

In receiving upon a Savart polariscope light polarised by a

its previous meetings have surpassed this one in respect
to the number of members present, but none can be
regarded as superior to it in the general excellence of the

falling off in attendance may be briefly mentioned. The
cities of the Atlantic sea-board where local scientific
societies [have been longest in existence, and where a
large proportion of the membership of the Association is
resident, are 750 to 1,000 miles, chiefly eastward, from
Detroit. That city, on the boundary line between the
United States and Canada, is also considerably to the
northward of the larger centres of population in the
Western States. Thus, then, the assembling at Detroit
required, in the great majority of instances, a long,
tedious, and rather expensive journey. It need not be
concealed that, owing to the widespread effects of the
depression in all branches of business in the United
States—extending even to the learned professions—the
pecuniary means of members were in many cases more
restricted than usual; and this fact in many cases
decided adversely the question of attendance at the

meeting.
A protracted series of discussions in that and previous
years resulted at the meeting of 1874 in the Association's
adopting a new constitution, which first displayed its
general effects at Detroit. The two prominent features
of change were modelled upon the system of the British
Association. A division was made between Fellows and
the,rest of the members, prominence or usefulness in
science being required for election to the honours of
Fellowship. This elective process did not, however, apply
to the Fellows who became such between the meetings at
Hartford and Detroit, and consequently many have been
admitted to the dignity who have no claim to it by scien-
tific labours. To the Fellows rather than to the general
membership, the guidance and management of the Asso-
ciation is confided. The effect of this change was very
apparent at Detroit in the exclusion of a large number of
communications which would easily have passed the
ordeal of committees and been read at the meetings of
previous years. The chosen remainder reached a higher
average of excellence than has been hitherto attained, and
in the section of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry,
the weeding process so reduced the number of communi-
cations that the supply gave out before the close of the
meeting; but this may also be accounted for by the fact

that the sub-section of Chemistry, for the first time orga-
nised and separately at work, much facilitated the dis-
patch of business in Section A. A variety of concurrent
causes presented a like result from being reached in
Section B, devoted to Geology and Biology. The geo-
logists are always largely in force when the Association
meets west of the Alleghanies, the development of the
mining resources of the newer States and Territories
rendering their labours of immediate economic interest
and value. There was an extraordinary accession of
ethnological papers, prompted chiefly by numerous dis-
coveries recently made in new and very thorough explo-
rations of Indian mounds. The great injuries which the
food crops of the United States have suffered from insects
within a year or two, called forth several papers of merit
from the leading entomologists, as well as much debate
and some action on the part of the Association. Besides
all the foregoing subjects, there was an unusual number
of papers on specific investigations in natural his-
tory. These were largely the fruit of the seed sown

progress down the several river basins, of ordinary floods, but
more particularly of those great inundations which prove so
disastrous to life and property. He recommends the formation
of Hydrometric Commissions at Bordeaux for the basin of the
Gironde ; at Libourne, for the basin of the Adour; and at Car-
cassonne or Narbonne, for the basin of the Aude. When the
enormous saving to life and property which would have been
effected through such organisations, had they existed, is con-
sidered, during the late deplorable inundation, we cannot for a
moment doubt that Hydrometric Commissions similar to that of
Lyons will at once be organised in the basins of the Garonne and
its affluents.

him was how the old order had changed, "giving place to the

somewhat better than the old. The local authorities and the
leading industrial firms in Manchester and the surrounding dis-

Thames Valley series of remains of British elephants, rhinoceri,
deer, ox, &c, which have been discovered in the Ilford Marshes,
near Stratford, during the last thirty years, and has hitherto
formed the unique private collection of Sir Antonio Brady, of
Stratford-le-Point. The nature and value of this collection, as
now exhibited at the British Museum, will appear from the fol-
lowing facts :—It contains remains of no less than 100 elephants,
all of which have been obtained from Ilford. These are referable
to two species, viz., Elephasprimigenius, the mammoth,*and E.
anliquus, a more southern form. The skeletons of each species
are represented by many fine examples, and the collection of
teeth and jaws represents elephants of every age and size, from
the sucking calf, with milk molars, to the patriarch of the herd,
whose last molars are so worn that they must have become use-
less for grinding his food. One characteristic of the Ilford ele-
phants is the number of the plates in the last molar tooth, which
has never been found to exceed nineteen or twenty, as against
the twenty-four and sometimes twenty-eight in other species.
The largest tooth is ten inches in length. The rhinoceri of the
Thames Valley are represented by eighty-six remains, of three
species, distinguished by the character or the absence of the bony
nasal septum—viz., Rhinoceros megarhinus, R. leptorhinus, and
R. tichorhinus. The British lion, which recent geology shows to
have been no my th, is represented by a lower jaw and a phalanx of
the lelt forefoot. The Brady collection also includes the Thames

The ruminants, such as the stag, bison, and ox, constitute fully
one-half the collection, numbering more than 500 specimens.
They include seven specimens of the great Irish Elk (Megactros
hibernicus) and fifty of the Red Deer.
We learn from the Lancet that the sanitary authorities of

diarrheca in any other large town during any week of the year

the importance in reference to anthropology of the study of

influence of prosperity on populations in determining the max-
ima and minima of births and deaths. Alter speaking with
just pride of the merit due to the Paris Society of having inau-

capable of being used to lift and pull heavy weights. He does
not venture to give an opinion as to the probable antiquity of
these remains, but he believes that no one acquainted with prac-
tical mechanics can attach faith to the commonly accepted
theory that these stones have been conveyed from distances and
elevated to their present positions by slides or rollers. The
speaker, moreover, pointed to the fact that a bronze bracelet of
indisputable Gallic fabrication was found below one of the Lozere
dolmens; and he is of opinion that the men who erected the
latter used iron as well as bronze.—In discussing the human

matter in several papers referring to the so-called Aztecs intro-

reference to the existence of the supernumary cranial bone,

tion that can be practically carried out, or that is not, on
its face, almost a confessed absurdity.
The extracts which we append from evidence on this
question form but a very small portion of the representa-
tions submitted to the Royal Commission, of which they
must be considered only samples.
Prof. Owen :—
"I conceive that the recommendation by Bentham in
the last century of such a minister can hardly fail to be
practically adopted before the close of the present cen-
tury, and that the necessity of having a minister for such
a purpose will be recognised."
Sir W. Thomson :—
"Would you contemplate that a new department of the
State should be constituted for directing the scientific
work of the Government ?—It would be quite necessary
to have a Minister of Science; it is indeed, I think, gene-
rally felt that a Minister of Science and scientific instruc-
tion is a necessity."
"Not a minister of other instructions—Specially of
scientific instruction, and not under any national educa-
tion board, but a minister of science and scientific in-

struction. The minister would necessarily be in Parlia-
ment and a political man, but it would be very rare
that he could also be a scientific man, and perhaps not
desirable that he should be a scientific man, but heonust
have able scientific advisers always at hand." \*^
"Could any such duties be well assigned to any existing
department of the State ?—I believe not."
"You spoke of the necessity for having a Minister of
Science ; do you conceive that it would be requisite to
have a cabinet minister for education and a second cabi-
net minister for science, or would you contemplate that
the minister for education should be the minister for
science ?—I do not wish absolttely to fix it beforehand;
on the whole I think, however, that the title of Minister of
Education would not suffice. If there is to be a minister
it must be a minister of science and education. There

"You stated, did you not, that you thought it desirable
that there should be some permanent official to represent
and advise the Government in its relations to science ?—
Decidedly."
General Strachey :—
"The first conclusion that I arrive at is that all ques-
tions relating to scientific matters that arise in the opera-
tions of the Government should be dealt with by one of
the chief ministers of the Crown, and the officer at the
head of the Education Department seems to be the most
suitable of such officers. It has been, I know, suggested
by some persons that it would be better if there were a
separate department for science. That I venture to
doubt
"Under such an education and science department
there would be a natural division of the duties, which
would probably lead to the appointment of some perma-
nent officer in the position of an under secretary of State,

who would have specific charge of the scientific duties of
the department as distinguished from the educational
duties, which constitute a distinct branch of administra-
tive work
"The principal officers in the proposed scientific
branch of the department should be, by their scientific
qualifications, capable of disposing of the ordinary current
business under their charge"
Dr. Sclater :—
"Do you agree with [Col. Strange's] views as to the
creation of a Minister of Science and a Council of
Science ?—Yes, I agree generally with his views; I
think that it would be very desirable for the interest of
science."
"Do you think it would be desirable that the existing
State scientific institutions should be removed from the
control of the Admiralty, the Office of Works, and other
departments under which they are now placed ?—I think
it would be a very great advantage that they should be
removed from those departments and placed under one
minister."
"Have you any opinion as to whether the work could
be done by a Minister of Education, supposing such a
minister were appointed ?—I think it would hardly be
expected that a minister should be appointed only for

countries that that department is given to the Minister of
Education, I think that we could not follow a better
example here."
Prof. Balfour Stewart:—
"I think it [the Ministry of Science] might form a
division, perhaps, of the Ministry of Education."
Mr. Farrer:—
"I dislike very much the idea of establishing new de-
partments of the Government. If it were possible that
this business could be placed upon the Minister of Educa-
tion, who is becoming more and more important, I think
that would be much better than establishing a separate
department for the purpose."
Sir George Airy is perhaps the only witness of authority
who does not seem able to perceive that any advantages
would follow the creation of a Science Minister. The
following is his evidence on the question :—

"The evidence of three eminent statesmen possessing
great administrative experience—Lord Derby, Lord Salis-
bury, and Sir Stafford Northcote—is in strong contrast
(so far as the proposal to establish a Council of Science
is concerned) with that which we have received from many
persons holding official positions in various branches of
the public service. The opinions of these latter, as to the
inefficiency of the organisation of their respective services
in regard to questions affecting science, we have already
quoted in the first part of this Report, and it will be seen
from the quotations we are now about to give, that they
in general consider the creation of a Council to be the
proper remedy."
The Commissioners preface their extracts from the
evidence laid before them on this subject by saying :—
"We fear that no mere extracts from the evidence of
Col. Strange would represent in an adequate manner the

views which have led him to recommend the formation of
a large and highly-paid Council of Science. It would
scarcely be fair to him, as the most prominent advocate
of the proposed measure, to do otherwise than refer to
his evidence at length, pp. 75 to 92, and 125 to 135, vol.
ii. of Evidence."
When we say that Col. Strange's evidence constitutes
a complete and carefully arranged scheme for the scien-
tific administration of the country, it will|be readily under-
stood why the Commissioners refer^to it as a whole,,rather
than cite detached portions of it from which no concep-
tion of its systematic and comprehensive character could
be formed. With respect to the Council, CoL Strange
first points out its necessity and then defines its functions.
His next step is to so construct it as to fit it for perform-
ing these functions satisfactorily. And finally, he enters
fully into the mode of its election, its remuneration, and
its relation to the Minister of Science and to the various
departments and institutions concerned with] scientific
questions.
Though, like the Commissioners, we find it impossible
to give a just idea of this scheme by means of extracts,
we think that as the composition of the Council suggested
by Col. Strange was made by the' Commission the foun-
dation of their examination of almost every witness who

branches of her Majesty's service ought to be thoroughly
represented. Engineer and Artillery officers and the navy
should be represented both in its navigation department
and in the department of seamanship, and the depart-

amply—the English universities, the Scotch universities,
and the Irish universities. Also practical telegraphy,
which is a very distinct branch of engineering, civil

the Privy Council, or some of the other Government
scientific departments ?—I think it would relieve the
departments from pieces of scientific work at present
given to them, because there is no other body to whom
they can be given, and for which they are by their orga-
nisation and personnel almost necessarily ill fitted and
insufficiently competent."
"You would leave to these departments their adminis-
trative functions, but give them the advantage of con-
sulting with the Council upon higher questions of science
on which they desired information ?—Yes, certainly; every
question of science that falls under the notice of any
department of the Government would naturally be referred
to the scientific Council."
Dr. Frankland ithus deals with Col. Strange's pro-
posal :—
"Are you acquainted with Col. Strange's proposal for
the establishment of a consultative council of science ?—
Yes, I have heard from him some of the chief ideas that
he entertains on that subject."
"Are you disposed to consider that such a Council
would be desirable ?—I think so. I am not prepared to
say that it should be constituted exactly in the way that
Col. Strange mentioned, but a Council of that description

would be exceedingly desirable, on many grounds, for
furnishing the Government with trustworthy scientific
opinions in cases requiring them. ..."
"Are you of opinion that the advice of such a Council,
even on matters to which the larger ptoportion of the
members of the Council had not paid special attention,
would be valuable .'—Yes, I think it would, because those
members of the Council who were thoroughly acquainted
with the subjects would be expressing their opinion to
men conversant with scientific methods, and they would
be able to convince their colleagues with respect to the
opinion that the Council generally ought to give upon the
matter. _ It would be a very different thing from that of
convincing a Parliamentary Committee, for instance, upon
a scientific point, because all the men upon the Council
would have received a scientific training and would under-
stand the bearing of scientific arguments."
"Have you considered at all how such a Council could
best be appointed, whether would you leave it to one of
the Ministers to appoint and select the proper persons to
serve on the Council ?—I should think that it must ulti-

those interested in the subject. The object of the paper
was to show that for high furnaces it was unnecessary to
calcine the limestone before using it.
Mr. W. Hackney read a paper on the designing of
ingot moulds for steel rail ingots. Mr. Hackney has
designed a mould in which the outside is rounded, the
thickness of the metal being so adjusted at different parts
of the circumference that the expansion under heat should
be equal all round. This form has given satisfactory
results, one proof of its correctness being that when it
becomes heated to redness by an ingot of steel cast in it,
the temperature of the outside is apparently equal all
round.
Mr. Charles Wood described some improvements made
by him in the hearths of blast furnaces. Another paper
by Mr. Lowthian Bell described Mr. W. Price's retort
furnace. In Mr. Price's furnace the temperature of the
air, as well as that of the gaseous and fixed constituents
of the coal, is raised by the waste heat before it enters

rative furnaces.
A paper by Mr. C. J. Homer, on the North Staffordshire
Coalfields, had to be considerably curtailed, and two other
papers had to be taken as read, in order that the excursion
programme might be carried out. Indeed, one of the
chief objects of the autumn meeting of the Institute is to
visit places of interest from an industrial point of view,
and hence the number of papers read is generally limited.
This year the visits and excursions were very numerous
indeed to industrial establishments in and around Man-
chester, and all of them seem to have been completely
successful. Our space does not permit us to give a
detailed account of these excursions, although many
of the processes witnessed by the visitors were of con-
siderable scientific interest. The meeting was brought
to a successful termination on Friday by a visit, which
formed, indeed, a hard day's work, to the North Stafford-
shire iron and coal district. From first to last the
members of the Institute have good reason to be satisfied
with the Manchester meeting.
In conclusion, we must express a hope that ere long
our other great industries will follow the example of
the iron and steel trade in forming their own special
technological Institutes and holding meetings and pub-

scientific education is capable of being elevated,
few will not place foremost the extension of theoretical
studies into first principles and collateral branches which
have a bearing, ever so little as it may appear to be, on
the main subject. How much, for instance, does physio-
logy suffer from a deficiency in mathematical and physical
knowledge on the part of many of its most enthusiastic
devotees. A wider general acquaintance with chemistry
would, also, not be out of place. Practical aptitude and
experience no doubt stand next in 'importance. A mas-
tery of the methods by which what is already known has
been arrived at cannot but be one of the best trainings
for original investigation. How many a valuable sugges-

One of the most important novel points of manipulatory
detail which we notice, is the value of mucilage as an
imbedding agent when the microtome is employed for
freezing, as suggested by Dr. Pritchard. It depends on
the fact that "frozen mucilage can be sliced as readily
as a piece of cheese," a most valuable property, as all
who have had any experience will acknowledge.
Prof. Rutherford has supplied a deficiency. He has
given us a manual which will meet the requirements of a
large class of students who will never find it necessary to
enter into the details of practical histology so minutely
as they are discussed in larger works, such as the " Hand-
book for the Physiological Laboratory," or the still deeper
manual of Strieker.

had been very much longer. He has made several
voyages among the Pacific Islands during the last

eight years, and, judging from this and what he tells us
in the work before us, he must possess much valuable
information concerning these islands, and especially with
regard to their puzzling populations, which he would do
well to publish in detail, and which would be welcomed
especially by ethnologists. Mr. Wood is evidently a
careful observer, and has the power of describing what he
observes interestingly and clearly.
The present volume contains a narrative of a cruise
which the author made, starting from New Zealand,
from May to December 1873, among some of the most
interesting groups of the Pacific Islands. Among the
slands visited during this time were Rotumah, to the
N.E. of Fiji, Futuna, Savaii, and Upolu, in the Samoan
group; Niuafu, some of the islands in the Fiji group, the
New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, the Caroline Islands,
Oualan, the Mulgrave Islands, and the Ellice group. Con-
cerning every island which he visited, Mr. Wood has some
interesting and valuable information to give, either
about its physical condition, its products, its people, its
history, or its antiquities. One of the main objects of his
cruise was the collection of native implements and
weapons, and in this he seems to have succeeded to his
heart's content. His observations concerning the people
seem to us especially valuable ; he has gathered many
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
traditions as to their migrations, and gives some speci-
mens of folk-lore. In many of the islands the natives
seem restless and discontented, and Mr. Wood was fre-
quently petitioned to give them a passage from one
island to another. Like many other Pacific voyagers, he
has but a poor opinion of the results of the attempts
which have been made to Christianise the natives. Not
that he disapproves of attempting to civilise them
and to raise them in the scale of humanity, but he thinks
the methods which are generally adopted are quite
abortive. The unmodified European garment of civilisa-
tion evidently cramps and enervates the Pacific Islander.
The information which Mr. Wood gives concerning the
Rotumans, their traditions as to their predecessors in the
island, their migrations, customs, superstitions, folk-lore,
&c, is especially valuable. He refers briefly to the
remarkable mounds among the hills in Bonabi, or Ascen-
sion Island, in the Caroline group, about which them
have no tradition, but which would be likely to repay a
careful examination. Quite as interesting, and still more

I did not at first perceive. He says that I "object to the possi-
bility of assuming high local temperatures to be produced by
the transformation of tangential forces into heat within the earth's
crust ;" as if I objected to any localisation. What I did object
to was, not a localisation of work and heat, but a localisation
within a localisation, such that the heat of crushing a certain
localised volume should fuse a further localised portion of the
crushed volume.

Important Discovery of Remains of jCervtu megactros in
Ireland
During 1847, when draining a bog at Kellegar among the
Dublin mountains, as many as thirty heads of C. megaceros,
together with a perfect head and antlers of a Reindeer, were dis-
covered in a cutting of about ICO yards, by 3 yards in breadth.
They were found as usual in the marl and clay under the bog.
I visited this locality in March last, and from the aspect of the
ground and evidence of a farmer who remembered the spot where
the above were dug up, it seemed probable that by running a series
of trenches parallel with the original ditch made in 1847, fresh
exuvice might be discovered. The subject was accordingly
brought to the notice of the Royal Irish Academy, and a grant
of 25/. obtained. The result has been the finding of about thirty
additional heads of Cervus megaceros, besides numerous detached
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
bones not yet fully determined.
Mr. R. J. Moss, Keeper of Mimerals in the museum of the
Royal Dublin Society, who volunteered to conduct the explora-
tions, writes to me that he found the remains embedded in about
two to three feet of clay, aud often either lying on or impacted
between blocks of granite as if they had been drifted into the
aboTe situation. A log of oak three feet in length was dis-
covered among the bones in the same stratum of day. In this
instance, as generally obtains in Ireland, the cervine exuviae are
met with around the maigins of the bogs, and not in the middle,
as if the animals were mired in shallow water, or else their carcases
had drifted with the winds or currents to the sides and outlets of
the lake. Mr. Moss had to stop excavations in consequence of
the grant having become expended, so that doubtless many more
remains await further explorations.
This is not the only case known to me of the accumulation of
carcases in a small space. I just lately examined a large assort-
ment of skulls and bones of C. megaceros dug out of a bog
on the property of Mr. R. Usher, of Cappagh, near Dungarvan.
These were collected in a space of about 100 yards in length and

THE NEXT RETURN OF ENCKE'S COMET.—The ap-
pearances of this comet at nearly ten-year intervals in
1819, 1829, 1838, 1848, 1858, and 1868 took place under
circumstances which were more or less favourable for
observation in this hemisphere; these conditions, how-
ever, will not attend the ensuing return to perihelion,
which, with the mean motion found by Dr. von Asten for
1875, neglecting the small effect of perturbation, would
occur about the 27th of July, 1878; and if the path in the
heavens be calculated on this assumption, it will appear
that observations will hardly be practicable except in the
southern hemisphere in August. The nearest approach to

this track is that which the comet followed in 1845, when
a few observations only were obtained with difficulty at
Rome, Washington, and Philadelphia. With regard to
the effect of perturbation upon the length of this comet's
period since the year 1819, when its periodicity was first
detected, it may be remarked that the longest revolution
was that from 1842-45, which extended to I2I5'6 days,
and the shortest, that from 1868-71, 1200-2 days; differ-
ence of extremes, 15^ days.
COMET 1874 (III.), COGGIA.—A third computation of
the orbit of this fine comet, founded upon observations
between April 20 and July 16, by Herr Geelmuyden, of
Lund, has resulted in an ellipse with a period of 10,445
years, confirming the great length of the revolution which
resulted from the calculations of Prof. Tietjen and Herr
Schulhof. There appears to be no probability of the
comet having previously visited these parts of space
within historical times.

of high rank, if broken, as this has been, would naturally
be preserved; and that it is but the half of such an one,
as seen in Fig 1, is proved by the fact of a hole being
drilled in the lower corners, as shown by the dotted lines;
a hole that became of no use when the specimen was
broken, or at least was less well placed than that sub-
sequently drilled in order to suspend the relic as an
ornament, as an ear-ring, or addition to a necklace, as
previously suggested.
The traces, as they really are now, of the graves of our
aborigines occasionally contain a single specimen of the
above-figured relic. So far as I have been able to
examine these graves, such relics are never associated
with the stone axes and spear-heads characterising the
graves of adult males, but simply with other forms of
stone ornaments, and a single small mortar and pestle,
or earthenware vase. In one instance the "brooding
bird " was so placed with reference to the narrow strip of

discoloured earth that marked where the body had been
laid, as to show conclusively that the relic was attached to
the hair, as shown in Fig. 1.
If we examine a series of these relics, it will be at once
seen that every one has holes drilled at the lower corners.
Such specimens could only be worn upon the top of the
head, without being upside down, as would necessarily be
the case had they been suspended. It must, too, be borne
in mind that these relics are nowhere very abundant, but
on the other hand, nowhere unknown north of Mexico.
Had they been knife-handles, as suggested by School-
craft, or corn-huskers, as suggested by various writers,
certainly they would be much more abundant than they
really are. Indeed, in considering them as ornaments for
married women, I am forced, in consideration of the
scanty number that have been collected, to restrict them
to women prominent in their tribes, the wives of kings,
chiefs, and eminent warriors. If this be true, then the
eight birth-records on Fig. 2 are those of "Indian
princes," it may be. I must admit, however, that this
broken specimen is the only one that I have seen having
like marks cut upon it; but such record marks, as I
believe them to be, are quite common upon other forms
of stone ornaments, particularly those stone tablets and
crescents that I have elsewhere (Smithson. Ann. Rep. for
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
1874) called " breast-plates."
These facts considered, I think that the suggestion of
Mr. Gillman, based upon information received from an
aged Indian, truly explains what this much-discussed relic
truly is—an ornament for married women, an emblem of
maternity. Charles C. AisnoTT

ordinarily numerous and interesting. A mass of meteoric iron fell
on Aug. 24,1873, at Maysville, California, and is one of the very
few metallic irons the actual descent of which has been wit-

had now been finished, and that portions of it had been forwarded
to different mints for the purpose of being assayed. The reports
read were very satisfactory, as was shown by the fact of M. Stas,
of Brussels obtaining 99995 parts of pure gold out of 1,000 as
the result of an analysis. The same plate had also been exa-
min sd by Mr. Lockyer by means of the spectroscope, and the
lines having been compared with the solar lines, it had been
shown that silver, copper, and iron were absent, and that there-
fore the purification of the metal had been very great.

Chemical Society, with the request that they would send back
answers; this plan had been found to work well with very few
exceptions, who declined to give up the processes which they
alone employed. The report ended by the committee desiring
to be re-appointed, and expressing a confident expectation that
by the end of another year some really good results would be
obtained.—The President remarked, at the conclusion, that the
estimation of potash seemed to present much less difficulty than
that of phosphoric acid.
Second Report of a Committee, ¦ consisting of Prof. A. S.
Herschel and G. A. Lebour, on Experiments to determine
the Thermal Conductivities of certain Rocks, shmving especially
the Geological Aspects of the Investigation.—The experiments
during the past year were directed chiefly to a re-examina-
tion, with improved apparatus (fully described in the report), of
the rocks observed last. year. With the exception of Kenton
sandstone, which was m1* placed in the last table, all the rocks
have, under the new mode of treatment, kept the same relative
positions, and the absolute conductivities given in the present
report are believed to leave little or nothing to be desired on the
score of accuracy. Quartz has been added to the list, and proves
to have less resistance to the passage of heat than any of the
other snbstances examined. Slate has been tried both in the line
of cleavage and across it, showing less resistance in the latter posi-

tion than in the former. Some rocks have been experimented
on wet as well as dry, the addition of the water giving an
increased conductivity of a tolerably constant value. It is
intended to continue the experiments in the direction fore-
shadowed by these results. A full table of absolute conduc-
tivities and resistances, with the results of both series of experi-
ments compared, forms part of the report. Coal still maintains
its position with the greatest resistance yet found.

Great Britain. AH who are ambitious that our country should
bear a prominent part in contributing to the common stock of
knowledge, and all who know the effect upon individual character
and happiness of the habit and occupation of scientific inquiry,
must regret our backwardness in this respect. The immediate
cause is easily found. It is not that English workers are less
inventive or industrious than their fellows across the Channel,
but that their number is exceedingly small How comes it that
in a country which abounds in rich and leisurely men and women
—for neither the reason of the case, nor the jealousy of the
dominant sex, nor partial legislation excludes women from
sharing this pursuit with men—there are so few who seek the
excitement and delights of chemical inquiry? Moralists tell us
that the reason why some men are content with the pleasures of
eating and drinking and the like is, that they have never had
experience of the greater pleasure which the exercise of the
intelligence affords. I am not about to represent it as the moral
duty of those who have means and leisure to cultivate chemistry
or any branch of science ; but no taste for a pursuit can be deve-
loped in the absence of any knowledge of its nature. A taste
for chemistry is often spoken of as a peculiar bias with which

certain men are bom. No doubt there are differences in natural
aptitudes and tastes, but the chief reason why it is so rare for
men of leisure to addict themselves to scientific pursuits is, that
so few boys and young men have had experience of the pleasure
which they bring. Much has been done during the last twenty
years, both a.t the Universities and at the Public Schools, to
provide for the teaching of science. To speak of what I know
best, the University of Oxford has made liberal provision for the
teaching of science, and for its recognition -among the studies
requisite for a degree; nor have the several colleges been back-
ward in allotting scholarships and fellowships as soon as and
whenever they had reason to believe that those elected for pro-
ficiency in science would be men equal in intellectual calibre to
those elected for proficiency in classics or mathematics. But the
result is somewhat disappointing, and under a free-trade system
science has tailed to attract more than a small percentage of
University students. Excellent lectures are delivered by the
professors to scanty audiences, and the great bulk of those edu-
cated at the University receive no more tincture of science than
their predecessors did twenty years ago.
The recognition of science among the subjects of University
examinations is by no means an unmixed advantage to those
concerned. Examinations have played and will continue to play
a useful part in directing and stimulating study, and in securing
the distribution of rewards according to merit; but they produce

in the student, as has otten been pointed out, a habit of looking
to success in examination as the end of his studies. This habit
of mind is peculiarly alien to the true spirit of scientific work.
Only such knowledge is valued as is likely to be producible at
the appointed time. Whether a theory is consistent or true is
immaterial, provided it is probablt, that Is to say, advanced by
some author whose authority an examiner would recognise. All
incidental observations and experimental inquiry lying outside
the regular laboratory course, which are the natural beginnings
of original work, must be eschewed as trespassing on the time
needed for preparation. The examination comes; the University
career is at an end; and the student departs, perhaps with
a considerable knowledge of scientific facts and theories,
but without having experienced the pleasure, still so easily
gained in our young science of chemistry, of adding one new fact
to the pile of knowledge, and, it may be, with little more inclina-
tion to engage in such pursuit than have most of his contempo-
raries to continue the study of Aristotle or Livy.
However, examinations have their strong side, to which I
have referred, as well as their weak side; and although it is the

do more than any centralised scheme for the promotion of che-
mical research.
To the advancement of chemistry by the formation of public
opinion on the questions of scientific education and the endow-
ment of original research, the Chemical Section of the British
Association may reasonably hope to contribute. But doubts
have been expressed as to the serviceableness of this or any such
organisation tor the direct advancement of our science itself. No
doubt we cannot accomplish much. Chemical inquirers at the
present time may be compared to a party of children picking
wild flowers in a large field : at first all were near together, but
as they advanced they separated, till now they are widely scat-
tered, singly, or in groups, each busy upon some little spot,
while for every flower that is gathered ten thousand others remain
untouched.
That the science of chemistry would advance more rapidly if
it were possible to organise chemists into working parties,
having each a definite region to explore, cannot, I think, be
doubted. Is such organisation in any degree possible?
The experiments of which Bacon has left a record, though
curious historically, have no scientific value. But in one respect

his "Physiological Remains" furnish an example which we
might follow with profit. "Furthermore," he writes, "we pro-
pose iiiishts of such things as are hitherto only desired and not
had, together with those things which border on them, for the
exciting the industry of man's mind." I will quote further, as
an example, a part of one of his "wishes," which has very
recently been fulfilled. "Upon glass four things would be put
in proof. The first, means to make the glass more crystalline.
The second, to make it more strong for falls and for fire, though
it come not to the degTee to be malleable."
I do not know that the industry of M. de la Bastie's mind
was excited by Bacon's mention of glass more strong for falls and
for fire among things hitherto only desired and not had; but the
conception ol such an enumeration seems to me worthy ol its
author. Much fruitless and discouraging labour might be saved,
a stimulus might be given to experimental inquiry, and chemical
research might become more systematic and thus more produc-
tive, if Bacon's example were followed by the leaders of chemistry
at the present day.
The Council of the Pharmaceutical Conference, whose meeting
has just preceded our own, has published a list of subjects for
research which they commend to the attention of chemists.
Where one of these subjects has been undertaken by any chemist
his name is appended to it. Might not the representatives of
scientific chemistry issue a similar list?
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Perhaps two or three of the distinguished English chemists
who are members of this Association might be willing to serve
on a committee which should put itself into communication with
the leaders of chemical inquiry abroad, and should make and
obtain and publish suggestions of subjects for research. Such a
list so got together would, I think, find a welcome place in all
scientific journals, and would thus be widely known and easily
accessible to every student.
That which chiefly makes the organisation of chemical inquiry
desirable is the boundless extent of the field upon which we have
entered. Not every fact, however laboriously attained and
rigorously proved, is an important fact, in chemistry any more
than in other branches of knowledge. Our aim is to discover
the laws which govern the transformations of matter; and we
are occupied in amassing a vast collection of receipts for the pre-
paration of different substances, and facts as to their composition
and properties, which may be of no more service to the general-
isations of the science, whenever our Newton arises, than were,
I conceive, the bulk of the stars to the conception of gravitation.
It may, however, be urged that the growth of chemical theory
keeps pace with the accumulation of chemical facts. It is so, if

Dr. Hector, chief of the New Zealand Survey, gave a most
interesting account of the modes of occurrence of the Moa bones
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
in New Zealand. He used the term Moa in preference to that
of Dinomis, because the bones of the New Zealand birds were
now divided among so many genera. He demonstrated most
conclusively that the knowledge ot their former existence was
not communicated to the Maoris by the Europeans, who deduced
their structure from iheir remains, but, on the contrary, was
imparted to the latter by the former. Up to recent times there
had been a constant fulfilment of the statements mode by the
Maoris concerning the localities in which the bones would
be; found. He believed there was . no hope of ever finding
the birds alive, for he himself had been over the whole of the
islands very thoroughly without seeing them. Dr. Hector exhi-
bited a map of New Zealand on which were denoted all the
areas in which Moa bones had been found, and all the localities
in which considerable finds of bones had been made, with indica-
tions of their condition or surroundings. He found that the
country occupied by primeval forefts before the advent of Euro-
peans was that in which Moa bones did not occur. His deduc-
tion was that they lived in the open and low scrub, in which
they could walk. In all this region, within his own memory,
the Moa bones were extremely abundant in the South Island, all
over the ground ; but these bones were very rarely found in col-
lections, for they were usually decomposed and split and warped.
In the enormous extent of Sub-Alpine country in the South
Island, which was covered by only a light vegetation, large

quantities of well-preserved Moa remains had been recently
found, associated with remains or reliques of natives. It appeared
to him that the natives had pressed up the country for the pur-
pose of capturing, killing, and eating the Moas; and as the
natives could not follow them through the sharp bayonet-grass
and other underscrub, they seemed to have got at them by setting
portions of it on fire, which collected the animals together, often
killed them, and accounted for so many of their bones being
accumulated in particular spots. And in some of these localities
where the Moas were destroyed by fire, little heaps of chalcedonic
quaitz pebbles, which were their crop-stones, were found, each
heap associated with the remains of one bird. And this fact, of
their being the crop-stones, had been conclusively proved by the
discovery of a carcase crushed and decayed so as to be unfit for
anatomical purposes, but containing within the thorax just such
a little heap of pebbles as had been described. The second
chief mode of occurrence of Moa bones was in the turbary
deposits and desiccated swamps, occurring in almost all the
valleys leading to the east coast. One notable deposit was at
Glenmark, where the remains of a terrace at a higher level had
been cut through by the stream, leaving a large turbary deposit

NATURE
There was a great profusion of ferns, mosses, and lower'crypto-
gams; and evergreens were abundant. The species were
few in proportion to the ^genera, and the genera in propor-
tion to the orders. The proportion of indigenous plants and
of species to any area was generally small; but in Bourbon there
was the great number of 1,700 species. The most remarkable
genus in the group, perhaps, was Pandanus, the screw-pine,
which had species peculiar to each island, though the commonest,
P. ulilis, occurred on all three islands. Certain genera were
found to be endemic to the group, especially in the Rubiacese
and Composita:. In addition, in each island there were certain
genera endemic to that island alone. In North-western Bourbon,
although, as in Mauritius, settlers had produced much alteration
by cutting down trees, &c, there was still an abundance of
plants which flourished in a moist climate. The flora of Mauri-
tius exhibited affinities with that of N. W. Bourbon, although
possessing endemic genera. Perhaps no place in the world had
had its flora so much altered by settlers, especially by means of
fires through carelessness. The original flora had been almost
exterminated. The few plants now remaining included one new
genus ; and there were certain peculiar Pandani, but the general

type was allied to that of Mauritius. In many of the small
volcanic and coral islands which surround Mauritius and
Rodriguez, very often little more than rocks, there were genera
which were peculiar to those islands, or else species that were
representatives of other species existing on the main islands.
Round Island, a mere cone near Mauritius, had three genera of
palms represented by different species, which were found no-
where else; and exhibited many other peculiarities in its flora.
Dr. Balfour reserved his opinion on the vexed question of the
origin of these islands by independent volcanic action or by the
submergence of an ancient continent connected with Africa; but
stated that soundings taken between Mauritius and Rodriguez,
about fifty miles west from the latter, gave a depth of 2,000
fathoms ; while 100 miles S. W. of Mauritius the depth was 2,700
fathoms.—Prof. Williamson remarked on the parallel between
these facts and those first brought to light by Mr. Darwin relative
to Galapagos. It appeared that these modifications of species
and genera were such as must necessarily have resulted from
modifications in a long course of time; and they compelled
naturalists to accept Mr. Darwin's views whether they liked them
or not. Coupled with the facts derived by Mr. Wallace from
the Indian Archipelago, he thought considerable probability was
given to the submergence theory. — Prof. Dickson could not see
that the occurrence of representative forms on different oceanic
islands was any stronger proof of evolution than the facts relating
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to the grouping of plants about geographical centres; but Prof.
Williamson maintained that the occurrence of distinct yet analo-
gous species on contiguous islands of very recent geological age
was a striking evidence of modification produced by new physical
conditions, unless indeed distinct new creative acts were admitted
within a comparatively modern period.
Prof. Williamson gave an account of his recent discoveries
among the fossil seeds of the coal measures, and partly con-
firmed and partly controverted Brogniart's views on some of the
same seeds. He (Prof. Williamson) gave the name Lagenostoma
to a form of seed larger and more bulky than a grain of rice,
which had a flask-shaped cavity above the nucleus, between
it and the micropyle. This cavity was surrounded by a mem-
brane quite distinct from that investing the nucleus. Prof.
Williamson believed that he had found pollen grains in this
cavity, and that the only difference between this and an ordinary
coniferous seed consisted in the presence of this chamber, which
protected the pollen and brought it into contact with the nucleus.
Another seed of the same general type had the upper part of the
nucleus contracted, forming a sort of mammilla : thus the cavity
above became of a different shape. He named it Physostoma.

Mr. John Evans described fully the proposed code of symbols

special investigations as to the community of culture in India

of Dartmouth, at the base of the chromosphere, though the
chromospheric shadow should perhaps be taken into|the account.
The importance of a ituly of this absorbent atmosphere be-
comes evident if we admit that the greater part of the 500°
which separate the temperature of fie temperate zone from abso-
lute zero is principally due to the sun's radiation. To this
atmosphere new matter is constantly being added and taken
away by the continual changes of the interior surface. Any
alteration in the capacity for absorption—say a difference of 25
per cent., which could hardly be recognised by observation—
would alter the temperature of our globe by 100°. The e xist-
ence of life on the earth is clearly dependent on the constancy
of the depth and absorption of this solar envelope. Hitherto

heat by contraction of the sun's mass—an operation likely to go

rapid variation. If changes in the depth of this solar envelope
are cyclical, they would be accompanied by cyclical alterations
of earth's temperature. This may serve alike to explain the
characteristics of variable stars and the vast secular changes on

of the globe and the near future of life upon it.
Prof. Thomas Meehan, ofGermantown, Penn., made an attack
on Darwinian theories in a paper which disputed the assumption
that insects are a material aid in the fertilisation of plants. He
drew the following conclusions: (1) That the great bulk of
coloured flowering plants are self-fertilisers. (2) That only to a
limited extent do insects aid fertilisation. (3) Self-fertilisers are
in every way as healthy and vigorous, and are immensely more
productive, than those dependent on insect aid. (4) That when
plants are so dependent they are the worse fitted to engage
in the struggle for life—the great underlying principle in natural
selection.
Prof. Morse described the evident characteristics of insects
which seemed not only fitted for fertilisation, but were found
actually engaged in the process. He was not prepared to aban-
don the vast mass of facts already obtained on account of the
few and doubtful experiments detailed by Prof. Meehan. Prof.
Riley thought that the fact that insects were absolutely essential
to the existence and perpetuation of many plants, had been proved
by experiments and observations so numerous and convincing
that it could no longer be denied. He mentioned his own ex-
periments with the Yucca; and he met and combated the theory
that self-fertilisation, like interbreeding, did not tend to deterio-
ration. Prof. Meehan, in explanation of his views, stated that
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
he regarded the present dependence of plants upon insects as an
evidence of weakness and accident, or of deformation in the
plant. Prof. Riley said that it was a mistake to suppose that
insect life was scarce in the Rocky Mountains.
A paper was presented On some New Fossil Fishes and their
Zoological Relations, by Prof. J. S. Newberry, of Columbia
College, giving brief descriptions of interesting fish remains
found during the past year in the Devonian and Carboniferous
rocks of Ohio. Of these, the most important "find" was that
of nearly the entire bony structure of a single individual of
Dinichthys Terrellii, the hugest of all the old armour-plated
Ganoids. Life-size drawings of most of these bones were exhibi-
ted to the Association, and copies of them will appear in the
second volume of the "Geology of Ohio," now going through
the press. Drawings of another species of Dinichthys was
shown (D. Hertzeri) in which the maxillaries and mandibles
are set with teeth instead of being sharp-edged. The remains
of both these monsters have been found only in the upper
Devonian rocks of Ohio. Prof. Newberry also exhibited to the

this paper was the statement that one of the buttock muscles
supposed to be peculiar to the higher apes, distinguishing them
from man, really existed in the human body and in a similar
position. It was shown that the muscle thus described by Traill,
and afterwards by Wilder as in the chimpanzee, and by Owen and
Bischoffas in the orang, and by Coues as in the opossum, is also
found in man, and offers no distinction in this respect. Three
new muscles about the hip-joint, found in the orang and some
other apes, were also made the subject of description; these
muscles have no homologues in man. Two of these act to rotate
the leg and draw it inward; the other seems too small to have
any functional value and is probably a rudiment, but is interest-

ing as occurring also in some of the lower apes and the opossum.
The other muscles in this region of the body were like those of
man, but in the case of an orang the short head of the biceps of the
thigh was found entirely separated. This is only occasionally the
case with the orang, and this peculiarity is not known to exist in
any other animal. The two large external muscles of the calf
do not unite with each other to form a single tendon Achillis,
consequently in the orang this tendon is double, which sometimes
occurs with marsupials. These investigations, which were ex-
plained in much technical detail, tend to prove that all the
muscles possessed by man can be traced backward in the lower
forms of animals, through the apes to the lemuroids.

Prof. George F. Barker, of Philadelphia, read a paper
On the Cause of the Relative Intensity of the Broken Lines

general result of a series of measurements made to ascertain, by
Vierordt's method, the relative intensity of these various lines,
and to compare these with their lengths measured micrometri-
cally. Vierordt's method consists in measuring the intensity of
a coloured light by the amount of white light necessary to extin-
guish it. By means of a third telescope attached to the spectro-

scope, a bright slit of light may be thrown upon any portion of
the spectrum, and by varying the distance of the source of this
light, until it extinguished the various spectrum lines in the order
of their brightness, a series of numbers was obtained which, by the
law of the inverse squares, gave the relative intensity of the
different spectrum lines. The metals experimented upon were
copper, gold, silver, antimony, bismuth, and magnesium. The
general result is, that in no case does the length of the spectrum
line follow the law of brightness. Hence some other hypothesis
must be suggested to account for the phenomena. The author
suggested one which seemed to him to be at least possible, and
to be sustained by the prevalent views on molecular and atomic
physics. The constitution of a gas is simple ; the molecules com-
posing it move in straight lines, and encounter each other and the
walls of the containing vessel in so complex a way that Prof. Max-
well doubts if mathematics can follow their paths. The oscillations
of the atoms within the molecule, are, however, less complex;
they either are simple harmonic motions themselves, or they may
be resolved into such. It is these harmonic vibrations which,
communicated to the ether, cause the spectrum lines; the

IN the general advance of scientific knowledge which
has taken place during the last half-century, the
science of acoustics has hardly received its fair share of
attention. Founded on principles originated by the
ancients, and afterwards extended by Galileo, Newton,
Taylor, Sauveur, Bernouilli, Euler, Smith, Young, and
others, the first great and complete work on it was
"Die Akustik," of Chladni, published in Germany in
1802, but which is chiefly known by its French trans-
lation.
It acquired a high and wide reputation, and it has ever
since been a standard authority on the subject. Sir John
Herschel's celebrated treatise on Sound in the " Encyclo-
paedia Metropolitana," carried the theoretical views of the
science much further, and so supplied what was deficient

in Chladni's more practical work; but nothing of im-
portance has been added to our knowledge of the science
from Chladni's time till about fifteen years ago.
It was then known that one of the most eminent physi-
cists and physiologists of Germany, Herr Helmholtz,
Professor of Physiology at Heidelberg, had been devoting
considerable attention to the science of acoustics, and, if
we recollect aright, some of his discoveries were brought
forward by himself in lectures at our Royal Institution.
In 1863 appeared a work by him, entitled " Die Lehre von
den Tonempfindungen als physiologische Grundlage fur
die Theorie der Musik," the result of eight years' investi-
gations in acoustical science. This work not only gave
much new information on acoustical subjects generally,
derived almost entirely from the author's own long-con-
tinued investigations; but it published new and most
important discoveries as to the nature of musical sounds,
and valuable reflections on the bearing of these discoveries
on the theory of music generally. The work met with
high and universal appreciation among those who could
understand it; it went through three editions in Ger-
many, and was translated into French, which gave it a
much wider circulation. Helmholu's book has been fol-
lowed by two popular works in English, namely, "Lec-
tures on Sound," by Prof. Tyndall (1867), and "Sound
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and Music," by Mr. Sedley Taylor (1873), the chief object
of both being to expound Helmholtz's discoveries and
doctrines to English readers. We have now, however, a
translation into English of^the entire_work, as mentioned
at the head of our article.
In attempting to give some idea of the book, it is neces-
sary to premise that it treats of two distinct kinds of
subjects, physical and musical. In addition to being a
profound and practised physicist, the author has clearly
devoted much attention to the study of music, both theo-
retically and practically, and he has endeavoured to apply
bis physical discoveries and theories to the elucidation of
many points connected with the art which he has found
VOL. XH.—No. 308
obscure. We may therefore divide our notice into these
two heads.
In regard to the physical part of the subject, Helm-
holtz's work owes its greatest interest and its greatest
fame to the entirely new light he has thrown on the nature
of musical sounds, and the complete way in which he has
explained and accounted for phenomena in regard to

45°

nature of the body with which it is struck or rubbed, to
produce the sound. He further adds the suggestion that
such irregularities may be due to irregular tremblings of
the smaller parts of elastic bodies.
Sir John Herschel (" Encyclopaedia Metropolitana"),
speaking of musical sounds, says : "Of their quality and
the molecular agitation on which they depend, we know
too little to subject them to any distinct theoretical dis-
cussion."
To put the problem clearly, suppose we have two
musical sounds of the same pitch and the same degree of
loudness, but of different qualities. To what physical
cause is the difference in quality due? We know that
the rapidity and the amplitude of the vibrations is the
same in both cases; what other element of variation can
enter into the phenomenon? Helmholtz is ^the .first who
has given a complete answer to the question.
It very seldom happens that a musical sound consists
of one simple note; it is generally a compound of many
notes combined together. To illustrate this by a simple
example, suppose a stretched string, as a violin string or
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
pianoforte wire, sounds any particular note. This note,
which is called the fundamental one, will be due to the
vibrations of the string as a whole, and if we could pre-
vent any other kind of vibration this sound would be a
simple one. But the string has a natural tendency (for
reasons too recondite to enter upon here) to take upon
itself other partial vibrations, and thereby "to complicate
the effect produced. It will divide itself spontaneously
into two, three, four, five, six, or more aliquot parts, and
each of these parts will set up an independent.vibration
of its own, giving a new note corresponding to its length.
All these will sound together, and thus by the vibration
of the string we get not only the fundamental note (which
is usually the loudest and most prominent), but its octave,
its twellth, its double octave, its seventeenth, nineteenth,
and so on, all heard in addition, and giving a sound which
is a compound of them all. All the additional notes above
the fundamental have been usually called in England
harmonicsj Helmholtz calls them overtones (obertbne).
We have given a string as a simple example of the
mode of generation of a compound sound,, but such
sounds are produced in many different ways. A com-
pound sound, so far as its effect on the ear is concerned,
is due to a particular form of air-wave, produced in the
instance given by the superposition of different sets of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
vibrations of the sounding body; and such a form of
wave may be equally well produced by other means, such
as a reed ; or it may originate in the air itself, as in a flute.
In every case where a given fundamental note is found,
there is the same tendency for it to be accompanied by
subsidiary fractional vibrations, producing corresponding
overtones.
The phenomenon of compound sounds, as found by har-
monics or overtones accompanying fundamental sounds,
has been long known. It was mentioned by Mersenne
as early as 1636, and has since been noticed by Bernouilli,
Young, Rameau, Chladni, Sir John Herschel, Woolhouse,
and others ; but there is great difficulty in getting prac-
tical musicians, who have not been accustomed to consi-
derations of this nature, to admit that what, judging by
the practical impression on the ear, seems only a simple
and single note, can really be one compounded of a great
many sounds differing much in p tch, and some abso-
lutely discordant. Helmholtz^ endeavours to combat this
prejudice. He shows by several analogous physical and
physiological examples that^the senses are apt, in the pre-

NATURE
he deduces from it the explanation of the third property
we have mentioned of musical sounds, namely, their
quality or character of tone.
Chladni was perfectly aware of the complex and varied
nature of the vibrations producing musical sounds, but he
does not seem to have attached any importance to them
in this respect; for he says (p. 48, ed. 1830): "Die Verschie-
denheit der Schwingungsarten triigt meistens nur wenig
zu einer verschiedenen Wirkung des Klanges bei."
Sir John Herschel (Encycl. Metrop.) appears to have
doubted Chladni's assertion, for he hints clearly at the
probable influence on the quality of the sound, of the
form of the air-wave (which is only the result of the
complex vibration); and we may probably consider this
to be the first hint on record pointing to Helmholtz's
discovery.
Mr. Woolhouse, in an admirable little "Essay on
Musical Intervals, Harmonics, &c," 1835, goes further.
He says (p. 77), speaking of the complex vibrations of a
string: "The various combinations of these different
modes of vibration must have a considerable influence on

the musical quality and expression of the musical sound,"
which is a still nearer anticipation of the later doctrine.
Still, however, these anticipations were only guesses; it
was reserved for Helmholtz to put the matter in the
shape of a scientifically demonstrated fact. He has
shown, by the most elaborate and conclusive investiga-
tions, that the quality of a musical tone depends chiefly on
the number and on the comparative strength of the various
harmonica/ notes of which the tone is compounded.
The overtones accompanying a fundamental note may
be present in greater or less number, and they may vary
considerably in comparative loudness or softness, and it
is on the combination of these sources of variation that
the quality of the tone will depend—or, to put the expla-
nation in another and more scientific shape ; as the pitch
of a sound depends on the length or the frequency of
recurrence of the air-wave, and the loudness on the degree
of disturbance of the particles of the air therein; the
quality of tone depends on what is called its internal
form, or on the varieties of arrangement of expansion and
compression of the air contained within one complete
periodic cycle of oscillation.
Some modification in effect is often produced by a
sound being accompanied by unmusical noises, such as
the escaping of imperfectly used wind in a pipe, the un-

skilful scratching of the bow on a violin, the beating of
reeds, and so on; but these are rather impurities than
varieties of tone, and may be excluded from considera-
tion.
There are very few natural sounds which are entirely
simple, consisting of the fundamental note only. They
are best produced artificially by means of the "reson-
ators." The nearest approach to them may be found in
the larger stopped wood pipes of an organ, an old-fashioned
(not a modern) flute, and a tuning-fork after the sharp
ring has subsided. The vocal sound of the Italian U
(our 00) is also nearly a simple one. These examples will
give the idea that simple tones are soft, dull, and entirely
devoid of what is called brilliancy.
The addition of overtones gives this brilliancy and at
the same time adds life, richness, and variety. It is to
them that we owe entirely the agreeableness and pleasur-
able effect of musical tones. In proportion as the higher
overtones predominate, so will'the sound be bright and
sparkling, or if in great predominance it will become
metallic, thin, and wiry. If, on the other hand, the upper

has not stopped here. In chemistry, when a discovery
has been made of the constitution of a compound body, by
analysing it into its constituent elements, the efforts of the
chemist are naturally turned to the converse process of
proving the same proposition by synthesis, or by combi-
ning the single elements and showingthat they will produce
the compound. This proof has not been wanting in the
present case, for Helmholtz has succeeded in combining
simple sounds together in such a way as to produce imi-
tations not only of vocal sounds, but of many other pecu-
liar qualities of tone; not perfectly, from the extreme
difficulty of imitating exactly all the minute shades of
difference that enter into the combination, but still with
enough success to demonstrate the general argument.
We have given especial prominence to Helmholtz's
discoveries on the nature of musical sounds, because this
is in reality the great feature of his work, by which it
first acquired its fame, and by which his name will here-
after be honoured. But the physical part of the book
contains much beside this that is important and interest-
ing. His explanations on the general phenomena of

acoustics are most lucid, and often very original; and
his descriptions of the mechanism and action of the
organs of hearing, coming from one of the highest autho-
rities in physiology, are exceedingly instructive and
valuable.
In Part II. the author enters into an investigation of
what are called beats—a subject which has been hereto-
fore very obscure—and also of other acoustical pheno-
mena called " combination tones," which, though known
since the time of Tartini, have not been thoroughly
understood till Helmholtz gave their explanation. Into
these matters we have not, however, space to follow the
author: those who are interested in them can refer to the
book for themselves.
Before we leave the physical part of the work it will be
only just to testify to the excellence of the translation.
Mr. Ellis is so well known as a philologist and a man of
science, that his competence to deal with the work in a
literary and scientific point of view requires no comment,
and English readers may be satisfied that in this transla-
tion they have the original faithfully put before them.
His work has evidently been a labour of love, and he
deserves the highest credit for the trouble he has taken
over it.
At the same time all men are fallible, and when a great

authority condescends to do a work that could hardly be
expected from him, we must not be unprepared for some
little waywardness on his part, and there are a few things
which we would rather have seen otherwise done. The
title of the book is unfortunate; for, although no doubt
"The Sensations of Tone" is a correct translation of
"Tonempfindungen," yet to many English ears it will, we
fear, sound strange and unintelligible from the fact that
we are hardly accustomed in our language to understand
the word " tone " in the sense here intended. The English
title certainly does not give to the English reader anything
like the same idea as the original title, "Die Lehre von
den Tonempfindungen," does to an educated German.
The strict rendering of a German phrase does not always
correctly represent the original; for example, in speaking
of the clever little tract of Hauslick, "Ueber das Musicka-
Usch Scbone," Mr. Ellis translates it, "On the musically
beautiful," whereas, as every reader of the tract well knows,
the more appropriate expression in English would be " On
the beautiful in music."

Lord Watts. (London: Longmans and Co., 1875.)
In a recent number (vol. xii. p. 333) we published a letter
from Mr. Watts announcing the important fact that he
had succeeded in crossing the Vatna Jokull. So far as is
known, this is the first time that this jokull (which means
"glacier," and is probably cognate with the latter part of
our word ic-icle) has been crossed, and the fact is credit-
able to Mr. Watts's determination and perseverance. The
little book before us contains a narrative of an unsuc-
cessful attempt to accomplish the same object, made by
Mr. Watts in the summer of 1874. We regret to have
to say that the narrative is a disappointing one. It is
in the form of a rough diary, which seems to have been
sent to the press in its crude form and published with
little or no revision. A large portion of the book is
occupied with a statement of the many difficulties, petty
and serious, which Mr. Watts and his party encountered
in the journey from Reykjavik, by the Geysers, Hekla,
and the Myrdals Jokull to the Vatna Jokull, and there is
really very little information about the region through
which he passed. The entire narrative is extremely vague
and unsatisfactory, and if Mr. Watts has any literary
faculty, he certainly does not show it here; the reading
of his narrative is a heavy task. Mr. Watts ought to
know a great deal about the region with which this narra-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
tive is concerned, and especially about the jokulls in the
south of Iceland, and we would advise him to put this
information into a systematic form, make but little refer-
ence to the difficulties he encountered, obtain a few pho-
tographs on a much larger scale than the insignificant
things which appear in the present work, and we have no
doubt he would make a substantial contribution to our
knowledge of Iceland. The party succeeded in getting
only about half across the Vatna Jokull, when, from want
of the necessary means to go further, they were compelled
to turn back, after Mr. Watts had rather unnecessarily
and sensationally planted the union jack at his furthest
point. Mr. Watts's carelessness, to put it mildly, extends
even to his use of language. The use of " laid" for " lay"
might possibly be justified by eminent precedents;
"peninsular of rock" maybe a misprint, but "pulverent"
is unjustifiable, and "molusc" is shocking.
Perhaps the most tangible piece of information con-
veyed by Mr. Walts is contained in the following para-

Office referring to the tabulation of temperatures (vol. xii. p. 101).
From 1,283 estimations of tenths of seconds, as tabulated by the
highly-trained and experienced observers at Greenwich, he shows
that the whole seconds estimated were 15 per cent, of the whole
number, and thereupon remarks that this is precisely the excess
of whole seconds that is taken in the review of the work of the
Meteorological Office as indisputably proving the carelessness of
the tabulations at the Kew Observatory. This is a mistake.
Kew was not singled out for criticism because the whole degrees
tabulated there amounted to 15 per cent, of the whole number,
but because of "the irregularity of the tabulations, more espe-
cially as regards the tabulations from day to day." An exami-
nation of the tabulations at Kew from day to day shows that
there are first-class tabulators in that Observatory, but it also
shows there are others whose work is inferior. Thus, in the first
published sheet for Kew, viz., January 1874, on seventeen of the
days the whole degrees tabulated amounted on each of these
days to at least 2j per cent., and the average of the whole seven-
teen days reached 31 per cent., or nearly a third of the whole.
On the remaining fourteen days of the month the average was
14 per cent. Hence the variations of the numbers of whole

degrees from month to month, which, as stated in the review,
were 172 for January, 87 for February, 127 for March, and 94
for ApriL It is this irregularity in the work of tabulation
which has lowered the character of the work done at Kew.
The averages calculated from 6,696 tabulations showed that
the number of whole degrees read off at the seven observatories
were 8'4per cent, of the whole at Stonyhurst, I5'O at Kew,
19'S at Aberdeen, 21'2 at Armagh, 23-7 at Falmouth, 247 at
Valencia, and 24^8 at Glasgow. So lar as the mere average
numbers are concerned, the tabulations at Stonyhurst and Kew
are satisfactory ; not so, however, is the work done at the other
five observatories, especially the last three, where, on an average
of 6,696 tabulations, a fourth part of all tin: numbers tabulated
were whole degrees. For particular months the percentages are
sometimes very large. Thus, at Aberdeen during January 1875,
the following are the percentages ol the different decimal places
of the dry-bulb readings as printed by the Office :—

Source of Volcanic]Energy
A FEW words of explanation are necessary concerning my
letter which appeared in Nature, vol. xii. p. 396. Mr. Mallet's
prime source of energy for producing tangential pressures is the
force of cohesion developed in a cooling globe, gravitation giving
only partial assistance; and when I spoke of '' gravitation of the
whole mass to itself," I wished to convey that, setting aside alto-
gether the force of cohesion and its accompanying motions, there
still remains the force of gravitation, which, acting in a globe of
such size as the earth, and composed of heterogeneous materials,
must of itself produce enormous local pressures.
Mr. Fisher objects to my supposing the possibility of the de-
velopment of heat without room being left for motion, but so far
as I understand the doctrine of energy, it is only necessary to

have force for the production of heat when motion is impossible.
In Mr. Fisher's interesting paper his objection appears to be
to the localisation of fusing, and not to the localisation of heat,
fusing in some cases being prevented by the accompanying pres-
sure. But in my little diagram I attempted to explain that the
forces producing the high temperature might act in one set of
strata, the neighbouring strata above and below at the same time
being under much lower pressure, the pressure upon them being
equal to the pressure of the rocks doing the work, minus the
cohesion of said rocks; this difference of pressure being sufficient
to allow one set of rocks to melt while others are crushed.

refers generally to the discussion of the observations
of several of the minor planets with the view to correcting
the mass of Jupiter, and to the observations of elon-
gations of the fourth satellite by the present Astronomer
Royal at Cambridge, which last assigned for the denomi-
nator of the fraction 104677. He then remarks upon the
circumstance of Bouvard having deduced from his com-
parison of the theory of Saturn with seventy-four years'
observations a mass so nearly identical with that of the
Mtcaniquc Celeste; Bouvard left no details of his work
behind him; it is only known that he adopted at the out-
set the value of Jupiter's mass admitted at the time, that
of Laplace, and M. Leverrier explains that on the method
of procedure adopted, Bouvard could not do other-
wise than reproduce at the termination of his calcu-
lations the value he had assumed at starting. This
is illustrated by the result of Leverrier's solution of
his own equations of condition, founded upon the
much longer period of 120 years, which proved wholly
insufficient for the correction of Jupiter's mass. He
remarks, with respect to Bouvard's work, that any

value of the mass taken arbitrarily within certain limits
will allow of a tolerable representation of the observations
of Saturn, on the condition that this same arbitrary value
is introduced throughout in the functions representing the
mean longitude, mean motion, excentricity and longitude
of perihelion; the elements obtained by Bouvard are
therefore found represented by these functions of his
arbitrary quantity, and he reverts to the mass assumed at
the commencement of his work.
In conclusion, M. Leverrier insists that the use of the
elongations of the fourth satellite for the determination of
the mass of the Jovian system, has at present an incon-
testable superiority over the employment of the theory of
Saturn, on account of the too short period over which the
observations as yet extend, but'in the lapse of time this
superiority of the former method will diminish and the
use of the perturbations will become the more advan-
tageous. It is really, he adds, the same question as that
which presents itself with regard to the solar parallax,
which is determinable on two methods: the one, geo-
metrical, the method by transits of Venus; the other,
mechanical, depending for instance on the large in-
equalities in the motion of Mars. The method by transits,
so important in 1760, but limited in its means of applica-
tion, must eventually give way to the method of perturba-

tions, the accuracy of which will increase unlimitedly
with the course of time.
The first evaluation of the mass of Jupiter is that of
Newton in the Cambridge edition of the "Principia"
(1713), inferred from Halley's observation of an emersion
of Jupiter and his satellite from the moon's limb, giving
for the denominator of the fraction (whereby it is usual to
express the mass) 1033. In the later editions of the
"Principia" the mean distance of the fourth satellite
resulting from Pound's observations, to which allusion is
made [above, was substituted in the calculation of the
mass, which was found to be 1067. (It may here be men-
tioned that from later observations by Pound with a
micrometer on a telescope of 123 feet focus, on the mean
distance of the third satellite, Bessel found for the mass
1066). The next attempt in this direction appears to
have been made by Triesnecker, Director of the Obser-
vatory at Vienna. In 1794 and 1795, making use of a
Dollond object-glass micrometer, he obtained a series of
measures of distances of all four satellites, the notice of

MUCH as may have been written about bone-forma-
tion, yet this theme seems still to be inexhaustible,
as in the current series of the "Archiv fur mikroskopische
Anatomie" (of which we gave the contents in a former
report) no less than three papers are published on this
subject. Two of these, those by Strelzow and by Stieda,
speak of the ossification of cartilage and of bone-
growth, and arrive at quite contradictory results. The
older view on bone-growth starts from the supposition
that the bones once formed undergo no further plastic
change, that their single parts cannot displace each other,
that therefore an insterstitial growth cannot be imagined.
If the growing bone, as usual, does not merely show a
uniform increase in size, but little by little changes its
shape too (the bent bones for instance, the bends of which
change during growth), this naturally leads to the suppo-
sition that besides the deposit of fresh material, a solution
or absorption of those older materials took place, which
did not fit the new shape. In opposition to this view,
which Stieda also defends, Strelzow tries to prove that
the bone grows interstitially, that therefore it can change
its shape in an outward direction without reabsorption of
any of its parts, that it is useless therefore to suppose
the latter to take place, and that there is no reason for
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
such a supposition. Now, with regard to the change
from cartilage to bone, it has certainly been proved, for
most cases, that the cartilage is first destroyed before
in its place a bone grows from fresh materials. But
while Stieda thinks this the case everywhere, Strelzow
observes that the lower jaw and the shoulder-blade form
exceptions to the general rule, the cartilage there passing
immediately from its softer state to bone. Hertwig"s
observations, which he makes with regard to his investi-
gations of the teeth of Reptilia, have a much more exten-
sive range. In Hemibatrachia the teeth form earlier
than any other bones of the head, and starting from this
basis those bones in the oral cavity are destroyed, which
only cover the exterior of the original cartilage skeleton,
and are therefore called covering bones. In frogs these
bones certainly form without the help of the teeth,
which only appear at a later stage; but as frogs (Batrachia)
and salamanders (Hemibatrachia) are of the same order,
and particularly as the former are the more recent
family, Hertwig thinks that in their ancestors the forma-

the beginning"-of the seventeenth century. And why put
the sun in the common focus of all these ellipses? Are
there not also other curves followed by these planets in
their course around the sun? But once connected with
the principle of universal gravitation, these laws, so

Such at present is the position of the Laws of Storms.
Despite the adhesion of practical men, meteorologists do
not recognise the essential features which ou«ht, according

practical rules themselves which sailors have followed for
thirty years must be rejected; for they are entirely
founded, as we have seen,';on the circular movement of
the air in storms.
These criticisms,' more or/ less direct, based on the
theory of centripetal hurricanes or of aspiration, have
at the present time all the greater force that mariners
themselves have an innate belief in the mere idea of this
theory. We even find this belief in the writings of

authors who have shown themselves best acquainted
with the laws of storms and with the corresponding
practical rules. Two examples may be referred to.
The well-known hydrographic engineer, Keller, in his
"Treatise on Hurricanes," says that in intertropical
regions where cyclones originate, the atmospheric strata
underneath the sun dilate and draw up the inferior air of
the dilated zone; that if ordinary aspiration, due to the
calorific action of the sun, is further promoted by an
electric attraction, the affluent air will rush with more
force into the interior vacuum, &c. Within this space or
vacuum he conceives that the water of the sea raised by
the central aspiration of a typhoon or a waterspout
ascends. When the gyratory column passes from the sea
on to the land, it hurls against the shore the water raised
by aspiration, and the sea suddenly inundates the low
coast to a considerable distance inland. Finally, on land,
the force of aspiration of these phenomena exercises its
ravages not only by throwing down, but by tearing up
trees, and overturning even solid buildings.
M. Bridet, again, asserts that there is formed under the
action of the sun, a sort of vacuum insulting from the
rapid ascension of masses of heated air. This vacuum is
rapidly filled up by the lower currents of air which flow
towards it from all directions. These currents, flowing

along the surface of the earth, acquire a gyratory motion
from the daily rotation. On reaching the base of the
ascending column, near the centre of rarefaction, the air
carried by these currents gets heated, and expands in its
turn ; it follows the ascensional movement of the mole-
cules that it replaces, and rises, preserving its rotatory
motion.
Persuaded of the reality of this immense draught which
the aspiration of ascending columns of heated air must
exercise on the lower stratum, in the manner of a
chimney, sailors themselves must say that the circular
diagram which Reid and Piddington have used for cy-
clones is scarcely admissible from the theoretic point of
view; that already the centripetal movement has been
recognised in waterspouts and tornadoes, which, after all,
are only cyclones in miniature ; that the convergent dia-
grams proposed recently by Mr. Meldrum, of Mauritius,
have perhaps a better foundation, more especially if,
as Mr. Meldrum affirms in the cases of two storms which
he has recently discussed, these convergent diagrams better
represent the true features of the hurricane than concentric

of the purely meteorological question, and in the mean-
time place before the reader the conclusions of this
essay :—
1. The idea of centripetal hurricanes of aspiration
originates in an illusion of the sense of sight; it is an old
prejudice whose history it is easy to follow from the most
remote times to the present day.
2. The theory of centripetal hurricanes, suggested by
this prejudice and the hypotheses which it implies, cannot
be accepted. The adoption of similar idjas by enlightened
minds is only to be explained by the venerable authority
of this prejudice.
3. Bases of the mechanical theory of gyratory move-
ments; agreement of that theory with the Laws of
Storms. These ought to be considered as a first but
excellent approximation; a means of making further
advances.
I. History of a Nautical Prejudice.—In the midst of
the profound .'calm which often precedes thunderstorms,
the lower strata of the atmosphere are not agitated by the
least breath ; heavy clouds approach at a great speed and

cover the sky—a clear proof that powerful currents pre-
vail above, the influence of which does not extend to the
ground. From one of these clouds a sort of bag or end
of a tube or funnel is seen to issue, and which gradually
descends, lengthening at the same time. It seems to be
formed of the same material as the cloud ; and in fact
is a true fog which ^envelops the cloud, thus rendering it
visible to our eyes.
FIG. 5.
Meantime the centre of this funnel is agitated by a
violent whirling movement of which the small whirlwinds
of dust that are sometimes seen on our roads give a very
accurate idea. When the waterspout reaches the ground
and encounters obstacles in its way, it sets to work upon
these after the manner of a turning machine of great
speed at the end of a vertical axis. It raises around its
lower extremity a cloud of dust, overturns trees, batters
down walls, and unroofs houses. If, instead of land,
the waterspout meets with a water surface, it acts upon it
like a square-bladed scoop at the end of a vertical axis,
and the churned water is thrown to a distance in foam; if
it advances on a pool, is empties it in an instant ; if on a
lake or a sea, the water spurts out all round the foot of
the waterspout in clouds of spray.
Look particularly at this long vaporous tube (Fig. 5),

which extends from the surface of the earth to the clouds,
to a height of from 1,600 to 2,000 feet and upwards; it
appears flexible, and has an undulatory movement through
its entire length : the least breath of air alters and distorts
its form; and its whirling movements are felt down even
to its base, which sweeps over the earth, carrying devas-
tation in its train. If it assumes greater dimensions, it is
no longer a waterspout, but a tornado. We have here in
two words the history of the tornado of Jan. 20, 1854,
which occurred in the county of Knox, Ohio, and which
in half an hour levelled 50,000 trees with the ground,
hewing for.itself a pathway through the forest a quarter of
a mile broad, which could not have been made in some
weeks by a whole army of backwoodsmen.
The tube, which takes the form of a pillar, a funnel,
the trunk of an elephant, &:., usually disappears after
being as it were broken across, by the violence of its
own gyratory movements. Further, the misty vapours
which compose it slowly ascend, and the combination of
the ascending and whirling motions gives the appearance,
when seen at some distance, of a spirally ascending move-

Meteors of unusual brilliancy have been seen from several

accompanying tail of about 5° in length, from near 4 Arietis to a

blue to green, with red at bursting. Time .visible, about seven
seconds. It was seen by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Bellamy. Another
very peculiar one was seen from Edinburgh and neighbourhood
on the nth inst. A Burntisland correspondent, Mr. G. J. P.
Grieve, writes that about n p.m. that evening, while pacing a
gravel walk in moonlight and partly gasl'ght, a sudden vivid
gleam from behind threw his shadow clear cut on a bright
ground. Turning sharp to see the origin of the blaze, after a
second or so he noticed a serpentine meteor: the glow or trace
left in the path of a shooting star, whose maximum intensity, if

not explosion, lay at the west end of the trace. The trace
appeared in Auriga, and so close to the three leading stars next
south of Capella, that he had not the least difficulty in sketching
the position. The particulars are these :—Station in lat. N.

lation Auriga. Duration from first blaze to disappearance of
trace, three to four minutes. Timed at disappearance of trace,
11.2\ p. M. by Edinburgh gun time. Several letters on this serpen-
tine meteor—" the sky snake " they call it in the north—appear
in the Scotsman, all agreeing as to its peculiar form,and great
brilliancy. One observer near Mid Calder "was attracted by
the appearance of a magnificent meteor, which was visible for
about two seconds, and which, being apparently interrupted in
its flight, assumed a zigzag course; and, flashing brightly at
each angle thus formed, it disappeared, leaving the snake-shaped
track behind it, which was visible for several minutes afterwards,
finally disappearing in the form of a ring." On the night of the
14th inst. another magnificent one was visible, apparently over
all England. It is noticed in the Bradford Observer of the 15th,
and Mr. T. W. Shore writes us that he''saw it while in the
Southampton Water. The time of its appearance, both in the
north and south of England, was 8.30 p.m. Mr. Shore, while
looking towards the land on the north, observed the meteor com-
mence its luminous course at an apparent altitude of about 30°,
and travel to the horizon in a direction from S.E. to N.W. The

meteor appeared to him to be about three or four times the
brightness of Jupiter, and the time of its course rather more than
two seconds. The Bradford Observer states that "all accounts
agree in saying that it presented the appearance of a flying body
of light of considerable size, and that during the period of its
passage it lighted the whole sky. It would seem that it first
made its appearance from the south-west, its course being over
Bowling Park and in a north-westerly direction over Bowling,
Ilorton, and Manningham, and a spectator describes it as an
oblong body of light, several feet in length, and bearing the
appearance of some solid body in a state of combustion, the
sparks flying out on all sides, and a track of flame being left
after its passage. Its passage was accompanied by a noise as of
a loud explosion, which was plainly heard, not only by those
who were outside, but by persons inside the houses who did not
see the aerolite itself. All parties concur in saying that so strong
a light was cast around that a newspaper could easily be read for
the space of half a minute." The same meteor was seen from
Manchester and London, and no doubt from various other
places. In the report of the meteor of Sept. 3, 8 should be

ing Irom what is known of the Secondaiy strata near Boulogne,
and comparing them with those exposed in the middle of Eng-
land, it was hoped that the Palaeozoic rocks would be reached at
a depth not greater than 1,700 feet from the surface. In August
1874 the boring had reached a depth of 1,030 feet, and was then
delayed in consequence of an accident to the rods. This hole
was ultimately abandoned, and a new boring was commenced in
February 1875, which has been carried to a depth of 1,812 feet.
At this point the work has been stopped, in consequence of great
difficulties in keeping the hole clear, and it is not proposed to
continue the boring further. From the surface down to 175 feet
the strata are shales and impure limestones, with gypsum in the
lower part. These beds are referred to Purbecks, and with them
are now classed the lowest rocks exposed at the surface, formerly
called the "Ashbumham Beds." From 175 to 257 feet the
strata are.chiefly sand and sandstones; these are held to represent
the Portland Beds. Below 257 feet there is a great series of
bituminous shales and clays, with occasional bands of cement
stone and sandstone. Kimmeridge Clay fossils extend down to
1,656 feet at least, possibly lower; so that this formation is here
at least 1,400 feet thick. The bottom beds of the boring, just

reached, are oolitic in structure, and contain bands of hard lime-
stone. To this extent, then, the Secondary rocks have been
traversed, and their order and structure ascertained. A disco-
very of some commercial value has been made, for two com-
panies are in existence to work the gypsum. One of these has
been for some time in operation; a shaft has been sunk and the
mineral is now being raised. Scarcely less important is the
knowledge now attained that no supply of water can be got by
deep wells or borings into the Sub-Wealden strata. As regards
the Palsozolc rocks, the boring has not had the success that was
anticipated. The Secondary strata have proved too thick, and
there is little or no hope of reaching the older rocks here. A
boring is now in progress at Cross Ness by the Metropolitan
Board of Works; this will be carried through the gault, and
may possibly throw some light on this question.
Report of the Committee on Erratic Blocks, by the Rev.

without attempting the more ambitious task of connecting
the facts they report with theories of the history of the Glacial
epoch. It will be observed, however, (l) that the facts reported
increase our knowledge of the area over which erratic blocks
are distributed; (2) that the boulders are connected together in
more definite groups, distinctly pointing to special centres of
distribution ; (3) that the possibilities are increasing of obtaining
a more exact history of the periods into which the great Glacial
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
epoch must be divided from the grouping and distribution of
erratic blocks. Boulders and scratched stones are reported in
South Devonshire. New Red Sandstone boulders occur on the
left bank of the River Dart, at Waddeton, the largest measuring
6X3 feet, at elevations extending from 15 to 200 feet Are
they travelled masses? If so, whence did they come 7 When
were they lodged where they now lie? What was the agent of
transportation? The boulders may have been remnants of New
Red beds which once covered the older formations now
exclusively overlying the district; but the different levels at
which they are found, the present configuration of the surface of
the country, and the great weight of some of them, indicate the
possibility of their having been transported by ice from some
part of the district lying between Berry Head and Galmpton
Common. At Englebourne scratched blocks occur of fine
grained trap over an area having slate as its subsoil. Although
the size of these boulders renders their mobility under the action
of waves possible, yet the grooves upon them appear to indicate
ice action with considerable distinctness. A group of small
boulders of mountain limestone have been found in the north-
east of Hertfordshire, 100 miles from their source in Derbyshire.

diameter. This confirms the assertion that the rate of wave-pro-
gress varies directly as the square root of the wave length; be-
cause the rate of recurrence must vary as the rate of progression
divided by the path.
Experiment shows that a wave of 1 meter wave length would
travel 83 "07 meters in one minute if it did not alter its wave
length, and moved automatically. A cylindrical trough of water
more than, say, 500 millimeters deep and 1 '988 meters in
diameter, will, in the latitude of London, undulate in seconds,
and will remain isochronous with the London seconds' pendulum
wherever they travel together.
In rectangular troughs, the wave progress is hindered. The
rates ot recurrence of phase in rectangular troughs are slower
than in circular troughs when the wave lengths are the same;
and this difference is greater when the wave length is greater.
Both circular and rectangular troughs accept mononodal undula-
tion. The rate of progress between parallel walls of a wave
I meter long is found to be 74'7, and this is independent of the
distance of the walls apart. The mononodal undulations in
circular and rectangular troughs have also been examined.

SECTION B—Chemical Scienci
Prof. Cayley read a paper On the Analytical Forms called
Trees, with application to the theory of chemical combinations,
before a good audience composed to a considerable extent of
mathematicians.
The author in commencing stated that the subject he was
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
about to consider was more mathematical than chemical, but as
the results bore considerably upon the latter subject he had intro-
duced it in this Section. The problem to be solved was to find
the theoretic number of the hydrocarbons CnH j„ + s.
The only assumptions are that an atom of hydrogen can link
itself to one other atom, and an atom of carbon to four other
atoms. A combination of n carbon atoms can then link itself on
to 2n + j hydrogen*atoms at most, but this number is only attained
when the carbon atoms are linked together without cycles, or so
as to form a " tree ": given the tree, the hydrogen atoms can
be linked on in one way only, and the question thus is to find
the number of trees which can be formed with « carbon atoms.
The atoms, or dots representing them, are termed " knots," the
lines joining two knots are termed "branches"—the trees in
question are such that from each knot there proceed at most four
branches; but this limitation is in the first instance disregarded.
A tree may be considered as springing from any one of its knots
as its root, and trees which are chemically the same thus present
themselves under different forms. For the treatment of the
chemically distinct forms it is necessary to introduce the notions
of a "centre " and a "bicentre" (due to Prof. Sylvester); and

it is mixed with milk of lime, and thence on to a field or filter
bed 44 acres in extent, which ejects 80,000 gallons of water per
hour, pure enough for fish to live in. The greatest difficulty to
be contended with was the freeing of the precipitated matter
from the water, of which it contained 80 per cent ; this quantity,
however, was considerably reduced by means of mechanical
appliances, which reduced the water to such a percentage that it
could either be dried (and so rendered portable) by Jieat, or by
mixing it with some substance which increased its manurial value.

secure sanitary rather than commercial success, and that this cer-
tainly had been achieved at a cost of about sixpence per head per
annum for a population of 40,000.—Some discussion ensued as
to the relative merits of the method of irrigation and the method

make a great difference whether the soil consisted of clay or of
sand.
Prof. Debus read a paper On the chemical theory of Gunpowder,
in which he stated that nothing illustrated in so striking a manner
the molecular changes produced by chemical action as the ex-
plosion of gunpowder. He said that some years ago the
eminent French chemist Berthelot showed that if C02 be passed
into a mixture of BaO and CaO in insufficient quantity to preci-
pitate the whole of the barium and calcium as carbonate, then
neither is the whole of the barium precipitated nor the whole
of the calcium, but they are precipitated in a certain definite
proportion, which is a multiple of their molecular weights.
Hence, in general, If a mixture of the salts A and B be decom-
posed by some'other substance, C, in insufficient quantity to
decompose the whole of both, then the bodies formed will be
AC, + BC2 where C1 + C2 = C; and moreover, if the quantity
of B is doubled or trebled, &c, the quantity C2 will be increased
in a definite proportion. After making some further remarks of
a like nature on the decomposition of a mixture of BaCls and
Cad, by C02, and also of the explosion of mixture of II and CO
with an insufficient supply of oxygen (as investigated by Bunsen),
the Professor went on to show that the same arguments might
be applied to the explosion of gunpowder which was a mixture
of carbon, sulphur, and nitrate of potash.
He then placed upon the, black board the result of one of a

two litres of hydrogen evolved therefrom were passed through a

when a portion of the same arsenical zinc was treated with dilute

were passed through a heated tube as before, '0019 gramme of
arsenic was deposited in the cool part of the tube. Arsenical
zinc, when covered with spongy copper and acted upon with
dilute sulphuric acid, also gave arseniuretted hydrogen. This
appears to show that it is not the copper, but the inability of the
arsenic to get into solution when hydrogen is .made from water
and the "couple," which is confirmed by adding an aqueous
solution of arsenic to the same couple, when the minor imme-

bisulphide is heated in the presence of hydrogen, sulphuretted
hydrogen is formed.
The apparatus consists of a flask filled with pebbles and
asbestos (to expose a large surface to the action of lirai >, and
surrounded by fire-clay cylinders, in which gas is kept burning.
This flask is connected through a solution of lead with an aspi-
rator. There are other connections also by means of which gas
from the source requiring to be tested circulates through the
flask and is burnt. When the flask has been heated for about
twenty-four hours continuously (to expel all moisture), a mea-
sured quantity of water is drawn off from the aspirator, which
causes the same volume of gas to bubble through the lead solu-
tion, and on account of the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen to
produce a decolorisation of the lend solution. A similar vessel
containing the same quantity of lead solution and a known quan-
tity of sulphuretted hydrogen is placed beside it, the gas l>eing
allowed to bubble through the first until the colour is judged to

be equally intense ; the amount of sulphuretted hydrogen in a
known volume of the gas is thus found, and hence the amount of
carbon bisulphide. Having once got the apparatus started,
gases from several different sources may be tested.
Frof. A. Oppenheim made some remarks on oxyuvilic acid,
which he stated belonged to the aromatic series, and said he

their fellows immediately after his decease, their idea of a future
state being that they become devils after death. They never
laugh, and they! are very noteworthy as being the only savage
race in existence speaking an Aryan language. Their vocabulary
consists largely of words derived directly from the Singhalese;
others indicated an affinity with Pali or Sanskrit, whilst there
remained a considerable residue of doubtful origin. There was
an absence of any distinctly Dravidian element.
In the discussion on these papers, Prof. Rolleston said that
the ethnology and languages of Hindostan were now in pretty
much the same state of fusion as those of Great Britain. Since
the writinqs of Sir George Campbell and others, and the excel-
lent publications of the Indian Government, he had arrived at
the conclusion that the Australioid and not the Mongolian type
was that which formed the substratum all through the outcast
tribes of India: this accorded also with the probabilities of evo-
lution. He believed that the earliest races of mankind were
eminently Australioid, with long and narrow heads. With re-
gard to the Weddas, it was a most interesting question whether
they were really a degraded outcast Sanskrit population. Max
M idler was of that opinion ; and their possession of the bow and

arrow, which no Australioid ever had, tended in that direction.
Their skulls were not Australioid.—Sir George Campbell did not
know that there was any authentic case of degradation of a race.
In this instance the primd facie inference seemed to him to be
that the Weddas were an aboriginal race. Very small tribes
which had been reduced in numbers easily changed their language
under the influence of a more powerful surrounding people.
From the photographs of the Weddas he pronounced their ab-
solute identity in feature with many of the barbarous aboriginal
tribes of India which he had seen, and which were distinctly non-
Aryan. The use of the bow was universally known among the abo-
riginal races of India,which had the same notions about witchcraft,
&c. as the Weddas. He asked for information as to their strength
in the left arm, which Mr. Hartshorne had mentioned, for he had
always supposed that the use of the bow called forth strength in
the right arm.—Mr. Hartshorne said that in his experience of
shooting with the bow, he had found that the great tension in
pulling the bow was on the muscles of the left fore-arm. He was
therefore prepared to find that the Weddas were stronger in the
left arm, and it was so.—Sir Walter Elliot agreed with Sir G.
Campbell as to the aboriginal character of the Weddas, but be-
lieved in the possibility ol great degradation.—Mr. Hyde Clarke
said they had all the appearance of being an aboriginal people.
Their speaking an Aryan language was no decisive reason for
calling them Aryans.

Dr. Leitner gave a graphic summary of the results of his
travels and researches in the Central Asian region to which
he has given the name Dardistan. He gave the following as
the chief results of his investigations:—"First, we have ascer-
tained the existence of a number of languages—one of which,
Chilasi, the object of my mission, is a mere rude dialect—which
were spoken at or before the time that Sanskrit became the 'per-
fect ' language, for no one who can speak any of the derivative
languages of India can class the bulk of the Dard languages
among them. Secondly, the legends and traditions of the Dards
show a more European tone and form than anything we find in
India. Thirdly, by the adoption of the term Dardistan for the
countries between Kabul, Kashmir, and Badakshan, we are driven
to compare a number of races which offer certain analogies, and
which may have a certain history in common since the time of
Alexander the Great's invasion of India. Fourthly, our Govern-
ment now know accurately what they certainly did not know
before 1866, the modern history of the countries bordering
on Kashmir." He found that the dialects in this district,
which were in a highly inflexional state, had been preserved
from deterioration by isolation and other causes. He had very

Samoa, a distance»of 1,360 miles. Half of the party on board
perished from want of food and water. In both these instances
the drifting was from east to west, before the trade winds. A
far more remarkable event occurred in Jan. 1858, during the
prevalence of the violent easterly winds, when a numerous family
of adult natives drifted from Fakaofo, in the U nion group, north of
Samoa, to an uninhabited spot known as Nassau Island ; thence
to Palmerston's Island; and finally to Maugaia, where Mr. Gill
lived; altogether a distance of more than 1,200 miles in a south-
easterly direction. (4) The colour, hair, general physiognomy,
habits, character, and especially the language, of the Polynesians
clearly indicate a Malay origin. This could not be accidental.
Mr. Gill's impression was that long ages »go the progenitors of the
present race entered the Pacific from the S.E. fork ofNew Guinea,
but were driven eastward by the fierce Negrito race. The greatest
distance from land to land, as they pressed eastward, would be
from Samoa to the Hervey group, about 700 miles, which had
been successfully performed by natives in their fragile barks
under Mr. Gill's own observation.
In the subsequent discussion Prof. Rolleston expressed his
opinion that there was little difference between Papuans and

Australoids; the superficial differences were outweighed by
great radical points of resemblance. He referred to the Rev.
S. J. Whitmee's paper in the Contemporary Rcvitw for February
1873 as of the highest value on this question of the origin of the
races of the Polynesian islands. This opinion was diametrically
opposed to Mr. Wallace's.—Dr. Hector described the three
chief race-types among the Maories. The first was rarely met
with except in the extreme south; it was of the same type as the
aborigines of the Chatham Islands, with a distinct dialect, only
comprehensible by old Maories. They had a sloping forehead
and strong muscular ridges on their skulls, which were very
distinct from the great majority of Maori skulls. The other
two types were how pretty well intermixed. One was more
common in the northern extremity of the Northern Island,
having yellow shock hair and high cheek-bones. The third
was the ordinary Maori. He mentioned the fact that the
Maories had a much better knowledge of the natural history
of their country than any people he had ever heard of. The
older Maories had noticed and had distinct names for nearly
all their planis, not merely those that were of use ; and the same
names, with slight modifications, were universally in use
throughout a country a thousand miles in length. They had
generic names by which they grouped plants according to their
affinities in a way impossible to most people who were not
educated botanists. The Veronicas of New Zealand appeared

under a very great variety of external forms, yet they were all
identified by one name.—The Rev. W. Gill, in closing the dis-
cussion, said that difference in shade of colour was not to be
relied upon as a test of difference of race; for he had seen the
most intense blackness produced in Polynesia in those of the
poorer classes who habitually spent much time in salt water,
while the wealthier classes remained of a much lighter hue.

The Anthropological Department has been one of the best

THE SCIENCE COMMISSION REPORT ON
THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE*
IN our last article under the above head we commenced
our analysis of that part of the Commissioners' Re-
port which deals with the Administration of Science. In
our present article we shall conclude our notice of the
Report by stating the chief arguments and opinions of the
witnesses regarding the formation of a Council of Science.
Thus, following the evidence of Sir Wm. Thomson and
Dr. Frankland, to which we have before referred, we
find Dr. Hooker, Admiral Richards, General Strachey,
Dr. Roscoe, Dr. Balfour Stewart, Dr. Sclater, Mr. De la
Rue, Sir H. Rawlinson, and others in favour of a Council,
while the Astronomer Royal, Prof. Owen, Lord Salisbury,
and Lord Derby are opposed to its formation.
Admiral Richards, late Hydrographer to the Navy, is
of opinion that the appointment of a Minister of Science
and of a Council stand and fall together; and thinks
"that the one would not be of very much value without
the other."
Dr. Sclater's idea of the Council is as follows :—
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
"The heads of the different scientific institutions that
are put under the control of the department of science
and the minister of education might form a consultative
body and be called a council of science, and that there
might be certain other members added to assist them in
deliberation, if it were thought necessary, such as repre-
sentatives of the College of Physicians, the College of Sur-
geons, and of the scientific branches of the army and navy.
"Most men of science, I think, see that something of
the sort is imperatively required. All lament the piece-
meal way in which scientific subjects are dealt with by
Government, in consequence of their being subdivided
amongst all these different offices, and of there being
nobody to appeal to upon a question of science, and
therefore I think the proposal to establish such a Council
would meet with universal acceptation amongst scientific
men."
Dr. Hooker, the President of the Royal Society, gives
it as his opinion "that the general proposition, that the
Government should be aided by scientific persons, is an
excellent one, both with respect to the administration of
the existing Government scientific institutions and with
respect to the occasional grants which the Government
may be called upon to make for scientific objects." Like
Dr. Roscoe, he thinksthat the Council should not consist
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
exclusively of scientific men.
Mr. De la Rue considers that the usual permanent staff
of a secretary and assistant secretaries, as suggested
by Prof. Owen, even if they were men of science,
would not be sufficient; [urging as a reason that science
is really now so extensive that one could hardly imagine
any secretary to be so intimately acquainted with every
branch of science as to be able, even with the aid of his
assistant secretaries, to advise, or to point out where to
obtain specific information on every question which
might be brought under consideration. Nor does he
think the Government Grant Committee, a body regarded
with favour by many witnesses, could be so modified as to
render a special Council unnecessary.
Sir Henry Rawlinson regards the nomination of a

Permanent Council of Science as the natural remedy for
the " spasmodic " action on the part of the Government;

membranccr. You have the Observatory at Edinburgh
as part of the University of Edinburgh, and you have
the Observatory at Greenwich under the Admiralty, be-
sides several others. You have eveiy possible variety
of jurisdiction, and, consequently, it seems to me that
you have a great waste of power; there is the School of
Chemistry, and the School of Mines, and the Museum at
Edinburgh, all under South Kensington Museum, and
the Meteorological Department, which is partly under the
Royal Society and partly under the Board of Trade.
There is no possibility of getting any correlation between
those different scientific bodies, and if you are to get
proper unity of administration you must bring them all
under one head, or to one focus. I should recommend
placing them all under a scientific commission or council,
and I should place that council probably under the Privy
Council; but I should make it a body for administering
all questions connected with all the scientific institutions, or
all grants made by the Government for scientific purposes
in the country, and I should give to this council the same
status, with regard to its administration, or very much the

same, that the Indian Council have The
parliamentary head of the department, if he differed from
them in opinion as to their recommendations upon the
scientific questions connected with those institutions, or
any ether that might be founded, should record his differ-
ences of opinion in a minute."
Dr. Siemens would "assemble the heads of depart-
ments at frequent intervals for the discussion of general
questions, and would propose to add to their number such
men as the president of the Ro)al Society, the president
of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and at least one
representative of the two great Universities. This Board
would decide general questions appertaining to the ad-
vancement of science."
We could fill many more columns with evidence
analogous to the above samples. Making due allowance
for the different ways in which a new and complex ques-
tion like this, compounded of scientific, political, and
administrative elements, must present itself to a variety
of minds trained to dissimilar pursuits and habits of
thought, the almost general consensus as to the necessity
of some such advising body as that proposed is most
striking.
Still those who object to the creation of a Council on
various grounds are not wanting, and we now glance

briefly at the evidence of these witnesses.
Sir G. Airy thinks a paid Consultative Council could
not do very much to assist the Government, and that the
Council of the Royal Society would be the best body to
which the Government could have recourse in any
matters of that kind.
Prof. Owen prefers a Minister of Science, with a per-
manent Under-secretary and administrative staff, as in
his opinion the representative of any particular branch of
science on the Board would have too great an influence.
The Earl of Derby is very sceptical either as to the
necessity, or as to the utility, or as to the successful
working of such a Council. One objection he urges is
that if matters for which the head of a department is
responsible are to be referred to the Council, and if
upon those matters the Council is to pronounce an
authoritative opinion, the responsibility of Ministers to
Parliament will be considerably lessened.
In reply to the suggestion that one function of the
Council would probably be to advise the State as to the
application of money for the higher teaching of science

opposition. Whoever will be careful to read the
last public report, and the short but most weighty
statement with which Mr. Simon introduces it to
his chiefs, will see plainly that this kind of opposi-
tion is founded in misapprehension or ignorance.
The information sought is such as may help to inform
the State how to offer most effectual resistance to
the introduction of disease from without, and to the exten-
sion of disease within. It concerns resistance to typhoid
fever, small pox, and many other diseases of well recog-
nised contagious nature, and the possibility of controlling
the extension of diseases less recognised as having like
nature, as for instance what Mr. Simon calls "the tuber-
cular infection." "It aims to be a systematic study of the
intimate pathology of the morbid infections, acute and
chronic."
Mr. Simon in his remarks points out that much of
the study involved is most elaborate and purely scientific,
never immediately convertible to pecuniary profit, but
perhaps, on the contrary, involving heavy cost; not pre-
tending to immediate popular application, but addressing

itself primarily to the deeper scientific requirements of
the medical profession, and therefore in an extreme
degree technical. Studies of this sort cannot be culti-
vated to any adequate extent by private medical investi-
gators, and the scientific investigations set going by the
2,000/. grant have a distinctive intention to supplement
the ordinary resources of private medical observation in
the direction already indicated. The work connects
itself with the objects of preventive rather than with the
objects of curative medicine, and in addition to inves-
tigations into the aetiology of infective diseases, it in-
cludes some very elaborate research concerning normal
standards, histological and chemical, of the tissues in-
volved in the morbid infective processes.
The latest published volume, entitled "Report made
to the Lords of the Council on Scientific Investigations
made under their direction, in aid of Pathology and
Medicine," contains the result of five researches :—(1
Dr. Sanderson's Further Report on the Intimate Path-
ology of Contagion; (2) Dr. Klein's Research into the

Dr. Sanderson's paper is a sequel to a former Re-
port on the nature of infecting agents or contagia, in
which Chauveau's opinion, expressed in the sentence "All
contagia are probably particulate," was supported. The
present paper treats of the infecting agents and morbid
processes in diphtheria, erysipelas, splenic fever, and
relapsing fever. In relation to all of these a mass of
evidence collected from many observers is adduced to
show that vegetable forms are connected with the con-
tagions or with the morbid process. In splenic fever and
relapsing fever organisms of a distinctive and specific
form are declared to be present in the blood; bacterium-
like rods accompanying splenic fever, minute organisms
to which the name of spirilla has been given accompany-
ing relapsing fever. In an "addendum" some observations
of Dr. Letzerich, of Bramfels, Nassau, and of Dr. Oertel,
of Munich, on the inoculation of animals with diphtheric
poison are reported. From these it appears that in
animals receiving the poison (derived from the throat of
a child) by subcutaneous injection, the characteristic
affection of the throat was developed after a few hours,

principles, both phosphorised and nitrogenised. Among
the phosphorised, kephalin and myelin (both of which
contain nitrogen, as well as phosphorus) are new, and are
associated with lecithin. They are described as typical
colloids, of no true solubility, of almost indefinite power
of soaking up water so as to form an imperfect solution(
of feeble chemical activity, of a remarkable readiness to
combine with acids salts and alkalies, and to part with
them on the addition of excess of water. Kephalin and
myelin are stable, lecithin so unstable as to elude proper
analysis. Similarly the nitrogenised bodies, cerebrine
(Miiller's), kerasine, and phrenosine, arc colloids, but of
less perfectly marked type, and less interesting natural
history.
In his summary Dr. Thudichum, speaking of the phos-
phorised bodies, remarks that " we have therefore here a
diversity of affinities such as is not possessed by any
other class of chemical compounds in nature at present
known; and the exercise of these affinities being greatly
influenced by the mass of reagent and the mass of water
which may be present, the interchange of affinities may

phosphorised and consequently of brain matter. This
power of answering to any qualitative and quantitative
influence by reciprocal quality or quantity we may term
the state of labile equilibrium; it foreshadows on the
chemical side the remarkable properties which nerve
matter exhibits in regard of its vital functions."
The volume now under consideration has been pre-
ceded by two volumes, containing a first and second
report by Dr. Klein, on the Lymphatic System and its
relation to Tubercle, a report by Dr. Sanderson on the

dichum on Chemical Changes in cases of Typhus. Re-

and on Infective Inflammations, by Dr. Thudichum on
the Chemical Constitution of the Brain, by Dr. Creighton

Klein on the Contagium of Enteric Fever. The whole

relation to the welfare of the community, as a contri-
bution in aid of preventive medicine, cannot be doubted

that the work is of a kind which can only be set going by
such means as public grants, since it involves a special
training and a special devotion inconsistent with the

a serious regard. The department of the Government
concerned in protecting the country from the invasions of
contagious disease, whether represented by Minister of

up, which forced up the atmosphere to a prodigious
height, where it was chilled and its vapour condensed,
which fell in diluvial torrents, leaving the air so free from
vapour that radiation took place at an enormous rate,
chilling the earth and causing the glacial epoch! He also
concludes that on account of the too great density of air in
the plain, man must have made his first appearance on ele-
vated plateaux, and he accounts in this way for the vene-
ration of high places among the early races. These and
similar speculations, though they may sometimes amuse,
do not detract from the real merit of the work in more
determinable matters.
We reach the substantial part when we come to the
experiments of M. Bert, of which the results are here
given. Small animals were placed in chambers of various
capacities, which were then filled by the same absolute
quantity of air, necessarily at various pressures ; when
the animals were dead, the remaining air was analysed,
and it was found that in the larger vessels the proportion
of oxygen was greater, and this proportion was such that
the total amount of oxygen left was proportional to the

capacity of the chamber. The animals died as soon as
the oxygen by itself was reduced to a density of 4 per
cent, of what it would,be if the whole chamber were filled
with it at the normal pressure—the amount being thus
independent of the quantities of the other gases present.
This being true for any sized chamber, it follows we may
suppose the chamber indefinitely large; and an animal
would die in the open air if the oxygen should have less
pressure by itself than 4 per cent, of 76 millimetres.
Taking the air to have its ordinary 21 per cent, of oxygen,
these experiments would appear to prove that life is im-
possible in air of less pressure than 14-5 mm. The pro-
portion of oxygen, however, seems to be much less than
that which is ordinarily supposed to be small enough to
produce asphyxia. Further experiments were performed,
pointing to the same result. Dogs were so fastened that
they could breathe only from a bag of limited size, and
from time to time the air in the bag and the blood of the
dog were analysed, and it was found that the oxygen in
both decreased simultaneously, though not at the same
rate. These and similar experiments, together with the
fact ascertained by M. Jourdanet, that the blood of
Mexican dogs contains a less proportion than usual of
oxygen, are the proofs offered that the blood cannot be
sufficiently oxygenised for health without a certain amount

of atmospheric pressure.
In all these experiments, however, no allowance is made
for the possibility of the human lungs accommodating
themselves in time to the smaller pressure, so as to
enable the blood to take up a sufficiency of oxygen ; and
this objection is seen by M. Jourdanet, who, after
giving an interesting account of the various evils that
have befallen noted climbers, discusses the question
whether an increased number ol respirations, or an
enlargement of the thorax, could counteract the effect
of the rarity of the air. As to the first, numerous
experiments on himself during his residence in Mexico
have enabled him to verify the law given by Leh-
mann, that the carbonic acid expired is in part con-
stant and in part only variable with the number and mag-
nitude of the respirations ; and he calculates from hence
that, in order to counteract the loss of pressure and dimi-
nution of oxygen by increased respiration, it would require
twenty-four ordinary respirations per minute, which of
course the Mexicans do not make. As to the size of the

To these follow chapters on the influence of mountain
travelling on health, and detailed experiences of the appli-

With the desire of making the work as complete on
the subject as possible, the author has compiled a large

The Royal Ti^er of Bengal: his Life and Death. By
J. Fayrer, M.D. (London: J. and A. Churchill.)
In this small work Dr. Fayrer gives a popular description

of the zoological relationships, anatomical structure, geo-
graphical distribution and habits of the tiger. Accounts
arc also introduced of tiger-hunts, which well exemplify
the dangers to be feared and the precautions to be taken
in the pursuit of that large game, which even under
the most favourable circumstances cannot be followed
without a great amount of risk. The author's con-
siderable Indian experience gives great weight to his
opinions on many of these points, especially with refer-
ence to the nature of the wounds inflicted by the enraged
creature.
Anatomically Dr. Fayrer brings to our notice a point
in the disposition of the claw-bearing or ungual phalanges
of the digits in the cat-tribe, which is not without interest.
In the fore-limbs, as is well known,these bones, when the
claws are fully retracted, bend extremely backwards in
order to allow of the claws themselves being protected
during progression. To so great an extent is this retrac-
tion carried, according to Prof. Owen, that the bone
passes back to the side of the second phalanx in the
same way that the blade of a clasp-knife may be said to
do the same with reference to each literal portion of the
handle. In the hind limb of the tiger, Prof. Owen re-
marks that they are retracted in a different direction,
"viz., directly upon, not by the sides of the second
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
phalanges, and the elastic ligaments are differently dis-
posed." Dr. Fayrer finds that in the smaller Felidse, as
the Ocelot, the hind claws are constructed and retracted
on exactly the same principle as the fore. Such being
the case, either the tiger differs from its smaller con-
geners, or Prof. Owen is wron^. Till Dr. Fayrer proves
the latter, we prefer to assume that the former is the case.
"Contrary to custom, I propose to give him (the tiger)
precedence of the lion. He is generally described as
inferior, though nearly equal, to the so-called king of
beasts; but in size, strength, activity, and beauty he
really surpasses him; and therefore, though he may
neither be so courageous nor so dignified, he is entitled
to the first place—at all events in India." Thus says
our author, and many of his descriptions fully exemplify
all the animal's best points. Nevertheless, though he
may be slightly greater in length, and is perhaps more
active, we considerably doubt his greater strength, and
as the work before us fully proves, we cannot say of him
as a recent writer tells us of the lion, that "it should
always be recollected, before meddling with lions, that if

"Tone " and "Overtone"
In the very favourable estimate of the work I have done in
my translation of Helmholtz, in your number for Sept. 23, I am
aken ra.her severely to task for my use of " Sensations of Tone"
on my title-page, and my refusal to use the expression overtones
in the body of the work. The title was long a matter of
anxious consideration to me, and I have not yet seen my way
to improving it. True, practical musicians, physiologists, and

artists have each their own, very different, technical meanings for
tone. The two last generally use it without an article, and in
the singulir ; but musicians are accustomed to speak of " a tone,"
or of several tones, when they allude to musical intervals. In
common speech, however, all three agree with the outside world
in speaking of a "loud and soft, gentle and angry tone of voice,"
of a " hne-toned instrument," of the "splendid or miserable tone
produced by a violinist," of the "magnificent tones of the
organ." That is, we are all accustomed to use tour, as I have
done on my title, for "a musical quality oT sound." I know no
other single word in English which expresses the same concep-
tion. In the original German, Prof. Helmholtz (and after him
Prof. Tyndall) endeavours to use tone for a " simple tone " only.
Neither have contrived to be consistent in so doing. I have had
to correct the text several times in my translation on this very
point, and instead of using tone for "simple tone" only, which
is a new conception, and clang (in English, a din) for "com-
pound musical tone," which is also a new and not an easy con-
ception, I have invariably used the word tone (except when
distinguished by a capital letter—thus, Tone, for the interval) in
the usual general" sense of the word, and distinguished the par-

very small, the coaling of the melted surface by copper oxide is
comparatively slow, and in melted brass it might not be possible,
from the rapid oxidation of zinc upon the surface, successfully to
observe the same phenomenon. In order to render melted copper
fluid enough for casting, a small proportion of alloy sufficient to
give it almost the colour of brass is required to be mixed with it,

those of gold, opportunities would present themselves similar to

Changes of Level in the Island of Savaii
While feeling some diffidence about setting myself in oppo-
sition to so careful an observer as the Uev. S. J. Whitmee (Nature
vol. xii., p. 291), I cannot allow his statements in regard to
changes of level in the island of Savaii, Samoan group, to pass
altogether unchallenged. In the month of June 1874 I spent
some weeks on the island, during which time I travelled around
nearly the whole of it en foot. Though not a scientific observer,
I was on the look-out for indications of change of level along
the coast, and it is my decided opinion that such indications are
quite as little apparent in Savaii as in Upolu. Mr. Whitmee,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
whom I had the pleasure of meeting on the island, directed my
attention to what he believed to be a line of upheaved cliffs a
couple of hundred yards back from the sea, near Tufu, on the
south side of the island. On examining the place, after
parting from Mr. Whitmee, I particularly observed that the
floor of volcanic rock at the base of the cliffs boie exactly the
appearance of lava that had cooled in the open air. The creases
and ripples left on the surface of the lava in cooling were dis-
tinctly visible, which could not have been the case if the rock had
ever been exposed to the action of the waves. No doubt was
left on my mind that the floor of volcanic rock between the base
of the cliffs and the sea was at one time on a level with the top
of the cliffs, and that it had broken away and sunk several feet,
from some cause which I do not attempt to explain.
I brought away the impression that Savaii was at one time
much .more fully supplied with barrier reefs than at present, and
that recent lava-flows had extended the island out beyond the
reef. So far as my observations extended, where reefs do exist
they are terminated by points or capes of volcanic rock, looking
as if the lava had overflowed and cut off the reef.

The August Meteors.—As previously stated, the
systematic course of observation of the meteors of the
August period, organised by the French Scientific Asso-

success, the atmospheric conditions on the nights of the
9th, loth, and nth having been as favourable as possible at
many of the stations. The greatest number was observed
during the night between the 10th and nth, but this
number varies much in the different accounts so far pub-
lished by M. Leverrier. The Lisbon observers would appear
to have recorded the greatest number, 1,227 meteors having
been noted between ioh. and 15I1. 25m., when the sky
clouded. A table of more than forty tracks, exactly noted,

on the same night, 858 meteors were recorded between
8h. 35m. and 15I1. 40m. At Bordeaux M. Lespiault
remarked that four-fifths of the meteors seen were Perseids,
generally very small, though in a few cases they had con-
siderable brightness and left trains. At Dijon, on a mean
of the three nights' observations, the radiant was fixed
approximately in R.A. 37°, and polar distance 45°, and in
addition to this point, two secondary radiants were
detected, one in R.A 32o°-4, N.P.D. 9i°"8, and the other
in R.A. 33i°o, and N.P.D. 9o°-o. With respect to these
it is remarked that although, by the means, these co-
ordinates appeared to be confused together, yet for each

of the first gToup appearing to be directed towards the

copper axes, characteristic of the "finds" of relics of
"mound builders." The specimens, one of which is here
figured, have unquestionably been hammered out cold,
and shaped from a fragment of the ore, without the aid
of fire in previously refining the mass. The specimen
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
figured measures five inches and a quarter in length, by
three inches in breadth at the cutting end. The opposite
end is square, nearly two inches in width, and somewhat
thinner than the broader portion of the implement, which
is nowhere of greater thickness than one-fourth of an
inch.
The entire surface still shows the hammer marks made
in shaping the hatchet, even to the edge, which now
shows no trace of grinding or polish ; but this may have
been obliterated by the rust; but I am inclined to believe
from close inspection of both specimens, that the edge
originally was a hammered one, and not a ground one;
making the specimen more nearly allied to the " clipped"
jasper hatchets than polished (ground) porphyry axes.
The accompanying specimen is four-and-a-half inches in
length, by two in breadth, is nearly uniform in thickness
about three-sixteenths of an inch, and has a well-defined
edge, which from its slightly wavy outline, and slight
variation in width, I believe to be a hammered, and not
a ground or polished edge.

Darwin has placed in their hands. We see, in fact, no
reason for refusing to welcome any number of hypotheses
and theories on biological topics: let every one make his
suggestion—the more ingenious and original the better—
and let it be taken for what it is worth. If in its author's
or another naturalist's hands it should lead to the dis-
covery of new facts—if it should in a more or less modi-
fied form be established as true—it will bring thanks and
honour to its promoter. If, on the other hand, it should
lead to nothing, should be tested and found neither true
nor suggestive of truth, it will fall to the ground quietly
enough, and do no harm to anybody. This, be it said,
applies only to the publication of such hypotheses within
the scientific area—a totally different and a very grave
responsibility is incurred when an author represents a
hypothesis as an established doctrine, and appeals to the
support of an uninstructed public. The fact is that we
have acquired this freedom of speculation as compared
with the proscription of it in the pre-Darwinian period,
through the circumstance that biological theory has
passed from the theological to the scientific form. To-
day—no matter who its author—a speculation as to the
mode of development of this or that group of animals and
the significance of this or that organ, may be verified or
rejected; no one will attach undue value to it until this

process has been gone through. Formerly it was not
possible to test such speculations; we had in fact no link
by which organic phenomena were made part of the
whole series of phenomena of which science takes cog-
nisance, and biology had no foundation in the so-called
experimental sciences. Hence speculations were liable

like inspiration, by disciples; and on the other hand to
be rigorously and almost puritanically tabooed by a con-
stantly increasing number who, refusing to occupy them-
selves with these vain imaginings, endeavoured to keep
the facts pure and undefiled, waiting for the coming
of an interpreter—who was realised in Mr. Darwin.
The doctrine of organic evolution as elaborated by Mr.
Darwin and his immediate successors has provided us
with a proper scientific framework, and we can now
proceed to build on that by the legitimate methods of
modern inductive science. It will be some time before

another generation must pass; and in the mean time we

led to oppose exaggeration to exaggeration, we cannot
the less feel that there is sound sense and truth in the
general purport of his views.
In the pre-Darwinian period naturalists looked upon
the series of classes and orders of the animal kingdom
as a more or less branched ascending series. The effort
in nearly all classifications was to distinguish the lower
from the higher and to place the groups in their sup-
posed order of merit, as competitors for the highest
rank of organisation. This has led—new that Darwinism
is accepted—to a tacit assumption that the order of
"degree of organisation" which was worked out in the
pre-Darwinian era, is necessarily the order of historical
development ; that consequently the lower forms of any
group which are existing to day, are nearer to the ances-
tral forms of that group than are the more highly organised
forms.
Whilst an exception has been made to this unreasoned
and unchallenged assumption in favour of the parasitic
forms for which the term "retrogressive development"
has been coined, it does not appear to have occurred to

any prominent naturalist, at any rate it has not been
prominently maintained, that the "retrogressive develop-
ment " which all so readily admit for parasites, may be a
very general phenomenon, as widely or more widely dif-
fused as that of "progressive development." To have
insisted on this possibility even to an excess (of which
more below) is the merit of Dr. Anton Dohrn. Dr. Dohrn
has arrived at an appreciation of the possibilities of degra-
dation or retrogressive development, by divesting himself
of all preconceived notions and of all respect for authori-
ties. In his pamphlet he grapples courteously, but fear-
lessly enough, with Von Kaer, Darwin, Haeckel, Gegen-
baur, and for the matter of that by implication with almost
every zoologist of note.
We claim for him, first of all, full liberty to do this
and to launch the hypothesis of general retrogressive
development as a competitor with that of universal pro-
gressive development. It requires but a few words of
explanation and an example, for which Dr. Dohrn has
selected the possible relations of the Ascidians to the
Vertebrata, to show that retrogressive development is not
only a possibility, but must be going on and has been
going on—on a very large scale—and in any doubtful
case is as much entitled to consideration as the hypothesis
of progressive development. A less important portion

of the pamphlet is that which precedes the development
of the author's Hypothesis of Degradation, and illustrates
the application of what he calls the "principle " of the
Succession of Functions. To put it in the form of a
hypothesis it comes to this :—" Organs do not arise de
novo in organisms, but are formed by the gradual change
of function and accompanying change of structure of pre-
existing organs." That this is true, or at any rate that it
is the hypothesis which, according to the "principle of
uniformity," must be preferred to its converse, namely,
"that organs are formed de novo" must be admitted by
everyone. In fact, most of Dr. Dohrn's readers will feel
that there really is not much novelty in this proposition,
since it is already involved in the doctrine of homologies to
a very large extent. Dr. Dohrn admits this in his pamph-
let, but we conceive that his view differs from that im-
plied in the generally recognised doctrine of homologies,
in that the latter is not absolute; it would merely assert
that many or some organs do not arise de novo, but are
lu.med by the gradual change of function and accom-
panying change of structure of pre-existing organs. Dr.

of this single stem is not to be assigned to either chance
or to chemico-physical, but to an " Entwickelungs-gesetz"
yet to be discovered. This, we confess, is to us a disap-
pointing termination to a clever and spirited essay.
Surely Dr. Dohrn would not expect a scientific man to
understand by the word "chance" anything but a peri-
phrasis for the operation of hidden cause. And what can
he expect any law of development to be, if not an expres-
sion of the operation of chemico-physical causes?
As to the original form under which life made its first
appearance, Dr. Dohrn's words would almost lead to the
impression that he believes in the creation of a " type-
form" something like the Cherubim, with an account of
which Archdeacon Freeman favoured Section D of the
British Association when it met at Exeter in 1869. His
language is, however, sufficiently vague to warrant the
supposition that, as an orthodox physical philosopher, he
holds the doctrine of the evolution of organic forms sub-
ject to the larger doctrine of general evolution, and conse-
quently we may suppose that he would hold that the
single stem which has blossomed in man, and from which

all other forms have descended by retrograde develop-
ment, did take its origin from simple protoplasm, which
had naturally been evolved from carbon compounds. If
the animal pedigree did originate from these very simple
beginnings, we suppose Dr. Dohrn would say that all
trace of them is gone, what is simple now in the way of
organisms is not the simplicity of the original stock, but
a simplicity attained by degeneration. We do not see
any reason to accept this hypothesis of universal degra-
dation (man alone being excepted from its influence), any
more than we can see reason to' accept the competing
hypothesis of universal progress. We are very strongly
inclined to think that neither hypothesis can have the
whole field to itself. We should expect to find in some
directions progress, in others retrogression.
The extent to which each of these processes has gone
on in past ages in connection with the family history of
the animal kingdom is the great problem for zoological
research. E. R. L.
THE NEW METAL GALLIUM
THE discovery, by M. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, of a sup-
posed new element in a blende from the Pierrefite
mine in the Argeles Valley, Pyrenees, was made known
in our "Notes" of last week. This element, which the
discoverer proposes to name Gallium, has revealed itself
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
by the following chemical reactions :—¦
The oxide, or possibly suboxide, is precipitated by
metallic zinc from a solution containing chlorides and
sulphates.
In a mixture of the chlorides of the new metal and of
zinc, ammonia throws down the new element first if added
in a quantity insufficient to precipitate the whole of the
metals present. Nearly the whole of the gallium is thus
thrown down in the first fraction.
Under conditions competent to peroxidise the new
metal, the oxide is soluble in excess of ammonia.
Ammonium sulphydrate produces a precipitate insoluble
in an excess of the reagent. The sulphide appears to be
white.
Sulphuretted hydrogen produces a precipitate in pre-
sence of ammonium acetate and excess of acetic acid. In
presence of zinc salts the new substance concentrates
itself in the sulphides first deposited, but six fractional
precipitations were requisite to remove the greatest part
of the zinc sulphide. In presence of hydrochloric acid
no precipitate is formed.

During the last week there has been a goodly talk about
education, and Mr. Cross has come to the front in a most unex-
pected manner, while the modern English Cardinal has been
acting as his foil. Cambridge, too, in the shape of Mr. James
Stuart, has been active at Nottingham, and the world thinks that
the University is active. The truth is, however, that the Uni-
versity is too poor to do anything, and that the Colleges are
simply looking on while a private benefactor is providing both

with those means of teiching which third-rate institutions on the
Continent have possessed to a greater or less extent any time
during the present century. Mr. Cross not only foreshadows com-
pulsion, but he shows that we have now a Minister who knows
the difference between Education and Instruction. "It is not
mere book learning that I am talking of. That is not the object
of these schools. It is the school discipline, the training of the
mind of the child, the teaching him how to teach himself, the
self-control and the self-respect which he gets at school, which
do more for him than all the book learning that you put into his
head." The Cardinal, on the other hand, defines "Secular Edu-
cation" as "secular knowledge," and then adds: "Education
means the full possession and understanding and enjoyment of
the inheritance of faith, which the child has by virtue of his
regeneration in baptism." It is clear that the Cardinal, if he
means anything, confounds instruction with education as suc-
cessfully as ninety-nine out of every hundred who talk on the
subject confound education with instruction.
At a meeting of the Entomological Club of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, Mr. C. V. Riley,
the secretary, read a paper on "Locusts as Food," in which he
gave his own experience in cooking and eating them. On one
occasion he ate nothing else for a whole day. He found them
to have an agreeable nutty flavour, and especially recommended
them deprived of their legs and wing-cases, and fried in butter,

and also spoke very highly of a soup made from them. He
referred to John the Baptist, who had often, been pitied for the
scantiness of his fare, locusts and wild honey, and expressed his
opinion that he was rather to be envied than otherwise. The
writer regarded it as absurd that parties should actually die of
starvation, as some had done in the districts where this locust
plague had prevailed, while surrounded by such an abundance
of nutritious and palatable food.

The animal only survived a fortnight from the date of its embar-

marked disease. No gorilla, exported as such, lias reached

French railways is that Baron Charles Dupin, who published

at full length, but abstained from saying a word about motive-
power. Baron Dupin, a great geometer and [mechanician, de-
clared to the Institute that locomotives could never move, owing
to the weakness of their hold on the rails, and that the use of
horses could not be dispensed with. Baron Charles Dupin's repu-
tation wa* so great that the truth of the statement was taken for
granted, and in the Kcole des Ponts et Chaussc'es, the public insti-
tution where S ate engineers are educated at the expense of the
Government, in a coarse of lectures given after 1830, it was said
tliat horses could never be dispensed with. The advantages of

dilatation of the epidermis of the inside of the perianth, contrac-
tion of the outside of the perianth, &c. The writer of the
article in question endeavours to prove that expansion of the
flowers in the morning is due to a turgescence of the parenchyma
of the flower, brought abcut by heat, certainly; but the same
agent indirectly causes the same flowers to close up again, after
the disappearance of the swelling through evaporation. This,
he contends, accounts for the early closing of flowers under a
high temperature, or in dry soils. We have always understood
that this phenomenon was governed by the hygrometrical condi-
tions of the atmosphere.
The Revue des Eaux et da Fore's, 1875, gives soma statistics of

genous, nor ihave they been for m my centurjes; indeed, they
do not thrive when introduced. According to the celebrated
Danish geologist, M. Forchhausmer, the beech grows best in
the formation which he calls argile caiiloutiuse, or argi.'es a blocs
erratiques; whereas the oak prefers the sable caillouteuse, or sable
d blocs erratiques. An examination of the vegetable remains in
the bogs so common in Denmark reveals the fact that the
earliest forests were composed of pines, followed by the sessile-
fruited variety of the oak, now to a great extent superseded by
the beech, &c It is supposed that the pine forests flourished
during the Aje de la pierre a eclats ; and the oak was at its greatest
development at the commencement of the bronze age.

NATURE
SOME LECTURE NOTES UPON METEORITES
NOWHERE in the "Cosmos" does Alexander von Humboldt
show more vividly his keen appreciation of all the grander
operations of nature than in those passages in which he discusses
the subject of meteors, and in which he gives us a forecast of the
connection of those striking and still not entirely explained phe-
nomena with other celestial spectacles, such as the apparition of
cornets and the fall of meteoiites.
Thus Humboldt dwells with a lingering interest on the subject
of the rrreteoric showers which in their grandest form, on at least
one, and generally en <ome successive Novembers in every gene-
ration, and in a less brilliant degree on every loth of August,
illuminate the sky with countless lines of momentary light. And
while bringing the occurrence of these swaims of meteors with
much vividness before 'our eyes, he treats them as a special
form of the snmc display presented by the single meteor, that,
gliding down the sky, leaves its thread of light to illumi-
nate a few degrees of the great arc described on ihedome of
heaven by the meteor; nor does he hesitate to liuk these pheno-
mena into one scries with those larger mctcoroids that we call
fireballs, and which sometimes light up the whole heavens, and
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
may occasionally be seen over half a continent. And we may go
on with Humboldt to connect with these greater meteors a class
uf still more striking phenomena accompanying the descent gene-
rally out of a dark cloud when seen in daylight, or with a bright
flame, when seen by night, of meteoric stones, heralded by sounds
as of thunder.
Within the last few years the cases of rccuiring periods of
meteoric showers have been considerably multiplied, while these
and the comets have been recognised by astronomers as belonging
to the same order of celestial objects: and we are now enabled
to group the whole of the phenomena we aie considering under a
single category with a confidence far greater than that on which
Ilumboldt built his suimise regarding them.
It is with the meteoric bodies that fall from out of a cloud
when seen by day, and in fiery mass where the light can be dis-
tinguished, and accompanied by detonations like cannon, that
we are going more immediately to denl here; and it may be well
therefore, without recalling the desciiplions ihat may be found
in many treatises of some of the more familiar meteoric falls,
such as those of I.'Aiglc and of Braunau, lo recount the evidence
of e) c-v. itnes=es of these events en other occasion!. The follow-
ing is a contemporary account of the fall of a shower of stones in
the county of Limerick, at Adare, on Sept 10, 1813 :—•
"Friday morning, the loth September, 1813, being very calm
and serene, and the sky clear, about 9 o'clock, a cloud appeared

in the east, and very soon after I Iieaid eleven distinct reports,
appearing to proceed thence, somewhat resembling tl.e discharge
of heavy artillery. Immediately after this followed a considerable
noise not unlike the beating of a large drum, which was succeeded
by an uproar resembling the continued discharge of musketry in
line. The sky above the place whence this noise appeared lo
issue became darkened and very much disturbed, making a hissing
noise, and from thence appeared to issue with great violence dif-
ferent masses of matter, which directed tbeir course with great
velocity in a horizontal direction towards the west. One of these
was observed to descend; it fell to the earth, and sank into it
more than a foot and a half, on the lands of Scagh, in the neigh-
bourhood of Patrick's Well, in the county of Limerick. It w»s
immediately dug up, and I have been informed by those that
were present, and on whom I could rely, that it was then warm,
and had a sulphurous smell. It weighed about 17 Ibs., and had
no appearance of having been fractured in any part, for the whole
of its surface was uniformly smooth and black, as if affected by
sulphur or gunpowder. Six or seven moie of the same kind of
masses, but smaller, and fractured, as if shattered from each other
or from larger one?, descended at the same time with great

measure; it was of a black vitreous colour outside, and of a
greyish yellow inside; it was then of a mouldy texture,
and hardened to the consistence of the present specimens
afterwards.
"Only one stone fell. No rain had fallen for eight days pre-
viously, nor did it for four days after the fall of the stone. It had
been warm all day before, but not much more so than usual. From
mid-day till the time the stone fell (3 P.M.) it was very cloudy
towards the northward; after its fall the thunder ceased, and the
clouds cleared away. No stone of a similar description had ever
fallen near our village before. The pieces of the stone were im-
mediately after carried off by the country people. Our village is
situated on the banks »f the small river, the Foorma. There are
no hills in its vicinity, the nearest being 3 coss (or 6 miles) off."
Finally, we may extract from the contemporary notices pub-
lished in the United States, the more remarkable circumstances
attending the fall of a great number of aerolites at New Concord,
U.S.A. :—
"About fifteen minutes before one o'clock, May 1, i860, the
people of South-eastern Ohio and North-eastern Virginia were
startled by a loud noise The area over which the

explosion was heard was probably not less than 150 miles in dia-
meter An examination of all the different directions
leads to the conclusion that the central point from which the
sound emanated was near the southern part of Noble County,
Ohio
"Twenty-three distinct detonations were heard, after which the
sounds became blended together, and werecompared to the rattling
fire of an awkward squad of soldiers, and by others to the roar of
a railway train. These sounds, with their reverberations, are
thought to have continued for two minutes. The last sounds
seemed to come from a point in the south-east, 450 below zenith.
The result of this cannonading was the falling jof a large number
of stony meteorites upon an area of about ten miles long by three
wide. The sky was cloudy, but some of the stones were seen
first as 'black specs,' then as 'black birds,' and finally falling
to the ground. A few were picked up within twenty or thirty
minutes. The warmest was no warmer than if it had lain on the
ground exposed to the sun's rays. They penetrated the earth
from 2 ft. to 3 ft. The largest stone, which weighed 103lbs.,
struck the earth at the foot of a large oak tree, and after cutting
off two roots, one 5 in. in diameter, and grazing a third root, it
descended 2 ft. 10 in. into hard clay. This stone was found rest-
ing under a root which was not cut off. This would seemingly
imply that it entered the earth obliquely. It is said that other
stones which fell in soft ground entered the earth at a similar

angle. They must have been flying in a north-west direction.
This fact, added to the other facts, that the detonations heaid at
New Concord came lower and lower from the zenith toward the
south-east, and that the area upon which the stones fell extends
with its longer axis in a south-east and north-west direction,
would imply that the orbit of the meteor, of which these stones
are fragments, extended from south-east to north-west. This
conclusion is confirmed by the many witnesses who saw at the
time a luminous body moving in the same direction. It is a fact
of some interest that the larger stones were carried by the orbital
force further than the small ones, and were found scattered upon
the north-west end of the area referred to.
"Prof. Evans computes, from data supplied by several reliable
witnesses, the altitude of the meteor when first seen to range be-
tween thirty-seven and forty-four miles.
"A train accompanying the stones is described as a cone, having
Its base upon a fire-ball. As seen from near Parkersburg its
length was estimated at twelve times the diameter of the bill.
The part next the base appeared as a white flame, but not so
bright as to render the outline of the ball indistinct. About half
way toward the apex it faded into a steel blue.

NATURE
which could be heard forty or fifty miles away? Nay, why
should it explode at all?
One answer is this. The aerolite comes into our atmosphere
from regions in which the temperature, "the cold of space," may
range as low as 140° below zero Centigrade ; and though the
mass, from the absorption of solar heat, would possess a tempera-
ture much above this, it would nevertheless be intensely cold,
anil consequently more brittle than at ordinary temperatures ; and
hence, en its entering our atmosphere, the heat it instantaneously
acquires on its outer portion expands this, and tends to tear
it away, so as to dissever the exterior from the interior, which
continues to be relatively contracted by the intensity of the cold
which the aerolite brings with it from space. The consequence
is, first, that little bits of the stone spring out all over it, leaving
those curious little holes or pit marks which are characteristic of
a meteorite; and eveiy now and then, as the heat penetrates,
larger masses split away, of which interesting evidence is afforded
by the meteorite, for instance, that fell at Hutsura on May 12,
1861. Fragments of this stone were picked up three or four
miles apart; and by supplementing them by a small piece
modelled to fill up one lacuna, one is able to build up again with

much certainty the original meteorite, or at least the portion of
it represented by the fragments of it which were found. Im-
portant portions of this stone are in the British Museum, presented
some years ago by the liberality of that invaluable institution, the
Asiatic Society of Calcutta. Now, it is remarkable that these
fragments, which in other respects fit perfectly together, are, even
on the faces of junction, now coated with a black crust. On the
other hand, another of these fragments not thus coated fits like the
ioriner to a part of the meteorite that was found some miles away
rom it, and is also not incrusled at the surface of fracture. Hence
we can assert that this aerolite acquired after coming into our at
mosphcre a scoriated and blackened surface or incrustation. The
first explosion drove the fragments first alluded to asunder, and
these became at once incrusted on their broken surfaces; but
others that were separated afterwards, probably on the last of the
three explosions, had not sufficient velocity left to cause their in-
crustation in the same manner as was the case with the fragments
previously severed. Now, this successive incrustation of the
fragments of the meteorite confirms the idea that the disruption
of the mass, and the explosions heard for so vast a distance as
Goruckpore (some sixty miles), are parts of the same convulsion;
and sixty miles is by no means an uncommon distance for the
sound of such a meteoric explosion to be heard.
The late \V. von Haidinger (to whom we are indebted for a
collation of the facts and for valuable suggestions bearing on this
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
subject) threw out the notion that what really produced the de-
tonation was not the disruption of the mass (which he held not
to be a sufficient cause for so loud a report) so much as the col-
lapse of the air into a vacuum which, after following the
meteorite as it pursued its rapid course, suddenly ceased to exist
as the velocity of the meteorite became practically reduced to
zero.
But it still would remain to be explained why at one time
more than another this collapse of the vacuum should take place,
or how it could be repeated; of this, however, a sufficient ex-
planation would seem to be afforded by the actual bursting
asunder of the meteorite from the cause before assigned, since
this explosion, by disturbing the conditions on which the per-
sistence of the vacuum depends, would permit the collapse of
the air and consequent detonation.

THE ASTRONOMY OF THE BABYLONIANS
THE astronomical science of the ancient Babylonians
and their pupils, the Assyrians, was neither so
profound nor so contemptible as has often been main-
tained. Now that we are able to read the native
records written in the cuneiform or wedge-shaped cha-
racter, we find that the progress made at a very early
period in mapping out the sky, in compiling a calendar,
and above all in observing the phenomena of the heavens,
was really wonderful, considering the scanty means they
possessed of effecting it. Certainly their astronomy was
mixed up with all kinds of astrological absurdities, but
this did not prevent them from being persistent and keen
observers, whose energy in the cause of knowledge is not
undeserving of imitation even in the present day.
The originators of astronomy in Chaldea, as indeed of
all other science, art, and culture there, were not the
Semitic Babylonians, but a people who are now generally
termed Accadians, and who spoke an agglutinative lan-
guage. They had come from the mountains of Elam or
Susiana, on the east, bringing with them the rudiments
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 07:50 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818376
of writing and civilisation. They found a cognate race
already settled in Chaldea, and in conjunction with the
latter.they builfthe great^cities of Babylonia, whose ruins
still attest their power and antiquity. Somewhere be-
tween 3000 and 4000 B.C. the Semites entered the
country from the east, and gradually contrived to con-
quer the whole of it. It is probable the conquest was
completed about 2000 B.C. At all events, Accadian be-
came a. dead language two or three centuries later, but
as the Semitic invaders owed almost all the civilisation
they possessed to their more polished predecessors, it
remained the language of literature, like Latin in the
Middle Ages, down to the last days of the] Assyrian
Empire.
Astronomy was.included in the branches of science bor-
rowed by the Semitic Babylonians from the Accadians.
Consequently their astronomical records contain many
words which belong to the old language, while most of the
stars bear Accadian and not Semitic names. Even where
the Assyro-Babylonians had a technical term of their own,
like kasritu, "conjunction," they continued to write the old
Accadian word ribanna, of which kasiitu was a transla-
tion, though they probably pronounced it kasritu, just as
we pronounce viz. "namely."
The oldest Chaldean astronomical records of which we
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
know are contained in a great work called " The Observa-
tions of Bel," in 70 books, compiled for a certain King
Sargon of Agane", in Babylonia, before 1700 B.C., and of
which we possess later copies or editions, made for the
Library of Sardanapalus at Nineveh. The catalogue of
this work shows that a great part of it was purely astro-
logical; other books, however, were more scientific. Thus
there was one on the conjunction of the sun and moon,
another on comets, or, as they are called, " stars with a
corona in front and a tail behind," a third on the move-
ments of Mars, a fourth on the movements of Venus, and
a fifth on the Pole-star.* The catalogue concludes with a

began with Aries and the year with Nisan, neither the
Zodiac nor the Calendar of the Accadians could be
earlier than 2540 B.C. This is also indicated by the fact
that even as late as the composition of the " Observa-
tions of Bel," time is calculated in the case of eclipses,
not by the casbu, or "double hour "—a word which is
Accadian, and not Semitic—but by the older division into
three watches. These consisted of four hours each,
beginning at 6 p.m. and ending at 6 A.M., and.they were
called respectively the "evening," "middle,", and " morn-
ing" watches. Something like an accurate measurement
of time was attained by the invention of the clepsydra.
Eclipses of the moon were observed from a very early
epoch ; but numerous^as are the'' records of them in the
great astronomical work of Sargon's Library, the vague
and unscientific way.in which they are recorded renders
them of little value. The usual formula is: "In the
month so and so, on the 14th day, an eclipse takes place,
beginning on the east and ending on the west: it begins
• in the middle watch [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.], and ends in
the morning watch, the shadow being eastward from the

commencement to the cessation of the eclipse." In sub-
sequent times, however, the language of the observatory
reports becomes more precise and the gradual progress of
an eclipse is carefully described. Long before the reign
of Sargon of Agand, the discovery had been made that
lunar eclipses recur after a cycle of 223 lunations, and
records of them incorporated into the "Observations of
Bel" generally begin with the words "According to cal-
culation," or (it may be) " Contrary to calculation, the
moon was eclipsed." One of the most curious tablets
now in the British Museum is one of lunar longitudes,
which seems to have formed part of the great Babylonian
work on Astronomy, but, since it is written in Accadian,
must be older than 2000 B.C. As a translation of it has
not been made before, it is here given in full:—'

magnifying lens at Nineveh indicates that such an instru-
ment may have actually been in use.*
The portion of Chaldean astronomy which was con-
cerned with the planets was unnecessarily complicated
by the habit of naming them from the fixed stars near
which they happened.to be at different'times of the'year,
so that the same planet is often spoken 'of under varying
names. Thus Nibatanv, was properly Altair, but be-
came a very common title of Mars. The number of the
fixed stars observed by the Chaldeans was very great, and
again suggests the use of something more than the naked
eye. The principal stars had individual names, the rest
being included in the constellations to which they be-
longed. In this way the heavens were mapped out long
before the idea of a terrestrial atlas had suggested itself.
The identification of the Chaldean [constellations and
fixed stars is of course a work of considerable difficulty,
but the modern representatives of several of them have
now been determined, and with the help of these and
fresh astronomical texts, there is every reason to hope

COMTE'S PHILOSOPHY
The Positive Philosophy of Augustc Comte, freely trans-
lated and condensed. By Harriet Martincau. In
Two Volumes, 8vo. Second Edition. (London:
Trubner and Co., 1875.)
THE first edition of Miss Martineau's version of the
"Positive Philosophy ¦ was published in the
autumn of 1853. The considerable space of time which
has since elapsed cannot have been due to any defect in
the adapter's work.1 So excellently were the translation
and condensation accomplished by Miss Martineau, that
Comte substituted her two volumes for his own six
volumes, and since Comte's death the work has actually
been retranslated into French. It does not give us a
great idea of the demand for Comte's works in England,
when we find that twenty-two years intervene between
the first and second editions. At last, however, the work
is re-issued in two handsome volumes, but we are not in-
formed that any alteration at all has been made either in
the matter or language of the work, and I have not been
able to detect a difference even in a word. The appear-

ance of this new edition nevertheless affords an oppor-
tunity for a few remarks upon the value and pretensions
of the " Positive Philosophy."
It has been asked "What's in a name?" As regards
the positive philosophy, it may be answered that there is
a great deal in the name. The name Positive is an
admirable question-begging epithet. Everything which
Comte wished to stamp with his approval, and make a
part of his system, he called positive, and a formidable
list of new names was invented. We have Positive
* A broken tablet I.have come across seems to record a transit of Venus
across the sun. It is to be hoped that Mr. Smith will before long succeed in
bringing to England the remainder of the Kouyunjik Library. At present
a tablet is often broken off at its most interesting part, while the correspond-
ing fragment is still lying under the soil on the banks of the Tigris.
Philosophy, Positivism, Positivity, Positive Method,
Positive Polity, Positive Morality, and even Positive
Practices. It would be much more correct to say
Comte's Philosophy, Comtism, Comte's Method, Comte's
Polity, Comte's Practices, because I believe it is impos-
sible to attribute any invariable meaning to the word

NATURE
doubt that Comte possessed a remarkably extensive and
generally accurate knowledge of mathematics, astronomy,
and many portions of physics and chemistry, as deve-
loped in his day. The first part of his work is therefore
comparatively free from objection, and consists to a great
extent of an interesting and able review of the progress of
physical science.
Incidentally I may remark, that Comte,'while continu-
ally sheltering himself under Lord Bacon's great name,
appears to have known little or nothing of Bacon's works.
If there was one thing which Comte abjured, it was the
inquiry into causes, whereas Bacon quotes approvingly
the old dictum that" truly to know is"to know by causes/
Every reader ot the "Novum Organum " must be aware
that Bacon deals not only with causes, but with still
vaguer ideas, Forms, Natures, Essences, terms so meta-
physical that even the editors of Bacon hardly pretend to
make out clearly what they mean. The following is a
characteristic extract from the second book of the "Novum
Organum" (Aphorism iv.):—" The true form is such that
it deduces the given nature from some source of essence

which is inherent in things, and is better known to nature,
as they say, than Form is. And so this is our judgment
and precept respecting a true and perfect axiom for know-
ledge, that another nature be discovered which shall be
convertible with the given nature, and yet be a limitation
of a more general nature, like a true genus." It is
possible that Bacon knew what he meant, but his own
employment of his "true and perfect axiom" was no
more happy than I hold Comte's application of his
positive method to be.
It is of course impossible to show in a single brief
article how crude and unscientific were Comte's results
when he applied his method to new fields [of research,
especially in Sociology. One of his supposed greatest
discoveries was the philosophical law of the succession of
three states : the primitive theological state, the transient
metaphysical, and the final positive state. This is one
of those vague and hasty generalisations which have the
worst scientific vice of being incapable of precise verifica-
tion. The theory can be stretched, like india-rubber, to
cover any difficulties. If we object that the Hebrews
were from the earliest historical times Monotheists, and
have so continued to the present day, we are told that
they were prematurely monotheistic, and are left to
imagine that they will ultimately become positivists.

What sufficiently condemns Comte's laws of evolution is
that they led him away from the doctrines of evolution as
now established by Darwin and Spencer, and their fol-
lowers. Comte was well acquainted with Lamarck's views,
which he discusses in Book V. chap. 3, coming to the
unfortunate conclusion (vol. i. p. 345) that in every view
Lamarck's conception is to be condemned, and "that
species remain essentially fixed through all exterior varia-
tions compatible with their existence." In the beginning of
the fifth chapter of the sixth book, too, we find a passage
which entirely cuts Comte off from any share in the
sociological doctrines of Spencer. "Gall's cerebral theory,"
he says (vol. ii. p. 10$), "has destroyed for ever the meta-
physical fancies of the last century about the origin of
man's social tendencies, which are now proved to be
inherent in his nature, and not the result of utilitarian
considerations." It is highly remarkable that, though the
germs of the new philosophy of evolution had been put
afloat by the elder Darwin, Lamarck, Malthus, and others,
both Comte and his admirer, John Stuart Mill, entirely
failed to appreciate their value.

that in all countries in which up to the present time
systems of storm warnings have not been organised, steps
leading to such an organisation should be taken as soon

lopment of the system as regards the principles on which
it is based, and its practical application to other public
interests than those of commerce and navigation.
The Maritime Conference which met in September
1874 did some goodwoik towards securing for meteorology
greater exactness and uniformity in observations made
at sea—not the least important consideration being the
number of countries represented at the Conference, all of
which, it may be inferred, will be guided by the decisions
arrived at. Of the improvements effected on the Brussels
Abstract Log may be noted the recording of the direction
and force of the wind as at the time of observation, and
not as estimated for a certain number of previous hours,
and the recording of the upper and lower clouds in separate
columns. The notation of clouds from o, a clear sky, to 10,
an entirely clouded sky, is also an improvement as being in
accordance with the procedure now adopted on land. As
regards the discussion of ocean statistics, the decision is
in everyway admirable, viz., that the observations and
results be published in such a manner that every foreign
institute may be able to incorporate them with its own
observations'and results; that, to this end, the number of
observations, as well as the means deduced from them,
be preserved for single degrees square, and that, whatever
charts be'published, the results for single degrees square

be printed in a^tabular form.
In the proposed;English instructions" for keeping the
log, we regret to see it stated that for all except wind
observations it[is] sufficient to observe at the four-hourly
periods, viz. at 4, 8/12, a.m. and P.M. A strong recom-
mendation should have been'made to make the 10 a.m.
and p.m. observations, particularly with the view of
arriving at a correct knowledge of the distribution over
the ocean of the daily barometric fluctuation which is of
so great importance in its connection with atmospheric
physics. Since by the hours recommended, no systematic
observation will be made from 8 to 12 a.m. and p.m., the
two daily maxima of atmospheric pressure will remain
wholly unobserved, even approximately.
The box for protecting the thermometers on board,

the louvres being 'single andTtoo wide apart to afford the

A Manual of the Mollusca. By S. P. Woodward. Third
Edition. (London: Lockwood and Co., 1875.)
In noticing a third edition of the late Mr. S. P Wood-
ward's well-known " Manual of the Mollusca," our object
is only to indicate wherein it differs from its predecessors.
The body of the work is unaltered; whilst the new editor,
Mr. Ralph Tate, in order to bring the work up to the
present state of our knowledge, has added an appendix,
containing the description of those recent and fossil genera
which, cither from more recent discovery or oversight, are
not to be found in it. This appendix, with its separate
index, occupies eighty-five pages, and is illustrated with
twenty-seven woodcuts, including drawings of Clydonites
costatus, Cochlocerasfischcri (Hauer), Kucyclus goniatus
(Desl.), Nucleospira ventricosa (Hall), &c. Its separate
existence we do not object to, on account of the expen-

sive typography of a work of the kind; nevertheless, the
outlay involved in an incorporation of the two indexes
into a single whole would have been fully made up for by
the extra facility of reference afforded, and the diminu-
tion in the chance of any additional remarks on previously
described genus being overlooked. In the preface to the
second edition, which is retained in that under notice, it
is remarked that "the chapter on Tunicata has been
omitted, since they ate more nearly allied to the Polozoa
than to the Mollusca proper, and since the Molluscoidan
group would have made the work inconveniently bulky."
Such being the case, we cannot help asking why the
Brachiopoda are not also removed. Is it not because
they have shells, whilst the Ascidians are deficient in in-
destructible parts; not, by the way, that Ascidians are
Molluscoidan now-a-days. Additional remarks will be
found on the nature of Bclcmnites; that Crioccras must
merge into Ancyloccras is shown to be certain; the genera
Vcrmetus and Siliquaria are placed in a family by them-
selves, at the same time that their differences from the
mimetic Scrpulidx are explained. Severe.1 of the fami-
lies are re-arranged, at the same time that the newly added
genera are introduced. The work with the appendix is
as accurate a representation of the state of conchology in
1871 as was the first edition on its publication. We put

third edition and the second, which has latterly been
been bound up with Mr. Tate's appendix in exactly the
same form as it appears in the newly produced work.

Oceanic Circulation
I have just read Dr. Carpenter's letter in Nature (vol. xii.
p. 454) in reference to my paper on the Challenger's crucial test
of the wind and gravitation theories of oceanic circulation, read
before the British Association, and am somewhat astonished at
the nature of the objections which he advances.
"The doctrine," says Dr. Carpenter, "to which he (Mr. Croll)
applied his test, was not mine, but a creation of his own. For
his whole argument was based on the assumption that the ocean
is in a state of static equilibrium; whereas the theory I advocate
is, that the ocean never is and never can be in a state of equi-
librium, so long as one part of it is subjected to polar cold and

takes place loculicidally, and the three dark-brown seeds, one in
each cell, are exposed to view. It is at this stage that the phe-
nomenon in question may be observed. The pressure exerted by
the smooth sides of the somewhat obconical capsule against the
equally polished surface of the calyx-tube occasions the rupture
of the capsule from the base of the calyx, and its more or less
rapid expulsion into the air with its three seeds. The latter,
which are at this time free within the cells of the capsule,
are carried to greater distances on account of the smaller
amount of resistance they offer to the air by reason of their shape
and weight; the action, in fact, being not altogether unlike that
of the discharge of a cartridge and its contents from a rifle. The
suddenness oi the explosion depends very much on the state of
the atmosphere at the time. On a hot day I have observed
several instances of spontaneous discharges, whilst a slight
touch only was necessary for the explosion of the remaining
capsules whose dehiscence had already commenced. Many of
the seeds were observed adhering to the upper leaves and calyx-
segments, which are thickly covered with glandular hairs of a
remarkably viscid nature. Contact with these moist bodies very
soon induces the outgrowth of those curious and beautiful spiral

hairs for which the seeds of this and a few other plants are
remarkable, and thus they become doubly secured by adhesion.
I have noticed in some cases when seeds adhere to the flat surface
of a viscid leaf, that this outgrowth assumes a definite outline
extending all round the seed in the form of a flat membranous
expansion, and these, on removal, recall forcibly the appearance
of ordinary winged seeds, like those of Lepigonum marginatum,
for instance. Can this attachment be of any use to the seeds or
to the plant itself by feeding on the nitrogenous products of their
decomposition? Although I have observed a few of these
attached seeds undergoing partial decay, yet, from the nature of
their hard homy perisperm, it is not reasonable to suppose that
it can take place to any great extent, unless the viscid secretion
from the glands is able to render this substance sufficiently
soluble for the purpose. If, however, a certain proportion do
become sacrificed for the good of the plant, we can understand
the object not only of the delicate spiral hairs for ensuring firm
attachment, but also that of the explosive process, by means of
which a certain number of seeds are conveyed beyond the reach
of the viscid surfaces, and falling to the ground, are available for
the reproduction of the plant. Saxifraga tridactylites might be
mentioned as another instance of a viscid plant with the habit
of retaining the seeds on its glandular parts; the much larger
quantity, however, produced by this latter plant in proportion to
what can be required for reproductive purposes would seem to

do away with the necessity for any sudden mode of expulsion.
Like most plants with sticky glandular hairs, the viscid parts of
this Collomia may be seen covered with small insects in various
stages of decomposition.
It might be asked, "What advantage can it be (or an
annual plant to feed on its own seeds, the production of
which is the completion and, in a certain sense, the object
of its existence?" I would suggest, though with diffidence,
the possibility of certain annuals being raised by such means
to a higher state of existence as biennials or perennials, in
which condition they might or might not require the continued
assistance of glandular hairs or other such contrivances. This
might explain the occurrence of hairs on certain parts of plants
either constantly present or at particular times of their life;
such, for Instance, as those on the first leaves of the turnip plant,
and many other examples could be given, in the case of which we
might suppose that the possession of such hairs, or whatever
they may represent, have ceased to be required.
There does seem to be some sort of general relation as to the
degree of hairiness between annuals, biennials, and perennials,
and which often becomes apparent during the development

Scalping
Mr. Charles C. Abbott, in Nature, vol. xii. p. 369,
wishes to learn what other men, if any, besides the North
American Indians, have the practice of scalping among
them. The question is answered in Southali's "Recent
Origin of Man," chap. ii. p. 40. "In this connection wc
may mention that the custom of scalping is not peculiar to
the American Indians. Herodotus mentions that it was one of
the most characteristic practices of the ancient Scythians. But
this is not all: it is stated that the practice prevails at this day
among the wild tribes of the frontier in the north-eastern district
of Bengal. The Friend of India, commenting on this state-
ment, adds: 'The Naga tribes use the scalping-knife with a
ferocity that is only equalled by the American Indians, and the
scalps are carefully preserved as evidences of their prowess and
vengeance over their enemies. On the death of a chief, all the
scalps taken by him during his warlike career are burned with
his remains.'" G.Peyton

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
The Double Star 2 2120.—As mentioned last week,

Herculis, near the 63rd. Very unequal. L. r. ; S. r. Dis-
tance 11" 53"'. Position 47° 48' n. following."
There is a contradiction here; a position "4 degrees
from 8 towards t Herculis," which pretty well agrees with
that of 2 2120, would not be near 63 Herculis, which is
little more than 1° s.p. 8.

MAYER'S METHOD OF OBTAINING THE
ISOTHERMALS "OF THE SOLAR DISC
'"THE short notice which I published of my " Discovery
¦*¦ of a method of obtaining thermographs of the iso-
thermal lines of the solar disc " was so concisely written
that the precautions which are necessary in this new
method of research were omitted ; but as the republication
of my paper in Nature (vol. xii. p. 301) and in other Euro-
pean journals may induce those engaged in astronomical
physics to try the process, I think it proper that I should
call attention to some very important experimental condi-
tions to be fulfilled before accurate results can be reached.
1. Special precautions must be taken to prevent
currents of air from acting on the film of double iodide.
2. If the image of the sun be formed on the blackened
side of the paper, it is absolutely necessary that uniformity
should be given to this coating of lamp-black. So diffi-
cult is this to achieve that I have generally formed the
sun's image directly on the film of iodide. Slight irregu-
larities in this film do not appear to affect the form of the
isothermals; but the latter follow irregularities in the
smoked surface.
3. The most important, and indeed absolutely essential,
condition in these experiments is that the image of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
sun shall be formed on a truly horizontal surface; for the
centre of gravity of any isothermal formed on an inclined
surface is always above the centre of the sun's image and
in a vertical plane passing through this centre. Hence all
isothermals thus formed are very excentric when referred
to the sun's centre. They are also elliptical. The
accompanying figure gives isothermals obtained on an
inclined surface. N S is the solar axis. On obtaining
these same isothermals on a horizontal surface they were,
as near as could be seen, circular and concentric with the
sun's image.
Of the influence of an inclined surface in displacing the
isothermals there can be no doubt, and the same action
has effected all of the results which have been obtained
in the employment of thermopiles in connection with the
sun's image received on screens attached to equatorial
telescopes. This displacement would mislead an observer,
and would cause him to be of the opinion that there existed
a decided difference of temperature between the north and
south solar poles, and between the portions of the peri-
phery of the sun's image near the poles and near the

of sentiment in dealing with them as pure mathematics'
In those fields of inquiry where pure mechanics can no
longer guide us, the crudest hypotheses take root and
grow : witness the wild dreams of the astronomers of the
seventeenth century. Now the department of mechanics
to which falls the exposition of the gyratory movements
of liquids and gases, and on which depend exactly the
atmospheric phenomena we speak of, does not yet exist,
except as a first and most imperfect draft.
Taken thus at unawares, as it were, and compelled to rely on
evidence altogether illusory and suggesting unhesitatingly
the idea of aspiration on a vast scale, modern meteorology
strives at least to free itself from conflicting impossibilities.
Thus, instead of making the waterspout suck up water in
its ordinary form, it is assumed that this water is first
blown into spray by the conflict of the winds at the base
of the waterspout, and then whirled aloft in this form. A
curious experiment was even made in 1852 at Washing-
ton, for the purpose of showing that this is the case. The

following account of it is taken from the "Fourth Me-
teorological Report to the Senate of the United States,"
by Prof. Espy :—
"The effect produced by the ascent of a column of air
in a narrow space may be thus shown :—If we produce a
simple rarefaction of two or three inches of mercury r
the upper part of a vertical tube a few feet in length n-:
five inches in diameter, by putting it in connection wr^
the central opening of a machine in full blast, the air wii:
rush into the tube by the lower orifice with a speed pro-
portional to the square root of the diminution of pressnrf.
or about 240 feet per second for an inch of motor;.
Then, if a basin filled with water is placed under UK
opening of the tube and the surface of the water b:
brought to about 2j inches from the end of the tube, th-
water in the basin will be quickly sucked up and ascad
the tube, and produce in miniature what takes place in i
waterspout. If the tube is glass and of the same dimea
sions, the water will be seen rising in spray in the form o!'
an inverted cone. This experiment was made in a foundr,
at Washington in the spring of 1852, in the presence :>:
Prof. Henry and several distinguished members of Coa-
gress."
It is singular that none of those present at this expiri-
ment remarked the difference there is between a tub; at
metal or of glass and an almost ideal tube whose bousi

ing surface is only thin insubstantial vapour. The e*pe-
FIG. 6.
riment is, however, a proof of the resoluteness with which,
in this age even, a belief in the powerful upward suction of
waterspouts is entertained.
In order that an ascending current may take place in
the atmosphere for some seconds, it is essential that a
mass of a lower stratum of air be heated a little more
than the air surrounding it. It thus becomes lighter than
the layers above it, and consequently rises. In ascend-
ing, however, it expands and cools, and soon all further
ascent is arrested at a height where the pressure and tem-
perature equal the pressure and temperature of the
ascending mass. It is, moreover, replaced from below by
air of a lower temperature from all sides. Up to this
point there is little, if any, resemblance to a waterspout;
there is, however, already the beginning of a movement
of ascension, and by means of some new additional hypo-
theses the phenomenon is completed by giving to it the
essential characteristics of a real waterspout.
Moist air ascends, it is affirmed, more quickly and to a
greater height than dry air. Prof. Espy maintains even
that it will rise .till the limits of the atmosphere be reached

NATURE
as this excess of temperature is felt at the same time over
a wide area, the lower stratum of air rises bodily, so to
speak, over the whole region. Now there is no reason
why the air should begin to ascend at one place rather
than another in the region where the air is perfectly
calm; there will be then between the lowest aerial
stratum and the one immediately above it a sort of equi-
librium, but an equilibrium so essentially unstable that
the slightest accident, such as the striking of a light or
the flight of a bird, instantly destroys it. As soon as the
charm is broken at some point the lower air will there
ascend, and as it is charged with moisture it will continue
to rise in an ascending column to the higher regions of
the atmosphere. In rising, this air will leave a vacuum
below it, towards which will rush the air of a lower
stratum. This will in turn follow the first in its ascent,
and it is seen that gradually the air of this highly heated
lower stratum will flow from all sides with an accelerating
speed towards the pathway opened by the first ascending
puff of wind. As this propagation of the horizontal
movement extends wider and wider over the heated

stratum, the air which arrives at the place where ascend-
ing currents have set in will be of the temperature required
to keep up the indraught. Further, the vis viva of the
air currents about the narrow space where the equilibrium
was first disturbed will acquire a force capable of pro-
ducing, a short distance from the point towards which
they all converge, very considerable mechanical effects.
Then, if the whirlwind advances on the sea, its surface,
lashed on all hands by the converging winds, is thrown
into a state of ebullition; the spray is drawn up in an
ascending column and whirled aloft, however slight may
be the spiral form assumed by the horizontal converging
currents. The air which rises so violently in the water-
spout will be thrust higher and higher, as we have just
seen, by the force constantly called into play by the con-
densation of the vapour into cloud and rain; at length it
reaches the high regions of the atmosphere, where it
expands and swells into a dense cloud of enormous
dimensions. This, then, is the theory of aspiration.
Before a physicist reasons in this way he ought to be
well assured beforehand that the facts are as he supposes;
in other words, that waterspouts suck up by a vast upright
tube the air and the water of the lower strata. Otherwise
he would net fail to remark that if the equilibrium, emi-
nently unstable, which he assumes to be established,

comes to be destroyed at any point, it would be quickly
destroyed over the whole extent of the lower stratum, the
different parts of which would then rise freely, each in its
place successively, over the small space required for the
re-establishment of the equilibrium of the atmosphere. If,
in support of any other theory, a similar mechanical com-
bination were proposed to him, he would reject it without
hesitation, and say—in order that such phenomena can
take place, in order that the lower air should flow horizon-
tally towards a particular orifice and then rise vertically
through this orifice, it would require to be forced
to do so by some sort of indefinite but solid boarding
placed over the lower stratum of air and pressing
on it with all the weight of the atmosphere. If a
hole be made in the boarding, the air will pass through
it; but even in this case, its ascensional force deter-
mined by the slight difference in density between the
layers on each side of the boarding will not be great,
and the column of air issuing through the orifice will
rise to no great height. In no conceivable case can it
ever exhibit the terrible and destructive force of water-

ascending air, when it has reached the elevated regions
of the clouds, could not be diverted above by upper cur-
rents so as to assume the form represented in Fig. 8 ; for
these upper currents could no more displace the focus ol
aspiration than they could move a locomotive by deflect-
ing the column of smoke which issues from it. (2) The
mechanical effects will be very limited, because the aspir-
ing force being measured by a few millimetres of mercury,
were the end of the suction-tube to be plunged into a
river or the sea, the water would be raised there a few
centimetres. Moreover, at the instant when the extre-
mity of the tube reaches the ground or the water, the air
ceases to flow into it and fails any longer to keep the
ascending column together, and thus all mechanical
action ought to disappear at this moment. Further, it is
evident that if the phenomenon has its origin in a per-
fectly calm stratum of air where not a breath of air is
felt, the element of mechanical work, that is to say the
force or the motion, fails altogether, or becomes reduced
to a feeble ascensional tendency in any stratum of air
that may have acquired over the place an abnormal

excess of a few degrees of temperature.
Compare now with the facts, these two conclusions drawn
from the theory. It would be difficult to find a disagree-
ment more complete. Everyone is aware of the ravages
produced by hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, and even
simple waterspouts and whirlwinds—ravages which imply
an enormous development of mechanical force. Then,
everyone knows that the peculiarity of all cyclones is to
possess a movement of translation, often very rapid, which
the theory of centripetal aspiration denies to them. Of
all waterspouts hitherto observed, only one instance of a
stationary one has been recorded; and even the sta-
tionary- character in this exceptional case may have been
not real but only apparent. As regards tornadoes, all
those that traversed the United States since 1811 were
propagated onwards with a speed varying from four or
five to twenty metres a second. The well-known water-
spout of Monville, in France, swept over a league in less
than four minutes, or at a rate of about twenty metres
per second. At such rates typhoons and cyclones, without
exception, also advance ; their movement of translation is
usually increased as they proceed into higher latitudes,
and varies from three to eighteen nautical miles an hour,
or from two to ten metres per second.
It has been said by the advocates of the theory of aspi-

ration as applied to hurricanes, that if the converging
currents are stronger on one side than on the other, the
centre of aspiration, that is the base of the waterspout,
will be displaced in the direction indicated by the stronger
currents, as shown in Fig. 9. But why this difference of
speed, especially over the sea, where there are no ine-
qualities of surface over which the different winds blow?
The velocity with which air free to move rushes into a
suction-tube is determined by the amount of the suction
force; if the movement be impeded on one side of the
orifice, the air will enter by the other with a determined
velocity, [but not with a velocity tripled or quadrupled.
Moreover, in order that an excess of velocity of twenty
metres per second on one side of the centripetally flowing
currents could communicate a like velocity to the onward
march of the waterspout, it would be necessary that a
wind of the force of a terrible tempest blew in that direc-
tion exceeding by a velocity of twenty metres per second
the contrary wind. This is scarcely compatible with the
absolute calm which ordinarily prevails round water-
spouts, tornadoes, and even typhoons.

rapidly over the various regions and departments, indicates the
relative proportion of notable men belonging to each, and the
particular intellectual product in which each has been most fer-
tile. As might be expected; the north, particularly the basin of
the Seine, which includes Paris, the great centre of population,
is the richest. Seine-et-Oise, l'Aisne, Seine-Infcrieure, Calvados,
Champagne, are also marked by a deep tint. In the east,
Alsace and Lorraine—which in this respect may yet be considered
French—Burgundy, especially the Cote d'Or, Doubs, Lyonnais,
and French-speaking Switzerland, all stand out prominent In
the south, Isere, Bouches-du-Rhone, Hc'rault, Haute-Garonne,
Gironde, are the most remarkable. The west, as a whole, is
but slightly tinted, notable exceptions being Ille-et-Villaine,
Charente-Inferieure, and to some extent Maine-et-Loire and
Finistere. In general, however, Brittany, whose inhabitants
have many other noble qualities, does not show any great
eminence from an intellectual point of view. This M. Cort-
ambert is inclined to attribute to the fact that the Bre-
tons are still to a large extent Celtic; and it is noteworthy
that the centre of France, where also the same element
is still strong, is also comparatively poor in eminent intel-

lectual products. With regard to the particular kind of intel-
lectual product for which each district is noted, M. Cortambert
finds that the north is specially fertile in poets, claiming such
names as Malherbe, Corneille, Racine, Moliere, Boileau, La
Fontaine, Voltaire, Beranger, De Musset ; while in science it
has produced such names as La Place, Elie de Beaumont, De-
lambre, Ducange; also not a few men eminent as painters,
warriors, musicians, historians, and a large proportion of geogra-
phers. From the east come many men who have a world-wide
fame in the natural, physical, and medical sciences—Button,
Cuvier, Daubenton, Berthollet, Andre Ampere, Jussieu, Bichat,
Recamier, Saussure, Bonnet, De Candolle, Agassiz, and others;
in other departments also, specially in literature and art, this
region has been fertile in great names. The south stands out
prominent in the region of orators, but has also produced such
men as Fermat, Legendre, Arago, Borda, Montesquieu, Mon-
taigne, Tournefort, and Adanson: Brave sailors and celebrated
voyagers are the special product of the west. In Brittany and
the Centre, philosophy seems to dominate; to the latter belong
Tascal and Descartes, and the daring humourist Rabelais. Al-
together M. Cortambert's researches in this direction are of
special interest, and will be of real value if he connects the results
above indicated, as he states he intends to, with the nature of
the physical and ethnographical characteristics of the various
regions which he has surveyed.

kting animal matter, as stated by many observers in this and
other countries. He says that so far as Pinguicula longi/olia
and Drosera rotundifolia are concerned, at least, he believes that
the glutinous excretions of their leaves simply hasten decomposi-
tion, which is moreover attended by the usual concomitant phe-
nomena. In very early stages he found monads, bacteria, the
mycelium of various fungi, and other conditions of putrefaction.
So far as the action of the mucus on the entrapped insects and
on coagulated albumen is concerned, he affirms that it is similar to
that of pure water, sugar-water, and the honey-secretions taken
from the flowers of Acchmea nudiflora. Nevertheless he admits
having seen all the admirable contrivances for catching and re-
taining insects.
Mr. G. M. Dawson, F.G.S., has just issued a'report to the
Canadian Government, on the geology and resources of the

Woods, S.E. of Lake Winnipeg, and the Rocky Mountains ; in
other words, of the western portion of the boundary of British
America. Much of the country traversed had been previously
quite unknown, geographically as well as geologically, which
fact adds greatly to the importance of the report, the bulk of

which is devoted to the account of the Cretaceous and Tertiary
strata of the plains between the Rocky Mountains, as they are
constituted at the boundary, and the Lake of the Woods. The
Survey of the United States Government to the south of the
above-mentioned region, when taken in conjunction with that
under notice, forms a vast addition to geologic knowledge.
Among the most important results arrived at is the discovery of
beds which seem to gap over the apparently considerable interval
between the Cretaceous and lower Tertiary periods.
The following interesting statistics on the libraries of Europe
are taken from M. Block's recently published "Statistique de
la France comparee avec les divers pays de l'Europe" :—Paris
has six great libraries belonging to the State and open to the
public. Outside Paris there are in France 338 libraries which
possess more than 34 million volumes; of this number 41 are
open in the evening. Great Britain possesses 1,771,493
volumes, or six vols, to each 100 per sons of the popula-
tion (this must surely refer solely to the British Museum
library). Italy has 117 volumes per 100 inhabitants. In
France there are 4,389,000 volumes, or 117 per 100 persons;
in Austria, 2,488,000 vols, or 6'9 per 100; in Russia, 852,000
vols., or I "3 per 100 ; in Belgium, 509,100 vols., or io-4 per 100.
Of all countries, France possesses the greatest number of volumes,
and Paris alone has one-third of them in its libraries. Since
1865 students' libraries have been formed over nearly the whole
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of France. Since that year these libraries have increased from
4,833, containing 180,854 volumes, to (in 1870-1) 13,638, con-
taining 1,158,742 volumes.

will dissolve meteoric iron out of it; but the remainder or the
mass will, after this treatment, in most cases, crumble into a
granular powder, showing that the cohesion of the mass is not
like that of an ordinary terrestrial rock. Some aerolites, again,
will even crumble in the fingets without previous treatment.
The rocks to which they bear the nearest resemblance, in
respect of their mechanical structure, among the products of oar
volcanoes, are some volcanic bombs, and, as regards several of
the aerolites, certain kinds of volcanic tufa.
Now, in examining these bodies more closely, the first thing that
calls for attention is that they are composed entirely, or almost
entirely, of crystalline substances; and that matter thus coming
from regions beyond our world crystallises in the same way, and
is obedient to the same law, as matter which crystallises on
the globe.
Sections of meteorites cut thin and ground down to transparent
slices, when examined by means of polarised light, are seen to
be crystallised throughout; the crystalline character of the
substances being evidenced by the interference tints which colour
the different crystals of which the sections are made up.
Another characteristic of many meteorites, in which they differ

from ordinary terrestrial rocks, is what has been termed by
Gustav Rose their chondritic structure. The minerals in these
are found to be more or less aggregated in little spherules, which
are distributed in different degrees of abundance in different
meteorites through the ground-mass of the stone.
Sections of chondritic meteorites show them to consist in some
cases almost entirely of spherules. Such is the case with the
Pamallee aerolite, of which the most varied groups of spherules
may be seen assembled in a single section. Some of these
spherules are encased, as it were, in minute shells of metallic
(nickeliferous) iron, or of such iron mingled with a kind of
pyrites peculiar to meteorites, an iron sulphide termed troilite,
constituted by an equivalent of sulphur combined with one equi-
valent of iron. Minute granules of troilite and iron, without
any definite form, are so seen to be disseminated among the
grains of the interspherular ground-mass of the meteorite.
A closer inspection of the spherules further reveals in many
cases the presence of ('nrrospherular iron. In some spherules the
meteoric silicates may be seen, radiating from a point, but while
the spherule is enclosed in a mixed outer mass of silicates, iron
and troilite in little black specks are seen scattered all through
it, presenting the appearance of having been spurted, as it were,
from a point, the larger particles to the greater distance: and
these specks consist in part of nickeliferous iron, while some are
meteoric pyrites (troilite).
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
In connection with the subject of these spherules, which form
so characteristic a feature of many stony meteorites, it should be
mentioned that occasionally some of the spherules are seen to
be broken in half and the halves separated from each other to
some small distance, a fact of considerable significance, though
not easy of interpretation in connection with the history of the
meteorite and the more or less violent crises it must have passed
through at successive periods in that history.
Evidence of another kind of historical succession in the events
and influences through which a meteorite may have passed is
afforded by the not rare peculiarity of a sort of vein, like a
mineral vein, running through the meteorite. In fact, just as in
a mine one may meet with a fissure that, once dividing the
"country," but subsequently filled by rocky matter, cuts across
the course of a mineral vein which itself was originally formed
in a similar way; and just as such a cross fissure thus inter-
secting with the original metalliferous vein often gives us evidence
of a hetne, i.e. that one side of the new.fissure has slid upwards
or downwards along the other, so an exactly similar thing is met
with in meteorites, and is admirably seen in the microscopic
sections of them.

splendid result of solar physics to establish the nature of the
gaseous molecules of so many elements that have as yet defied
the experimental methods of our terrestrial laboratories. The
banded character of the spectra of 10 many of these metalloids
has lent a really important argument to Mr. Lockyer in his bold
speculation as to their compound nature, in consequence of its
parallelism with the case of compound gases, and his hypothesis
has the merit of giving thus an explanation of the apparent
absence of elements that every argument would lead us to look
for, founded on a principle as ingenious as it is bold in its appli-
cation.
The recognition by Mr. Huggins in the spectra of the stars of
the lines belonging to hydrogen, sodium, magnesium, calcium,
and iron, and of carbon compounds in comets and nebulie, tends
strongly to confirm the probability of a general identity in the
chemical nature of the matter which pervades our universe; and
further shows that the results of these investigations present
no obstacle to our drawing any conclusion to which the logic of
facts might otherwise guide us as to meteorolitic matter having
been in its origin foreign to the solar system. Observations by
v. Konkoly of the magnesium, sodium, and possibly also iron

lines in the August meteoric swarm, like those by Alexander
Herschel of the sodium line in those same St. Lawrence meteors,
are of value as extending the coincidence in the elementary con-
stitution of the sun, the stars, and meteorites, to those minuter
formsjof meteoric matter which, b y their dispersion in the atmo-
sphere, have hitherto been unattainable for the purposes of inves-
tigation.
In passing from the merely elementary components of meteor-
ites to the chemical forms—that is to say, to the minerals in
which these elements are grouped in them, we find ourselves in the
presence of aggregates of crystallised minerals that at once remind
us of our terrestrial rocks. At a first aspect they might easily be
taken for rocks formed under conditions not very different from
those of our globe. A closer inspection, however, brings out dis-
tinctive characters in these that evidence a very different set of
conditions as having prevailed in the formation of the meteoric
and the terrestrial rocks. Without going into minute minera-
logical variations, and needlessly multiplying names, we may
tabulate in a very short list the constituent minerals of the different
sorts of meteorites. Several of these minerals are nearly identical
in composition and crystallographic character with corresponding
minerals met with in terrestrial rocks ; others again are unknown,
while some of them could hardly exist permanently as terrestrial
minerals; and two present the composition of minerals familiar
to us in our own rocks, but crystallographically distinct from these

THE INAUGURATION OF THE YORKSHIRE
COLLEGE OF SCIENCE
E formal opening of the College of Science at
Leeds by the Duke of Devonshire, which we briefly
announced last week, is an event of no mean importance
to the county, and of no small interest to the rest of the
community, inasmuch as we must regard it as another
indication of the great educational movement which has
already been experienced by Manchester, Newcastle,
Birmingham, and Bristol, and is beginning to be felt
more or less strongly in every industrial centre through-
out the country. This movement, as Mr. Former tells us,
is not merely to give education to the captains of in-
dustry; it is to increase the culture of every individual
working man and working woman in the l.ind, and to
give them not elementary education alone, but skilled
knowledge to enable them to earn their living as effi-
ciently as possible by affording them the key to the stores
of knowledge.
It really appears that at last, in this county utterly de-
void of any organisation for anything but the lowest

education, there arc persons who aie gradually realising
the fact, the statement of <vhich has been dinned into
our ears by the best informed minds for more than a
quarter of a century, that the industrial supremacy of
this country depends on other factors than natural
resources, mental vigour, industry, and perseverance.
The illustrious Liebig more than a generation ago,
and in the very town which witnessed the ceremony of
last week, warned us how impossible it was for England
permanently to preserve this supremacy unless she be-
stowed more attention on the sciences which formed the
basis of her chief industries. Nothing could be happier
than the coincidence that Dr. Hayfair, who then inter-
preted this memorable saying of the great German philo-
sopher, should be present to see the Yorkshire people
establishing an educational organisation, which is in no
small degree the outcome of the counsel given to them so
long ago. Truly the bread cast upon the waters has
returned to Leeds after many days. And now let the
promoters of the Yorkshire College take heed to ths
words of counsel given by the many eminent men whom
they invited to take part in the opening ceremony. If
the county is as earnest in furthering its welfare as we
believe it to be, the institution ought not to remain long
on its present limited basis : we hope and trust that the

opinion of its President, Lord Frederick Cavendish, that
to restrict the College to natural science would make it
"a one-legged, one-sided concern," is shared by the rest
of the Council. We do not want a Yorkshire College of
Science, but a Yorkshire College in which science will be
found in its proper place. It must be remembered that the
whole duty of these local colleges is not limited to the in-
struction in the particular sciences which more directly
relate to the manufacturing industries of the districts in
which they are placed ; they must be made to act as nuclei
for higher culture by the establishment of chairs of Art and
Literature. As Dr. Playfair told the people of Leeds,
"a College of Science, such as we are inaugurating to-day,

I am sure they will aid in the co-ordination of your other
educational resources." We are aware that the estab-

will, certainly be effective with those who take a real
interest in Iceland, and who are willing to take
the trouble to master the contents of his two volumes.
The Introduction, covering 260 pages, consists of a con-
densed mass of facts compiled from many sources, relat-
ing to Iceland in all its aspects, and he who studies them
thoroughly will be we'll rewarded for his pains ; besides
the mere pleasure of adding to his knowledge, he will
possess an excellent vantage-ground from which to watch
the progress of the island and any future attempts that
may be made to increase our knowledge of it. Iceland is
gradually becoming a popular tourist-ground, and when
good hotels are built and the means of travel are im-
proved and organised, no doubt it will be included in the
programme of the omnipresent Cook. Intending travellers,

as well as all who desire to see the most trustworthy in-
formation about Iceland put in an accessible form, ought
to feel grateful to Capt. Burton. He has indeed acted in
a very unselfish manner in thus compiling what is really
a valuable monograph on Iceland, instead of concentrating
the attention of the public exclusively on himself and his
own experiences in the country. So great an explorer as
Capt. Burton has long ago proved himself to be would
have been perfectly justified in so doing, and therefore the
voluntary service he has rendered to Iceland and the
British public is all the more enhanced.
There has been a great deal more written about Iceland
than most people are aware of; in his Introduction, Mr.
Burton gives a list of no less than fifty works, mostly
English narratives of travel, which have been written
during the present century, not to mention all that has
been written in previous centuries. The author has not,
however, confined himself in collecting his facts and
theories to what has been published, but has drawn largely
on the liberality of willing friends who have made special
studies of various points connected with the country, its
history, and its people. The result is, we believe, a
handier and more complete account of Iceland than will
be found in any other single work.
The first section of the Introduction treats " Of Thule,"
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and consists of a formidably learned discussion as to the
applications which the classical term has had in various
writers and at various times, from Pytheas of Mar-
seilles downwards. Of course the important point in such
a discussion is to ascertain what Pytheas meant by the
term ; and although it seems to us that the few details
concerning " Thule" which have been preserved apply
more appropriately to Iceland than to any other country
which has been proposed, we are inclined to doubt with
St. Martin (" Histoire de Ge"ographe," p. 104) whether
Pytheas ever saw the country, and to think it more
probable that he got his accounts from the inhabitants of
North Britain. This, however, is not the place to discuss
such a question, even had we space. Capt. Burton,
who seems to take delight in advocating improbable
theories, makes much more than we think the evidence
justifies of the few ecclesiastical remains which the
first Norsemen found on the island, and of the tradi-
tions concerning the Irish ecclesiastics who at one time
found their way to the coasts. These latter no doubt
found their way to Iceland at first by accident; after-

off the south-west corner, one arm proceeding northward
and the other along the south coast, both reuniting in the
North Atlantic between Iceland and Norway. We have
certainly much yet to learn about the causes which con-
tribute to form the climate of a country, but without the
action of some such influence as would be derived from
the Gulf Stream, it seems to us difficult to account for
the comparatively mild climate of Iceland as contrasted
with the decidedly Arctic climate of countries in the same
latitude. But this is a dangerous question to enter upon;
what is wanted at present is not so much discussion as
facts.
Capt. Burton tells us in his preface that he "went to
Iceland feeling by instinct that many travellers had pro-
digiously exaggerated their descriptions, possibly because
they had seldom left home." Stay-at-home people will
therefore be grateful that so experienced a traveller and
so trained an observer as Capt. Burton has gone over the
old ground and told them in a plain, matter-of-fact, yet
exceedingly graphic way, what is actually to be seen. In
his account of his tour the usual" stupendous" writing

will not be found, and many indeed may be inclined to
think that the narrative has too much of the "nil
admirari" spirit about it. This is not our opinion : Capt.
Burton shows frequently throughout the work that he is
quite prepared to admire all that is admirable in the
country and its people, and concerning the latter espe-
cially, it was quite time that we should have a sober and
trustworthy account. Travellers hitherto have been too
much inclined to look upon the Icelander under quite
an auroral glow, as a descendant of the " Hardy Norse-
man " with his traditional tawny beard, fair hair, brawny
build, splendid fighting qualities, with an infusion of rude
gentleness. The Icelander is no doubt a descendant of
the dauntless men who contributed their share in the
building up of the English people, but there seems little
reason to doubt that he is a degenerate one. If we can
believe Capt. Burton, as well as the reports of some other
recent travellers, the chief virtue of the Icelander is lazi-
ness, which keeps him as well from doing harm as positive
good. Even that gentleness of manner and primitive sim-
plicity of social intercourse which early travellers tell us
characterised the people, seem to be rapidly leaving them.
But this is inevitable, and from a practical and humane
point of view not to be regretted ; it is the first stage in the
breaking up of their long lethargy, and to doing away

with a condition of society which is really an anachronism.
There does not seem to be native energy sufficient to the
development of the resources of the country, and it is
well that foreign attention and foreign capital should
be drawn to it, [especially with an eye to the no doubt
extensive sulphur resources; we believe such intercourse
would benefit the Icelanders by bringing them, with all
their dormant good qualities, into the active life of. the
present.
It is unnecessary to follow Capt. Burton in what was to
a great extent a tour, though an unusually critical one,
over previously trodden ground, rather than a journey of
exploiation. He begins at the end with pretty full notes
of a visit to Orkney and Shetland, which he paid on his
return from Iceland. Concerning the prehistoric and
other antiquities of these islands he has of course some-
thing to say, and we commend his criticisms to the anti-
quarian. In Iceland he stayed some time at Reykjavik
before setting out to explore the island, and concerning
the capital, its institutions and people, as well as what is
to be seen in the neighbourhood, he has much to say,

a volcano, Hekla may be a wonder, but as compared with
other volcanoes it is a mere smoking cinder-heap. What-
ever may be the value of Capt. Burton's conclusions, his
minute comparative study of this notable feature of Ice-
landic scenery deserves attention. The Geysirs also he
inspected with considerable minuteness, and concludes
that in their present condition they are " like Hekla, gross
humbugs; and if their decline continues so rapidly, in a
few years there will be nothing save a vulgar solfatara,
440 by 150 yards in extent." In this connection a pretty
full account is given of the various attempts which have
been made to account for the action of Geysirs. The
whole of this portion of the narrative we deem of special
value.
Capt. Burton's final trip was to eastern Iceland. He
sailed from Reykjavik to BerufjorS on the east coast.
Thence [he proceeded with a small cavalcade on
ponies north-west by devious ways to the My-vatn, the
lake in the neighbourhood of which sulphur is so plentiful.
The lake itself and the neighbouring district he describes
in considerable detail, and notes carefully the prominent

features to be met with in the route from BerufjorS. On
his return he attempted to climb the steep pyramidal
mountain] of HeifiubreiS (5,447 feet), a few miles south
of My-vatn, but after a strenuous effort failed to reach the
summit. He also paid a visit to Snrefelland the northern
boundary of the great glacier Vatnajokull, which for the
first time has been recently crossed by the indomitable
Mr. Watts. Capt. Burton speaks of the glacier with con-
siderable enthusiasm, and gives a minute and striking
picture of all he was able to observe ; and now that Mr.
Watts has shown the way, we may hope ere long to have
its main features observed and described in detail.
While in this region the traveller was in the vicinity of
the mysterious 'central desert of Iceland, the Odao'a
Hraun, which the ignorant natives still people with fierce
robbers.
Capt. Burton thus nearly accomplished the circuit of
the island, and it is impossible in the space at our dis-
posal to give any adequate idea of even his personal
narrative. His lively pictures, sketched with the hand of
a master, of Icelandic character and of social life among
all classes, are specially attractive. Nothing worthy of
note escapes his observation, and both the scientific and
the "general"reader will find the work to abound in interest
and ins truction. As a corrective to the usual indiscrimi-

nating narrative of Icelandic travel, it is invaluable. As
we said at the beginning, the work as a whole will give
a better idea of the country from all points of view than
any other single work hitherto published.
One of the most marked features in Capt. Burton's
style is its digressiveness and excessive allusiveness; in
the present work he carries it often to a perplexing extent,
and unless the reader be as well-informed as the traveller
himself, he is apt to get bewildered. This feature en-
forces the most careful reading, and we therefore, perhaps,
ought not to consider it a fault.
The lithographic and other.illustrations'which adorn
the work are creditably done and add to its value. The
general map is very good and useful, but would have
been more so had it been on a larger scale. The special
map of the My-vatn and Vatnajokull district is excellent.
The publisher deserves the word of praise which the
author awards him in the preface.

absolutely new, are worth recording, and should be well
known to forest officers. Thus we are told (page 278) the
proportion of water contained in wood varies according
to the season. Schubler and Neuffler found in the fir
(Abies) 53 per cent, in January and 61 in April; in the
ash (Fraxinus), 29 per cent, in January and 39 in April.
These facts prove that trees contain more water at the
time of the ascent of the sap than in winter. Besides,
it has been found that small branches contain more free
water than large ones, and that these last contain more
than the trunk, which results agree with the knowledge
we possess of the porous nature of the different parts.
The presence of the bark retards desiccation consider-
ably.
Uhr having had some trees felled in June, after the
ascent of the sap, and then having had them placed in
the shade, found that those from which the bark had been
removed had lost 34'53 per cent, of water in July, 3877 in
August, 39'34 in September, 32-62 in October; whilst
those with the bark untouched had only lost during the
same periods C41, o"84, o-92,o-98. Thus it will be seen

rapidly. It is only stripped trunks of small size and soft
wood that dry up with the rapidity above mentioned.
The numerous woodcuts dispersed throughout the book,

consideration of felling and cutting up timber, and of
machinery used in its manipulation. J. R. J.

These two reprints from the "Abhandlungen der k.

author of the first treatise states that the orthogonal pro-
jection of broken lines on given axes, whether in a plane
or in space, has been discussed in scientific works on
theoretical and practical mathematics, but the oblique
projection has not obtained so great prominence. The
subject is gone into very thoroughly by Dr. Matzka, as
may be inferred from the fact of its discussion occupying
70 quarto pages.

limited, and to the country practitioner whose ability to
supply himself with instruments often falls far short of
his desires, the offer of a serviceable microscope for a

instrument in question is endorsed by a long list of
clergymen, lawyers, and even editors, this temptation
becomes irresistible." To show what these worthless

Dehiscence of the Capsules of Collomia
In Mr. Duthie's very interesting account (vol. xii. p. 494) of the
mode of dehiscence of the capsules of this plant, he suggests that
the purpose of the projection of the seeds on to the viscid hairs of
the plant itself may possibly be found in its enabling the plant to
live on its own seeds. Surely this is a superfluous and needlessly
improbable hypothesis. The violent discharge cf the seeds is

undoubtedly one of the modes adopted by nature for their dis-
persion to plots of ground where the mineral constituents of the
soil which they mainly require have not been entirely used up by
the parent plant. Their interception by the parent plant is no
doubt accidental. The purpose served by the viscid hairs of
this and other plants still remains to be discovered if we follow
the clue afforded by Mr. Darwin's observa'ions on invctivorous
plants. The violent expulsion of the seeds from the ripe cap.ule
is a much more common phenomenon than that which we have
exhibited in Collomia, together wilh a few other plants, as
Acanthus, Ruillia, Eschscholtzia, and Geranium, where the whole
fruit is thrown off together. Mr. Duthie will find a good
description of the phenomenon in Hildebrand's "Die Schleu-
derfriichte und ihr im anatomischen Bau begriindeten Mecbanis-
mus," in Pringsheim's "Jahrburh" for 1873-74. The author
draws an interesting comparison between the structure of
Collomia, with its single seed in each division, and its apparatus
for projecting these to a distance, and that of the allied genus
Cilia, with its numerous seeds in each division, which possess no
such mechanism, but which, being much lighter, are conse-
quently more easily dispersed by the wind.

Tails of Rats and Mice
It is, I believe, pretty generally supposed that rats and mice
use their tails for feeding purposes in cases where the food to be
eaten is contained in vessels too narrow to admit the entire body
of the animal. I am not aware, however, that the truth of this
supposition has ever been actually tested by any trustworthy
person, and so think that the following simple experiments are
worth publishing
Having obtained a couple of tall-shaped preserve bottles with
rather short and narrow neclts, I filled them to within three
inches of the top with red currant jelly which had only half
stiffened. I covered the bottles with bladder in the ordinary
way, and then stood them in a place frequented by rats. Next
morning the bladder covering each of the bottles had a small
hole gnawed through it, and the level of the jelly was reduced in
both bottles to the same extent. Now, as this ex'ent corre-
sponded to about the length of a rat's tail if inserted at the hole
in the bladder, and as this hole was not much more than just
large enough to admit the root of this organ, I do not see that
any further evidence is required to prove the manner in which
the rats obtained the ielly, viz., by repeatedly introducing their

tails into the viscid matter, and as repeatedly licking them
clean.
However, to put the question quite beyond doubt, I refilled
the bottles to the extent of half an inch above the jelly level left
by the rats, and having placed a circle of moist paper upon each
of the jelly surfaces, covered the bottles with blidder as before.
I now ieft the bottles in a place where there were no rats or
mice, until a good crop of mould had grown upon one of the
moistened piece; of paper. The bottle containing this crop of
mould I then transferred to the place where the rats were
numerous. Next morning the bladder had again been ea'.en
through at one edge, and upon the mould there were numerous
and distinct tracings of the rats' tads, resembling mirks made
with the top of a penholder. These tracings were evidently
caused by the animals sweeping their tails about in the fruitless
endeavour to find a hole in the circle of paper which covered the
jelly. George J. Romanes

NEPTUNIAN SYSTEMS.
\\THEN the 26-inch equatorial, with an object-glass
* * "nearly perfect in figure," was mounted at the
United States Naval Observatory, Washington, it was
resolved that its great powers should be first devoted to
systematic observations of the satellites of the exterior

planets, with the view not only to the better determination
of the elements of their orbits, but, more especially, of
the masses of their primaries ; previous attempts in this
direction, from the great difficulties attending observa-
tions, having led to very discordant values. Accordingly
all the minor arrangements of the instrument were com-
pleted with this particular object in view, and no other
regular work of dissimilar character was attempted while
the satellite-observations were in progress.
In the memoir (Washington Observations, 1873, Ap-
pendix I.) to which allusion was made in this column last
week, Professor Newcomb describes generally his method
of observation; and with respect to his measures of the
inner satellites of Uranus, which he thinks may fairly be
regarded as the most difficult well-known objects in the
heavens, he expresses surprise at the degree of precision
with which he was able to bisect them with the faintly-
illuminated wire of the micrometer, an examination of
the individual measures having shown that they were not
more discordant than those of the outer satellites.
In discussing the observations of the satellites of Ura-

and circular elements are accordingly used in the forma-
tion ot tables for the prediction of the positions of the
satellite. For the epoch 1873, December 31, Washington
mean noon, the mean longitude of the satellite, reckoned
from the intersection of the orbit with the plane parallel
to the earth's equator, and passing through the centre of
the planet, was 98°g6 ; the node on equator, i83°-03, and
the inclination, i2i°7. The radius of the orbit at the
mean distance of Neptune [1-47814] is found to be
l6"'275, or 218,550 miles. The mean motion assumed at
the commencement of the discussion was that founded
upon the observations of Mr. Lassell (Hind, "Monthly
Notices," vol. xv.), and does not appear to admit of any
sensible correction. Prof. Newcomb thinks the motion of
mean longitude is correct within 2° or 30 a century. The
period of revolution of the satellite is 58769 days.
No trace of a second satellite of Neptune has ever been
seen, though it has been looked for carefully on several
occasions. •
The conclusion to which Prof. Newcomb's investiga-
tions have led, "that the orbits of all the satellites of the

two outer planets are less excentric than those of the
planets of our system, and that, so far as observations
have yet shown, they may be perfect circles," will appear
a remarkable one.
We take this opportunity of presenting the elements of
the orbits of Uranus and Neptune adopted in the Tables
of Prof. Newcomb, as perhaps an acceptable addition to
the preceding outline of his researches on the satellites of
these planets. The values of the major axes here given
are not those which would result from the mean motion
with correction for the mass, but in the case of Uranus
include a constant term in the perturbations of the radius
vector, and in that of Neptune, constants introduced by
the action of the planets, and effect of secular variation of

Mooruk, but afterwards admitted their distinctness. My
belief is that they arc probably the same as the next
species (C. westtrtnannt), although the colours of the

agree.
7. WESTERMAN'S CASSOWARY (C. westermanni).—This
species I established on a bird still living in the Zoological
Gardens, which we received from Mr. Westerman in 1871.
At first I referred this bird to C. kaupi, of Rosenberg,
until that naturalist showed that the pretended species
which lie had so named was nothing more than the young
of C. uniappendiculatus. I then changed our bird's name
to C. li'fstennanni. I have recently seen two other living
specimens of this bird in the Zoological Gardens at

not able to procure specimens.

9. THE MOORUK, OR BENNETT'S CASSOWARY (C. ben-
iietti).—In 1857 Mr. Gould described this Cassowary from
a drawing sent to him by Dr. George Bennett, of Sydney,
;ind soon afterwards a living pair were sent to us by our
excellent friend, after whom the species had been named.
These birds bred in the Gardens in 1864, but we have
now unfortunately lost them. Bennett's Cassowary is an
inhabitant of New Britain, to the east of New Guinea,
and is easily distinguishable from its congeners by its blue
throat and back of the neck.
Omitting for the moment the doubtful C. papuanus, it
will be thus seen that we have tolerably certain indica-
tions of the districts in which the other eight Cassowaries
are found. It would be very desirable, however, to get
further information concerning them, and also to ascer-
tain what is the Cassowary of Jobie, and whether the
other islands adjacent to New Britain possess, as is
probable, indigenous species of this group.

ANOTHER MONSTER REFRACTOR
'T'HE experiment rendered possible, now some ten
•*• years ago, by Mr. Ncwall, and made with such
triumphant* success by Mr. Cooke, is again bearing fruit.
Another monster telescope, indeed the largest yet at-
tempted, is now in course of construction at Mr. Grubb's
new works, near Dublin. This instrument has been
ordered by the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian
Government for the new Observatory now in course of
erection at Vienna. The object-glass will have an aper-
ture of over 26 inches, probably about 27 inches, according
as the discs of glass, which are being manufactured in the
rough, by M. Feil, of Paris, may turn out on finishing.
The focal length is to be about 32 feet. The general form
of mounting will be modified to suit the special require-
ments of such a monster instrument. The great base
casting (weighing some seven to eight tons) will form a
chamber (about 12 feet long, 4 feet 6 inches wide, and 8
feet high) for the clock, which will be massive in propor-
tion to the other parts. The axes will all have their fric-
tion relieved by anti-friction apparatus. The tube will be

understood that the solar rays entering through the perforations
at the upper end of the tube, converge at the lower end and
piss through the small perforations, causing maximum indication
of the f ical actinometers as stated. Now, suppose that a cir-

of the sun, viz. 145-2 millimetres diameter, be inserted concen-

that the three focal actinometers employed will be acted upon

the solar disc, (2) from a antral region containing \ of the area,
and (3) from a zone at the border containing also \ of the area of
the solar disc. It is scarcely necessary to point out that an
accurate comparison of the intensity of the radiant heat emanating
from the central part and from the sun's border calls for simul-
tanious observation, in order to avoid the errors resulting from
change of zenith distance and variation of atmospheric absorption
during the investigation. The great advantage of obtaining also
a simultaneous indication of the intensity transmitted by radiation

from the entire solar disc is self-evident, since this indication
serves as an effectual check on the observed intensities emanating
from the centre and from the border. The latter obviously must
be less, while the former must be greater, for a given area, than
the indication of the focal actinometer which receives the radia-
tion of the entire solar disc
The foregoing demonstration, based on hypothesis, having
established the possibility of ascertaining by direct observation
the temperature produced by the rays projected from certain
parts of the solar surface, let us now examine the means actu-
ally employed. An observer on the 40thdeg. latitude, stationed
on the north side of a building 28 metres high pointing east and
west, can just see the sun pass the meridian, during the summer

solstice, if he occupies a position about 8 metres from such
building. Now, if an opaque screen perforated by a circular
opening 313 millimetres in diameter be placed on the top of the
supposed building, the entire solar disc may be seen through the
same, provided it faces the sun at right angles. But if the per-
foration in the said screen be 140 millimetres in diameter, only \
of the area of the solat disc will be seen. And if the screen be
removed and a circular plate 280 millimetres in diameter put in
its place, the observer, ranging himself in line with the plate
and the sun's centre, can only see a narrow border I' 42'' of the
solar disc. Obviously the screen placed on the top of the build-
ing might be perforated like the upper diaphragm of the sup-
posed telescopic tube, and a plate resembling the lower dia-
phragm, secured by appropriate means near the ground, might be
made to support the focal actinometers in such a manner that
their axes pass through the centres of the perforations of the
screen above the building. It is hardly necessary to state that
the plate supporting the actinometers should be attached to
some mechanism capable of imparting to it a parallactic move-

menr, during the observation, corresponding with the sun's decli-
nation and the earth's diurnal motion; and, that some adequate
mechanism should be employed for regulating the position of
the perforated screen and adjusting the focal distance in accor-
dance with the change of the subtended angle consequent on the
varying distance from the sun. It will be evident that since the
first-named mechanism rests on the ground, while the latter is
secured to a massive building, far greater steadiness will be
attained by our simple and comparatively inexpensive device,
than by employing a telescopic tube of the most perfect con-
struction mounted equatorialljr.
With reference to the influence of diffraction, it should be
stated that before determining the size of the screens intended to
shut out certain parts of the solar disc during the investigation,
the amount of inflection of the sun's rays was carefully ascer-
tained. Two distinct methods were adopted : (i) measuring the
additional amount of heat transmitted to the focal thermometers
in consequence of the inflection of the rays; (2) increasing the
theoretical size of the screens until the effect of inflection was
overcome and the luminous rays completely excluded. Regarding
the first-named method of ascertaining the diffraction, it is im-
portant to mention that the temperature transmitted to the focal

actinometers by the inflected radiation which passes outside of
the theoretically determined screens is not proportionate to the
inflection ascertained by the process of enlargement referred to.
This circumstance at first rendered the investigation somewhat
complicated, but it soon becamj evident thit the discrepancy is
caused by the comparatively smill inflection of the invisible heat
rays. It will be seen presently that the radiant heat which
passes outside of the scresns in consequence of diffraction is
considerably less than that which would be transmitted to the
focal actinometers if the calorific rays were subjected to an
amount of inflection corresponding with the enlargement of the
screens beyond the theoretical dimension? necessary to exclude
the luminous rays.
Let us first consider the method of ascertaining the inflection
of the rays by measuring the additional amount of heat trans-
mitted to the focal actinometers. Fig. I, see illustration, repre-
sents the solar disc, a being the focal actinometer exposed to the
converged rays, a' a' representing an imaginary plane situated
177 metres from a, at which distance the section of the pencil of
converging rays will be 162-4. millimetres in diameter, provided
the earth is near aphelion. Fig. 2 also represents the solar disc,
and c the actinometer exposed to the converged rays ; but a per-
forated screen *' b' is interposed, the perforation being of such a
size that only the rays projected by the central half of the solar

from c when the earth is in the position before referred to, the
said perforation must be 114'83 millimetres In diameter, in orJer
that the lines b x c miy be straight Fig. 3 likewise represents
the solar disc, its area being divided in two concentric hilve; by
the circle dii; but in place of a perforated screen, an opaque cir-
cular screen d' is introduced at the same distance from the focal
actinometer as in Fig. 2; consequently the lines dy'f will be
straight Now, if the actinometers a, c, and /be exposed to the
converged solar radiation simultantoiisly and during an equal
interval of time, c and/receiving the heat from one half of the
solar disc (the former from the central and the latter from the

should correspond exactly with the temperature transmitted from
the entire solar disc to a. Observation, however, shows that
the temperatures of e and / together is 0-091 greater than the
temperature imparted to a. Hence an increase of temperature

NATURE.
That the silicates contained in meteorites should be identical,
or nearly so, with corresponding minerals in our globe seems
only the natural consequence of the identity in the elements
that constitute both. They are essentially magnesium silicates—
namely, olivine the basic, and enstatite (or bronzite) the neutral
silicate, the latter taking the form of augite to an amount corre-
sponding to the calcium present, where this latter element is a
constituent of the meteorite. Where, at the first production of
the meteoric minerals by the union of their elements, the oxygen
was in sufficient amount to allow of a portion of the iron pre-
sent being in the state of an oxide, ferrous oxide is combined in
the silicate, and the meteoric olivines are from this cause gene-
rally ferriferous, and the enstatite also assumt s one of the varie-
ties of that mineral which the mineralogist has termed bronzite.
The silicic acid is rarely in excess of the amount requisite to
form an enstatite or augite; usually the contrary condition is
evidenced by the presence of some olivine. The case of the
occurrence of free silica in the Breitenbach meteorite, at present
exceptional, may, however, hereafter prove to be characteristic
of a type, and its occurrence, not as quartz, nor even as tridy-
mite (the crystallised silica discovered by von Rath), but in the

form to which I gave the name asmanite, in crystals belonging to
the orthorhombic system with the specific gravity of fused quartz,
seems to point to conditions, probably involving an enormous
temperature, as those under which such meteorites have been
formed, and such as have not been realised in the production of
any of the acid or super-siliceous silicates of our globe. The
felspathic ingredients of meteorites are for the most part basic,
chiefly consisting of anorthite, the most basic of terrestrial
felspars, known as a crystallised mineral in volcanic rocks.
Crystals of meteoric anorthite were measured by Viktor von Lang
at the British Museum, with results quite concoidant with those
yielded by the crystals from the volcanoes of our planet. A
felspar with a composition corresponding to that of labradorite,
on the other hand, in the only meteorite in which its presence
has been established beyond doubt, is proved by Tschermak to
crystallise in the cubic system, instead of the anorthic system to
which terrestrial labradorite belongs.
Attempts have been made to classify meteorites according to
their mineralogical constitution. As a provisional method,
such a classification has its uses ; but while we find that the same
meteorite may contain distinct portions which severally would
authorise its being placed in different classes, such a classification
must necessarily be very imperfect.
The best general divisions are those of Gustav Rose; and in
the following table are classed the various groups of Aerolites,

the other hand the silicates composing meteorites, and those
constituting the mass of our terrestrial rocks, are alike almost
devoid of nickel; and a process that would reduce the iron in
such rocks (e.g. serpentine or Iherzolite) as contain traces of this
element would simultaneously reduce the nickel also to the
metallic condition, as has been shown by Daubree.
Among those who have sought to throw light on the part of
our problem which deals with the chemical history of meteorites,
M. Daubree, the distinguished Director of the F.cole des Mines,
stands forward. 1 le has subjected both meteorites and certain
terrestrial rocks in some respects mineralogically allied to them to
fusion under special conditions. lie has, further, reviewed in a
valuable article in the Comptes Ruidus of the French Academy,
the two opposite chemical conditions under which aerolittc matter
may be supposed to have assumed its present form; those namely,
first, of the oxidation with a limited supply of oxygen of the
elements composing a meteorite assumed as combined inter st;
and secondly, a condition under which a basic ferruginous silicate
may be supposed to be converted into a^neutral silicate with the
emancipation of free iron by the operation of reducing agents,
such as hydrogen or carbon, acting on the ferrous silicate at a

high temperature.
In this way an olivine, rich in diferrous silicate, would become
a bronzite poor in ferrous silicate, or become an enslatite without
any iron in it at all, the iron lost in either case by the olivine
being separated as metallic iron; and M. Daubree performed
transformations of this kind.
Now, the remarkable discovery by the late Frof. Graham of
hydrogen in the Lenarto iron, and that recently made by Wohler
of carbonic oxide in the iron of Ovifak (due, however, probably
in this case to the action of magnetic iron-oxide on the carbon
of the meteorite), and also by Prof. Mallet of the same gas in a
meteoric iron from Virginia, lend some probability to the view of
M. Daubree.
Still the existence of great masses of siderolites like those of
Pallas and from Atacama, rich in ferruginous olivine, and pre-
senting, so far as the analyses may be trusted, no trace of ensta-
tite, or even bronzite, offers a great obstacle to the view that the
iron in these cases was the result of a reduction from olivine.
So again the Breitenbach siderolite, notwithstanding its large
ingredient of free silica (as asmanite) consists largely of a bronzite
very rich in ferrous monosilicate. This bronzite, however, it is
to be said, resists the reducing action of hydrogen at a considerable
temperature.
The similarity, not to say the peculiarity, as well in their chemical
nature as in their mechanical condition that 1 have alluded to as

characterising so many meteorites would seem to impose some
restrictions on our freedom in tracing the origin of these bodies to
distant and dissevered regions of interstellar space. And, indeed,
though a great unity and simplicity in condition and in material
would seem to rule throughout the stellar universe, as viewed by our
present means of knowledge, and so far would justify our treating
iightly the sameness of the meteoric material that reaches us as a
chedc on our reasonings; yet it is to be borne in mind that the
prism has only begun to interpret for us the language of the stars,
and that further research may introduce complexity, and narrow
the limits of our problem. On the other hand, we can only
reason legitimately from the standing-point of the present; and
it is equally.' probable, r.ay, almost certain, that the stellar
spectra, in which, for instance, the lines characterising nickel
have not yet been found, will, on direct search for them, yield
those lines, and then the arguments otherwise converging on the
probability of meteorites coming to us from interstellar space will
acquire an almost conclusive character; for the difficulties in the
way of our confining their origin to our own solar system are
almost insuperable. Their high proper velocity, often far greater

to recognise for all of these bodies—whether on encountering the
earth they had become actually members of the solar family or
not—an ultimately extra-solar origin; that, in fact, whether
they, some or all of them, had become temporarily or perma-
nently imprisoned, as it were, in the vortex of solar attraction,
the probability is that they originally entered our system from the
interstellar spaces beyond it. And it may further be said, that
the tendency of scientific conviction is in the direction of recog-
nising the collection towards and concentration in definite cen-
tres of the matter of the universe, as a cosmical law, rather than
the opposite supposition of such centres being the sources whence
matter is dispersed into space.
In the meteorites that fall on our earth (certainly in con-
siderable numbers) we have to acknowledge the evidence of
a vast and perpetual movement in space of matter otherwise
unseen, about which we can orly reason as part of a great
feature in the universe, which we have every ground for not
supposing to be confined within the limits of the solar system.
That this matter, whether intercepted or not by the planets
and the sun, should to an ever-increasing amount become en-
tangled in the web of solar and planetary attraction, and that

the same operation should be collecting round other stars and
in distant systems, such moving clouds of meteoric particles as
have been treated by Schiaparclli, Leverrier, and other astro-
nomers, whether as indiviluals or in clusters widely separated,
of wandering stone or iron, is a necessary deduction from the
view that we have assumed regarding the tendency of cosmical
matter to collect towards centres.
But in order to trace the previous stages of the history of any
meteorite, and in particular to determine the conditions under
which its present constitution as a rock took its origin, we have
only for our guide the actual record written on the meteoric mass
itself; and it is in this direction that the mineralogist is now
working.
But the process is necessarily a gradual one. We may indeed
assert that the meteorites we know have, probably all of them,
been originally formed under conditions from which the presence
of water or of free oxygen to the amount requisite to oxidise
entirely the elements present were excluded; for this is proved
by the nature of the minerals constituting the meteorites, and by
the way in which the metallic iron is distributed through them.
The progress of solar physics and the reflex light it is likely to
shed on the condition of the primeval chaos of nebular matter,
and the stages by which suns and planets were evolved, will no
doubt help to explain the origin of meteorites; and possibly they
in turn will be found to offer some not unimportant evidence on

I now come to the desijn I have in hand. Mr. Chadwick has
many times told us that he could build a city that would give
any stated mortality, from fifty, or any number more, to five, or
perhaps some number less, in the thousand annually. I believe
Mr. Chadwick to be correct to the letter in this statement, and
for that reason I have projected a city that shall show the lowest
mortality.
I need not sty no such city exists, and you must pardon me
for drawing upon your imaginations as I describe it. Depicting
nothing whatever but what is at this present moment easily

possible, I shall strive to bring into ready and agreeable view a
community not abundantly favoured by natural resources, which,
under the direction of the scientific knowledge acquired in the
past two generations, has attained a vitality not perfectly natural,
but approaching to that standard. In an artistic sense ic would
have been better to have chosen a smill town or large village
than a city for my description; but as the great mortality of
states is resident in cities, it is practically better to take the
larger and less favoured community. If cilies could be trans-
formed, the rest would follow.
Our city, which may be named Hygeia, has the advantage of
being a new foundation, but it is so built that existing cities
might be largely modelled upon it.
The population of the city may be placed at 100,000, living
in 20,000 houses, built on 4,000 acres of land—an average of
twenty-five persons to an acre. This may be considered a large
population for the space occupied, but, since the effect of density
on vitality tells only determinately when it reaches a certain
extreme degree, as in Liverpool and Glasgow, the estimate may
be ventured.
The safety of the population of the city is provided for against

ministers to taste, that, in the houses of the wealthy, delightful
patterns of work of Pompeian elegance are soon introduced.
As with the bricks, so with the mortar and the wood em-
ployed in building ; they are rendered, as far as possible, free
of moisture. Sea-sand containing salt, and wood that has been
saturated with sea-water, two common commodities in badly-
built houses, find no place in our modem city.
The most radical changes in the houses of our city are in the
chimneys, the roofs, the kitchens, and their adjoining offices.
The chimneys, arranged after the manner proposed by Mr.
Spencer Wells, are all connected with central shafts, into which
the smoke is drawn, and, after being passed through a gas
furnace to destroy the free carbon, is discharged colourless into
the open air. The city, therefore, at the expense of a small
smoke rate, is free of raised chimneys and of the intolerable
nuisance of smoke. The roofs of the houses are but slightly
arched, and are indeed all but flat. They are covered either with
asphalte, which experience, out of our supposed city, has proved
to last long and to be easily repaired, or with flat tile. The roofs,
barricaded round with iron palisade, tastefully painted, mrke
excellent outdoor grounds for every house. In some instances

flowers are cultivated on them.
The housewife must not be shocked when she hears that the
kitchens of our model city, and all the kitchen offices, are imme-
diately beneath these garden roofs ; are, in fact, in the upper floor
ot the house instead of the lower. In every point of view, sani-
tary and economical, this arrangement succeeds admirably. The
kitchen is lighted to perfection, so that all uncleanliness is at
once detected. The smell which arises from cooking is never
disseminated through the rooms of the house. In conveying the
cooked food from the kitchen, in houses where there is no lift,
the heavy-weighted dishes have to be conveyed down, the emptied
and lighter dishes upstairs. The hot water from the kitchen
boiler is distributed easily by conducting pipes into the lower
rooms, so that in every room and bedroom hot and cold water
can at all times be obtained for washing or cleaning purposes;
and as on every floor thcie is a sink for receiving waste water, the
carrying of heavy pails from floor to floor is not required. The
scullery, which is by the side of the kitchen, is provided with a
copper and all the appliances for laundry work ; and when that is
done at home, the open places on the roof above make an
excellent drying ground.
In the wall of the scullery is the upper opening to the shaft
of the dust-bin. This shaft, open to the air from thej roof,
extends to the bin under the basement of the house. A sliding
door in the wall opens into the shaft to receive the dust, and this

plan is carried out on every floor. The coal-bin is off the
scullery, and is ventilated into the air through a shaft, also
passing through the roof.
On the landing in the second or middle stories of the three-
storied houses there is a bath-room, supplied with hot and cold
water from the kitchen above. The floor of the kitchen and of
all the upper stories is slightly raised in the centre, and is of
smooth grey tile; the floor of the bath-room is the same. In
the living-rooms, where the floors are of wood, a true oak margin
of floor extends two feet around each room. Over this no carpet
is ever laid. It is kept blight and clean by the old-fashioned
bees'-wax and turpentine, and the air is made fresh and ozonic by
the process.
Considering that a third part of the life of man is, or should
be, spent in sleep, great care is taken with the bedrooms, so
that they shall be thoroughly lighted, roomy, and ventilated.
Twelve hundred cubic feet of space is allowed for each sleeper,
and jfrom the sleeping apartments all unnecessary articles of
furniture and of dress are rigorously excluded. Old clothes, old

prize of 20,000 francs should be presented every two years by the
French Institute, each of the five academies being in turn autho-

the whole body of the Institute. The first laureate was M.
Thiers, proposed by the Academic Francaise for lS6l, on the
ground of the excellency of his historical works. In 1863 the
prize was propcsed by the Academy of Inscriptions, and given
to M. Jules Oppert, for his Assjrian discoveries. In 1865 M.
\Vurtz was propose! by the Academy of Scieaces, for his
di-coveries in chemistry. In 1867 M. Henri Martin was se-
lected by the Academy of Moral Sciences, lor his Histo>y of
France. In 1869 M. Guizot was elected by the Academic Fran-
caise, using its right for the second time. In 1873 the Academy
of Inscriptions selected M. Mariette, for his Egyptian discoveries.
The Academy of Sciences having to exert its prerogative this

the ground of select.on is his "discoveries on the effects of oxy-

Some interesting results were given by Mr. H. M. Taylor,
Fellow and Tutor of Trinily College, Cambridge, in a paper
"On the Relative Values of the Pieces at Chess," read before
the British Associatipn at Bristol. He found by a n.athema-
tical process that if a knigtit and king of different colours were
placed on a chessboard at random, the odds against the king
being in check were II to I ; if a bishop and a king, 31 to 5 ; if a
rook and a king, 7 to 2 ; and if a queen and a king, 23 to 13. If,
however, we consider only safe check (i.e. check in which the
king is unable to take the piece), the odds are respectively 11 to
I, 131 to 13, 5 to I, 107 to 37. From these numbers we can
obtain a fair theoretical [measure of the relative values of the
piece?. Thus, if we lake as our measure the chance of safe check,
the values of the knight, bishop, rook, and queen are in the ratio
12, 13, 24, 37, while the.values of these pieces in the same order
as given by Staunton are 3 05, 3'50, 5'48, and 9'94, the value
of the pawn being taken as unity. Mr. Taylor remarks that the
value of a pawn depends so much on the fact that it is possible
to convert it into a queen, that the method does not appear appli-

The production of silk in South America is rapidly increasing

the cultivation of the silkworm, which feeds on the leaves of the

The Government of Brazil is said to be contemplating offering

The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America.
By Hubeit Howe Bancroft. Vol. ii. Civilised Nations.
Vol. iii. Myths and Languages. (London : Longmans
and Co., 1875.)
THE publication of this great anthropological work
goes on rapidly, and no doubt the two remaining
volumes will be out in a few months. Every reader must
be glad that the author departs more and more from his
original plan of making his book a mere museum of com-
piled infoimation, and now makes some attempt towards
interpreting the mythical and religious puzzles of Mexico
and Central America. The introductory essays on the phi-
losophy of civilisation and religion may not be of startling
originality, but at any rate they are the deliberately
adopted conclusions of a writer with an unusually large
knowledge of the facts. Mr. Bancroft has evidently
come, like so many thinkers of this generation, under the
genial influence of Emerson. To his mind, the world
seems animated by a " Soul of Progress," individual men

working on unknowingly, ar.d often against their will,
towards a mysterious end which is the goal of civilisation.
The two apparently oppugnant agencies of good and evil
lend together toward one end; "Night or day, love or
crime, leads all souls to the good." At one stage of civili-
sation blind faith is essential to give strength to man's
belief, till at another stage scepticism has to come in and
destroy the scaffolding of superstition, leaving the mental
fabric which has been reared by its means. War and
tyranny do the work of consolidating nations and founding
political institutions, till the time comes when, having done
their work in promoting good, they may themselves be
cast out for being evil. Institutions which were at first
the essentials of civilisation become, as man advances, a
drag on his progress, and have to be abolished. The
union of Church and State, of superstition and despotism
a union still necessarily kept up in jome of the more
backward civilisations, was in barbarous ages a real
means of moral and intellectual advance from a wilder
and lower state. Thus we see in every phase of develop-
ment the result of a social evolution, but where it is to
end, whither it is tending, we cannot tell as yet, nor can
we yet fully understand its guiding laws, for "like all
other progressional phenomena, they wait not upon man;
they are self-creative, and force themselves upon the mind

age after age, slowly but surely, as the intellect is able to
receive them."
One really stands in need of some such hopeful theory
of social evolution, in reading the details of Mexican
religion. The chapter on Public Festivals is a sickening
catalogue of horrors. It begins mildly with the priests
scarifying and mutilating themselves, especially by boring
holes in their tongues to pass sticks through. Then
comes the sacrifice of a number of sucking infants, who
were carried in procession on gorgeous litters to be slain
on the mountains and in the lake, some of the bodies
being brought back as a delicacy for the priests and
nobles. Then an account of a festival, where the
human victims, having had their hearts cut out in the

usual way on the sacrificial stone, were then flayed; their
flesh was eaten at a banquet, and the lads of the colleges
dressed up in their skins and went about singing, dancing,
and asking for contributions : "those who refused to give
anything received a stroke in the face from the dangling
arm." A little later comes the feast of the Fire-god,

which modern writers apply the old designation of
Nahua (Nahuatl). But his description of the Aztec civi-
lisation at the time of the Spanish Conquest scarcely
suggests a state of decay. The handicrafts of the stone-
cutter, the weaver, and the goldsmith, the elaborate orga-
nisation of the priesthood and the army, of the colleges
for training boys'and girls, and of the guilds of merchants,
were found by the Europeans in full vigour. The Mexi-
cans not only had a system of picture-writing and kept
their chronicles in it, but King Nezahualcoyotl is said to
have made a law prescribing the penalty of death on
historians who should record fictitious events. This same
king made severe forest-laws to prevent the supply of
wood in the country being exhausted, so that the people
did not dare even to pick up the fallen wood. Such a
state of things may indicate a certain stiffness and arti-
ficiality of law and custom, but hardly a fall from an
earlier higher stale. In any new discussion of the problem
of American civilisation, for which these volumes afford
the first ample collection of materials, we should prefer
reasoning on Aztec life as Cortes saw it, to speculating on

the institutions of the half mythical Toltecs of tradition.
In looking through the present volumes two obser-
vations suggest themselves. Mr. Bancroft has drawn up
descriptions of the languages of the Pacific district which
are of some use in defining the general structure of each,
and justifying the class-arrangement which he adopts.
But he only gives a few specimen words of each lan-
guage, such as pronouns, numerals, incomplete parts of a
verb, and perhaps a Lord's Prayer. We wish, consider-
ing the space he has spared for native myths, that he had
found room for a series of concise grammars. The exist-
ing grammars and dictionaries of many of these lan-
guages, even such as Aztec and Maya, which are the
spoken languages of large populations, are so scarce and
costly as to be out of the reach of ordinary philologists.
For instance, it is difficult to get sufficient information as
to one of the most curious languages of Mexico, the
Otomi, described by several writers as a real mono-
syllabic language imbedded among languages like the
Aztec, whose formation is polysyllabic-agglutinative in the
extreme. This is a most interesting phenomenon in philo-
logy, and we looked to Mr. Bancroft at least to settle the
disputed point whether the Otomi tongue is really mono-
syllabic. There are plenty of polysyllables in it, such as
tayo, dog; nxiiyo, bitch; malicisi, heaven; tiuga, I. But
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the question is whether the statement is fully borne out,
that " in words compounded of more than one syllable,
each syllable preserves its original meaning." In the first
two instances this is evidently true, ta-yo, nxu-yo being
decomposable as "male dog," " female dog." Whether
the other two words can be analysed we do not know.
So interesting is the Otomi tongue for its bearing on the
theory of the monosyllabic origin of language, that it
would be worth while to collect and reprint everything
that is known about it. For one thing thanks arc due to
Mr. Bancroft, that he insists on the merely accidental
character of such resemblances as exist between Otomi
and Chinese. Naxera's baseless theory of a connection
between these two languages had publicity given to it by
Prcscott, and is not yet forgotten.
The collection of cosmogonic traditions in the third
volume is remarkable, and may lead us to expect valuable
results to science when the creation-myths of all tribes and
nations of the world shall be put together and carefully-
analysed. Many of them are of course mere products of
childish fancy. In Central California the story is that in

From what has been said above it is evident that there
are two features in this volume of Prof. Huxley's which
call for special notice on account of their novelty. The
first of these is that Botany and Zoology are taught in
combination, as parts of the science of living organisa-
tions—Biology. The second is that the subject is taught
practically; in other words, with full-information on how
to observe the features described.
Most amateur students of so-called science, or col-
lectors, run in a single groove of thought. They learn
to recognise specific differences in those groups of ani-
mals, fossils, or plants which they honour with their
patronage; they discover minute variations in individual
specimens, and frequently attempt to load nomenclature
with fresh names, which may or may not have to be
swamped in the mass of synonyms—already but too large
—according to their knowledge of the literature of the
subject they affect. In the scale of scientific investigators
these stand lowest. They do good; their work is indis-
pensable; the mental effort required for its production is,
however, small, and is generally associated with a want

scalpels, forceps, and scissors, being nearly all that is
essential to a biological laboratory. These can be pro-
cured by anyone; and the student when thus equipped
with Huxley and Martin's "Practical Biology" in his
hands, need only look around for some of the most
easily obtainable animals, upon getting which he can
start work in good earnest.
In the descriptive portion of the work there is one
point (o which we cannot help referring, which is in con-
nection with the circulation of the blood. It is an expla-
nation, originally given by Briickc, we believe, of the
manner in which the mixed arterial and venous blood in
the single ventricle of the frog is distributed in such a
manner that the venous blood mostly enters the lungs. "It
fills (during the systole) the"conus_arteriosus, and, finding
least resistance in the short and wide pulmonary vessels,
passes along the left side of the median valve into them.
But as they become distended and less resistance is offered
elsewhere, the next portion passes on the light side of the
longitudinal valve into the aortic arches." The words
italicised by us are those which it is difficult to compre-

hend, for it is evident that if the pulmonary artery offers
less resistance at the commencement of the systole, it
will do so all through the revolution in proportion to the
relative calibre of its capillaries and those of the system
generally; and then there is no reason why the valve
should flap back.

The autotype illustrations which form the main feature

the views of the human figure, a good idea of the scale of

the north of the province of Wellington. From this
volcano three lines of volcanic action are supposed to
proceed in a north-easterly direction by Lake Taupo to
Lakes Rotorua, Rotoiti, and Rotomahana respectively, the
last-mentioned lineproceeding inwards as far as the marine
volcano Whakari, in the Bay of Plenty; this line also,

Lake Taupo, about forty miles to the north of Ton-

outflow of the river Waikato from Lake Taupo, is marked
by the hot springs and steam jets of Otumaheke and
Orakcikorako, on the river's banks, and those of the
Pairoa mountain range. The third line of action forming
eruptions of this kind is exhibited in the hot springs of
Kotorua and the solfataras of Rotoiti, which terminate
these specimens of volcanic action on land, being situated
near the sea-coast. While all along these three lines

Ocean Circulation
Having carefully read Mr. Croll's papers in Ihe Philosophical
Magazine for September and October, I find in them the full
confirmation of my statement tbat his "crucial-test" argument
is based on the assumption of an equilibrium between the Equa-
torial and the North Atlantic columns; the words "to be in
equilibrium " or " in order to equilibrium " being used over and
over again to fix this as the essential condition of the compu-
tation by which the North Atlantic column is made out to

be 3\ feet higher than the Equatorial.
No reference to other passages in Mr. Croll's writings can
countervail this fact. I pointed out at Bristol the fallacy it in-
volves, which was at once recognised by Sir William Thomson,
General Strachey, and other competent authorities. This fal-
lacy becomes obvious in the following parallel case :—
The specific gravity of /Kgean water being to that of Black
Sea water as (say) 1029 to 1013, a column of Black Sea
water 1,029 feet high would be required to balance a column of
yEgean water 1,013 fee' high; therefore (on Mr. Croll's assump-
tion of an equilibrium) the level of the Black Sea must be above
that of the /ligean in the proportion of 16 feet to 1,013 feet of
depth. But that there is not an equilibrium between the two
columns, is conclusively proved by the deep inflow of /Egean
water which always accompanies the surface-outflow of Black
Sea water, showing the /Egean column to be the heavier.
Now Mr. CroU has obviously no more right to assume an
equilibrium between the North Atlantic and the Equatorial
columns, and thereby to deduce from their relative tempera-
t ires the higher level of the former, and the consequent impos-
sibility of the thermal circulation as making the poleward upper
flow run uphill, than he would have to deduce the excess of
level of the Black Sea from its lower salinity, and to assert that
an inward underflow of ^Ejean water is impossible, as tending
to raise that level yet higher.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
But there is yet another serious error in Mr. Croll's compu-
tation, which, even admitting his fundamental assumption, com-
pletely invalidates his conclusion. lie has entirely omitted the
consideration of the inferior salinity of the Equatorial column;
which, as it shows itself alike at the surface and at the bottom,
may be fairly taken as characterising its entire height. This
will make a difference in the opposite direction of about one foot
in 1,026; sufficient, therefore, if the excess in the North At-
lantic column extends to a depth of no more than 600 fathoms,
to neutralise the whole 3} feet of elevation which Mr. Croll
deduces from relative temperatures.
Mr. Croll is unable to see what the "viscosity " of water has
to do with the question. Just this—that it affects his whole doc-
trine of "gradients." The nearer water is to a "perfect fluid,"
the less is the gradient required to give it horizontal motion.
If a viscous fluid be drawn from the bottom of one end, ,4, of a
long trough A—B, its level at B will be lowered more slowly than
at A, and will remain appreciably higher so long as the outflow
continues. But in the case of a "perfect fluid" and a slow
outflow, the level will practically fall simultaneously along the
whole length of the trough A—B. I am quite aware that, mathe-

tion of <f>' has almost entirely to be considered in 2. It is this
which constitutes the chief difference between the sliding and
the fixed seat, and which accounts for the sense of fatigue expe-
rienced in the legs in the former system.
If we examine the problems which arise from the considera-
tion of Fig. I we shall find that in using the term "fixed seat"
we are speaking incorrectly; that is to say, as far as there exists
a force to hold A in position we have none but friction; and
that practically the position of A with regard to L is determined
by muscular action.
Thus in Fig. 2 the seat is really more fixed than in Fig. I, or
there is less muscular action round t' than round T.
The advantages of the system 2 over 1 are however not
simply mechanical, but the constancy of the angle a affords
greater space for the respiratory movements, and thus physio-
logically there is an explanation for the difference in disturbance
of circulation and respiration generally experienced when com-
paring the two systems. R, J. Lee

Now, with respect to the primitive forms suggested by Mr.
Bonnisthorpe, the 2 would seem to have been two strokes at
right angles (not parallel), the lower stroke of our form being
only a tail, like that of many medial forms of Hebrew letters.
The 3 may have been originally three vertical strokes, which
were set horizontal in early times; the flat tip, however, does
not appear till 1574, and then only io English examples appa-

then about 1550 the straight tail was curved towards the previous
figure, and the head elongited to lead, to the next mirk. It
often occurs as a perfect though very straightened S in the s'x-
teenth century, as it is now made in Belgium and other coun-
ties. Its form in 12S0 reminds one of the Roman V written
as U. 6 in the Abacus consists of six strokes; but th's, from
their cumbrous collocation, is probably merely a scribe's fancy.

It may, however, prove to be a variable star of long period,
like the 8th magnitude orange-coloured star remarked by
the same observer near Procyon in the autumn of 1833,
the existence of which is supported by the observation of
Mr. Isaac Fletcher, as described in Smyth's Sidereal
Chromatics and elsewhere, and we believe by the experi-
ence of the Rev. T. W. Webb. There is now a stir of
the 9th magnitude, following p Cassiopea?, i;1 2 and 15' 3S"

the "Durchmusterung," there estimated 95, a consider-
ably fainter object than an average 9th magnitude in
Bessel's scale; its place would appear to correspond
better with that of Smyth's star following his 6th magni-
tude, nearly on the parallel, than with that of the missing
one. Probably this small star may be variable also; its
place for the beginning of the present year is R.A.

Smyth thought his 6th magnitude star, omitted by
Piazzi, might have had "something to do with the mis-
takes of Flamsteed respecting/1, alluded to by Mr. Baily."
These mistakes seem rather to have originated in the

doubted if the place of the latter, which he gives from
Halley's edition of 1712, could be depended upon, it will
be found to agree very well with that of fi carried back

actions to which they have been subjected. Hence, it is
argued, they must have been suspended in the air by
some force to allow time for these alternate actions to
take effect. Is the force in question not that of elec-
tricity? Let us suppose two clouds, superimposed the
one above the other, to be charged with opposite electri-
cities; if the crystals of ice which are often to be met with
in the upper regions of the atmosphere happen to be in
the interval between the two clouds, they will be attracted
by the nearest, and thereafter repelled as soon as they
have received by contact the electricity with which it is
charged. Instantly being attracted by the other cloud,
they rush towards it and are immediately charged with
the opposite electricity; and this alternate play, during
which the hailstones receive successive accretions from
the vapour abstracted from the clouds and congealed by
the cold of the original hailstone or of the space inter-
vening, will go on till the hailstones acquire a weight too
great for them to be any longer suspended, or till an elec-
tric discharge has destroyed the opposite electricities
which have accumulated on the surfaces of the clouds.

At this instant the hailstones fall to the ground by the
simple effect of their own weight.
To the same cause the formation of waterspouts has
been attributed. Let us suppose a low cloud highly
charged with electricity and producing by induction on
the water of the sea a powerful accumulation of statical
electricity of the opposite sign on its surface. The mu-
tual attraction of these two electricities, the cloud on the
one hand, the sea on the other, while powerless to pro-
duce contact, will nevertheless give rise to two opposing
protuberances in the oppositely electrified bodies. At
that point the electricities will acquire a tension the
greater as the protuberances continue to assume forms
more elongated. As the attractive action goes on increasing,
these two protuberances will gradually approach each
other between the sky and the earth, and will ultimately
unite, the protuberance descending from the sky passing
over a greater space than the other. Then, by the con-
ductor thus quickly formed of water and an elongated
fragment of cloud, the electricity of the upper regions
will escape into the ground, exerting a destructive action
over all obstacles in its way. It is also to be noted that
the instant when the waterspout is thus completed,
thunder ceases to roll in the clouds, the reason being
that the electricity has found a silent mode of escape.

M. Peltier, the accomplished physicist to whom science
is indebted for many ingenious researches on atmospheric
electricity, endeavoured to reproduce in miniature the
phenomenon thus described; but in bringing a highly
electrified conductor close to the surface of a sheet of
water, he was unable to show any other sensible mechani-
cal effect than a more rapid evaporation.
We shall not, however, insist on the electrical theory of
waterspouts. The theory is now rejected, equally with
the electrical theory of hail, because if a few waterspouts
have exhibited traces of an electrical action, the greater
part of the observed facts show nothing of it. Water-
spouts and typhoons are mechanical phenomena, in which
electricity plays not the principal part, but a part alto-
gether subordinate. There was a time when the tendency
was to explain everything in meteorology by electricity.
Whenever any question became obscure, electricity was
resorted to as a convenient explanation, and any difficult
point was considered as cleared up by an adroit appeal to
some laboratory experiment—such as the explanation of

earth's rotation, which diverts these currents from the
direction of the meridians, we have there the true cause
of the trade winds of the high regions, of which the
lower trade winds are only the counterpart and the
result. The lower trade winds are ordinarily attri-
buted to an equatorial rarefaction and to the indraught
which results from it. On this account, the indraught
being direct and ceasing with the day, the lower trade
winds ought to show, just as sea and land breezes, an
alternation from day to night, of which there exists no
trace. In considering the trade winds, on the contrary,
as the indirect result of the draining effected in the region
of the upper strata, we see that the intermediate mass
plays the part of the air receiver of a hydraulic machine,
which, by annihilating differences of velocity, produces a
steady flow, but which placed under the direct action of
the motive power would have been intermittent.
The theory of indraught or aspiration represents, on
the contrary, vast regular currents of the atmosphere as

ascends, and thereafter takes a course to north and to
south. The proof that matters do not take place alto-
gether in this way, and that the expansion of the air on
all sides in the zone most highly heated by the sun does
not there upset the order and the statical superposition of
the strata, is astronomical refraction, whose laws are the
same at the equator as in temperate regions; there is in
addition the perfect regularity and the smallness of the
barometric oscillations—conditions little compatible with
those of a colossal updraught, or even with the behaviour
of the trade winds, which no one has ever seen at the
confines of the zone of calms begin to assume a vertical
direction.
If we have at length succeeded in dispelling the idea of
vertical aspiration from which has been deduced the direct
cause of all aerial currents and all tempests, and the idea
of electricity considered as the chief agent in the mecha-

with dynamical pressure in a medium traversed through-

Vortices or Eddies with their Axes vertical to the Current
of Water.—If the question exclusively concerned pure
mechanics or mathematics, we should be stopped at the
very threshold of the inquiry, because mechanics does
not yet embrace the study of gyratory movements in
liquids or fluids. We have not up to the present moment
succeeded in submitting to analysis exact problems of
hydrodynamics, unless in very special cases in which
we may consider fluids as composed of elements of
volume containing always the same molecules, of such
sort that their masses are invariable and that the mole-
cules situated at the surface or on any of the sides will
always remain at the surface or at the same side. Be-
sides, the trajectories of the liquid filaments ought never
to present those re-entering or spiral-like curves which we,
however, so frequently remark. If we set out with these
restrictive hypotheses, the question cannot be attacked
by analysis. In other words, we are forced absolutely to

funnel-shaped figure and circulatory movement of the
entire mass and the increase of velocity towards the
centre will be at once seen.
The descending movement of these whirls may be
examined by the preceding analysis, but observationjias
long since placed the matter beyond doubt. Everyone
knows how much eddies in the current of a river are
dreaded by bathers ; when a swimmer has the misfor-
tune to be caught in one he is drawn down by a rapid
rotation even to the bottom of the water. There, the
expert swimmer, knowing how to reserve his strength in
place of expending it in useless efforts, extricates himself
by resting on the bottom, and, disengaging himself from
the eddy, rises quickly to the surface. Not only may men
be thus engulphed, but masses of floating ice, or even
small vessels, are drawn to the bottom by whirlpools, and
thereafter are extricated and rise to the surface only by
the obstacle afforded by the bottom, and by the contrac-
tion downwards, more and more marked, of the whirling
mass of water.
These phenomena can be artificially produced in a

large mass of still water, at a part where a rapid move-
ment of gyration is communicated by a suitable mechani-
cal appliance.'*' If we strew dust on the surface, in order
to render the phenomena visible, it is seen that gyration
is propagated in the form of a cone from above down-
wards, even to the bottom of the vessel, drawing the dust
along with it. Count Xavier de Maistre, who has pub-
lished in the Iiibliothlque Universelle de Geneve some
interesting experiments on this subject, has shown that a
layer of oil placed over the water of the funnel-shaped
eddy is drawn towards the bottom by a gyratory move-
ment; then, when it comes in contact with the obstacle
presented by the base, the oil reascends in globules all
round the eddy which it has quitted. There is thus here
a double vertical movement—the first regularly descending
along the spires of a conical helix, the second ascending
and exhibiting in its ascent no geometrical figure, but
rising to the surface irregularly round about the eddy. It
is natural that the liquid thus drawn to the bottom should
thereafter ascend more or less, not, be it noted, in the eddy
down which it had been carried, but outside it, through
the surrounding liquid.
This gyratory movement, which thus concentrates
towards the point of the eddy the sum of the moving
forces which the funnel-shaped whirl embraces in its vast

expanse, ought to produce at its base a certain amount of
mechanical work, and observation confirms this idea.
The powerful whirlpools of our rivers plough up their
beds and thus expend on the soil the force which they
have acquired near the surface at the expense of the
inequalities of velocity of the general current. And as all
currents of water possessing some little depth present like
inequalities of velocity among their lateral filaments, on
account of the friction of the water against the banks,
numerous whirlpools are constantly found whose action
consists in finally absorbing these inequalities and regu-
lating the flow of the water, so that the general velocity
of the river is perceptibly reduced.
Vortices ot Eddies with Vertical Axes in Gases.—All
these phenomena are found in gaseous masses traversed
by horizontal currents. In currents of this sort, inequali-
ties of velocity will equally give rise to whirling move-
ments round a vertical axis, and, as may be constantly
observed, these gyrations will still assume the figure of a
truncated cone in an inverted position, which becomes
visible when any circumstance occurs to interfere with

ocular and the small plane mirror round the axis of the
tube by a very simple process. The reason of this arrange-
ment is to facilitate the use of the large iron winding
staircase. This enormous metallic structure is moved by
special machinery on two circular iron rails. It is always
placed on the same side of the tube as the counterpoise,
which would render observations impossible if the .ocular
and seeker were not rotated round the axis of the tube.
The height of the iron staircase is about twelve metres,
and its weight six tons. The observations are made in
open air, and when the weather is propitious the cabin
protecting the apparatus is removed by machinery. It is
an iron casement (weight twelve tons), moveable on rails.
In less than a quarter of an hour the telescope can be
directed on any object, however minute.
The clock is finished, but not adjusted. The machinery
for moving in right ascension is finished and works ad-
mirably. The handle and screws for minute motions in
declination are finished and working most nicely. So
does the gear for connecting and disconnecting the tube
with the clock.

LIEUT. WEYPRECHT ON ARCTIC EXPLORA-
TION
WE have already (vol. xii. p. 460) referred to Lieut.
Weyprecht's paper on the Principles of Arctic
Exploration, read at the German Scientific and Medical
Association. A full report of the paper has now come to
hand. Lieut. Weyprecht rightly maintains that the polar
regions offer, in certain important respects, greater advan-
tages than any other part of the globe for the observations of
natural phenomena—magnetism, the aurora, meteorology,

geology, zoology, and botany. He shows that hitherto
immense sums have been spent and much hardship suf-
fered for the mere purpose of extending geographical and
topographical knowledge, while strictly scientific observa-
tions were regarded as holding only a secondary place.
While admitting the importance of geographical discovery,
he maintains that the main purpose of future Arctic expe-
ditions should be the extension of our knowledge of the
various natural phenomena which may be studied with
so great advantage in these regions.
After showing in some detail the kind of observations
which would yield valuable results, Lieut. Weyprecht lays
down the following general propositions :—1. Arctic
exploration is of the highest importance to a knowledge
of the laws of nature. 2. Geographical discovery in these
regions is of superior importance only in so far as it
extends the field for scientific investigation in its strict
sense. 3. Minute Arctic topography is of secondary
importance. 4. The geographical pole has for science
no greater significance than any other point in high lati-
tude. 5. Observation-stations are to be selected without

in the Telegraph of Friday and Monday last. As might be
expected, they are full of interest, and contain many geographical
details, too summarily stated, however, to be condensed intelli-
gibly, or appreciated without a special map. Such a map Mr.
Stanley seems to have sent home, and we hope it will be pub-
lished as soon as practicable. Both letters are written from the
"village of Kagehyi, district of Uchambi, country of Usukuma,
on the Victoria Niyanza " (so he spells the name), dated March 1
and May 15 respectively. An intervening letter has not come
to hand. The lake was reached after a march of 720 miics from
the coast, in 103 days. That the expedition has had to encounter
more than the usual,difficulties and hardships of African explo-
ration may be inferred from the fact that Stanley has lost con.
siderably more than half his men, including two of his white
companions, Frederick Barker and Edward Pocock. Disease
carried off the greater number, though many were lost in a fierce
fight with the Waturu, a people of the Leewumbu Valley. The
principal addi'.ions to our knowledge made so far by the deter-
mined leader of the expedition is a pretty full account of the
country and the people from Western Ugogo northwards to
Nyanza, and a survey of over 1,000 miles of the shores of the
lake, which apparently is studded with islands. The Shemeeyu
River, known by other names in the upper part of its course,
which Stanley seems mainly to have followed, and which he
regards as the chief tributary of the Nyanza, enters the lake at
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the village of Kagehyi. Stanley calculates its length roughly at
350 miles. At 400 miles from the coast he came upon the base
of the watershed of a number of streams which feed the river, and
which he evidently regards as at least one of the Nile sources.
According to Stanley's observations, and they seem to have been
carefully made, as computed by Capt. George, the height of the
Nyanza above sea-level is 3,740 feet—68 feet higher than Speke
made it out to be. He has made some other corrections on
Speke's observations, especially in the matter of latitude.
Speke he makes out to be fourteen miles wrong in his latitude
along the whole of the coast of Uganda. The mouth ol the
Katonga, for example, which in his map is a little south of the
equator, Stanley makes by meridian altitude to be in N. lat.
0° 16'. We sincerely hope the indomitable leader of this ex-
pedition will be able successfully to accomplish the large task
he has set before him—the exploration of the whole of the lake
region of Central Africa.

used as food ; they are carried from place" to place in junks laden

nomy is exercised than was formerly the case. In the olive-

From the Report, dated June 1875, of Mr. George King,

during the past year many important improvements have been

being erected. This noble conservatory, when finished, will, it
is expected, be the greatest addition to the Garden which has been

made for years, and will give facilities for the cultivation of deli-
cate plants hitherto unknown in Calcutta. This building is 200
feet in length by 66 feet broad. The collections in the two
orchid houses and in the other conservatories have been much
increased during the year, considerable additions having been
received from Sikkim, the Khasi Hills, the Andaman?, and
Burmah, also a lew plants from the Neilgherrics. A number of
plants were also sent to the Garden by Mr. Lister, the second
gardener, who accompanied the Duflla field-force as a botanicil
collector. "But," Mr. King justly remarks, in reference to this,
"when the floral wealth of Assam, of Eastern Bengal, and of
Burmah is considered, not to mention the west and south of
India, the collection in this Garden appears miserably small. In
an imperial institution such as this, the natural productions of
the whole Indian empire should, as far as the climate will per-
mit, be represented. I see no way of forming such a typical
collection until a good trained European col'ector be attached
permanently to the establishment. At present I have to rely for
supplies of plants from distant paits of India on correspondence
with private parties, who, although usually very willing to help,
are unfortunately often unskilled in botany or gardening, and
neither know what plants to send nor how to pack them safely
for transit. The only experts, not employed in the Garden,
whose services I can command for collecting, are the manager of
the Cinchona plantation and his assistants, and their efforts are

of course confined to Sikkim. Had I a collector as one of the
regular garden staff, I could send him about to distant districts
of which the flora is little known or poorly represented in the
Garden, and the result would be that in a few years a very fine
collection might be got together both of living plants in cultiva-
tion and of dried specimensjin the Herbarium. Another great
advantage would be that this Garden would be put in a position
such as it has not hitherto occupied for exchanging plants with
similar institutions all over the world. The cost of maintaining
such a collector would not be great, and the extremely liberal
manner in which the Gardens have been' supported by Govern-
ment during the past year leads me to hope that this desideratum
will soon be supplied."

During the meeting of the Social Science Congress at
Brighton, Mr. Booth threw open for three days his private mu-
seum which is m the course of arrangement. He has built on
the Dyke Road a spacious^ hall of brick, lighted entirely from
above, and around this arc being placed 306 cases which contain
groups of birds shot by himself and Mrs. Booth in Britain.
There is one point about the fixing of the cases worth mention-
ing. A framework is constructed about three feet from the wall
into which the glazed cases fit. This prevents any damp from the
walls, too frequent in museums, and allows of the easy moving
of the cases if needed. As these cases are arranged in three
tiers only and there is abundance of light, every bird can be well
seen, and the width of the hall is sufficient to admit of viewing
the groups from different positions. The most important feature
next perhaps to the careful stuffing of the birds, is the fidelity with
which the characters of the habitat are reproduced. With birds
which change their plumage during the year, two, and where
needed, three illustrations are given each with the proper
entourage. As a collection illustrating our British birds in their
native haunts, this is probably unique. There is no attempt at
zoological classification, however, since the position of the cases

is influenced rather by their relative size and the general
picturesque effect of the hall. Whoever the taxidermist is, the
collection does him great credit. It is stated that when com-
plete the collection will be thrown open to the public lor the

NATURE
The water-closets in the houses are situated on the middle and
basement floors. The continuous water supply flushes them
without danger of charging the drinking water with gases
emanating from the closet; a danger so imminent in the pre-
sent method of cisterns, which supply drinking as well as flushing
water.
As we walk the streets of our model city, we notice first an
absence of places for the public sale, of spirituous liquors.
Whether this be a voluntary purgation in goodly imitation of
the National Temperance League, the effect of Sir Wilfred
Lawson's Permissive liill and must permissive wit and wisdom,
or the work of the Good Templars, we need not stay to inquire.
We look at the fact only. To this citv, as to the town of St.
Johnsbury, in Vermont, which Mr. Hepworth Dixon has so
graphically described, we may apply the description Mr. Dixon
has written: "No bar, no dram shop, no saloon defiles the
place. Nor is there a single gaming hell or house of ill-repute."
Through all the workshops into which we pass, irr whatever
l.ibour the men or women may be occupied—and the place is
noted for its manufacturing industry—at whatever degree of
heat or cold, strong drink is unknown. Practically, wc are in

a total abstainers' town, and a man seen intoxicated would be
so avoided by the whole community, he would have no peace to
remain.
And, as smoking and drinking go largely together, as the two
practices were, indeed, original exchanges of social degradations
between the civilised man and the savage, the savage getting
very much the worst of the bargain, so the practices largely dis-
appear together. Pipe and glass, cigar and sherry-cobbler, like
the Siamese twins, who could only live connected, have both
died in our model city. Tobacco, by far the most innocent
partner of the firm, lived, as it perhaps deserved to do, a little
the longest ; but it passed away, and the tobacconist's counter,
like the dram counter, has disappeared.
The streets of our city, though sufficiently fillei with busy
people, are comparatively silent. The subways relieve the
heavy traffic, and the factories are all at short distances from
the town, except those in which the work that is carried on is
silent and free from nuis:ance. This brings me to speak of
some of the public buildings which have relation to our present
studies.
It has been found in our towns, generally, that men and
women who are engaged in industrial callings, such as tailoring,
shoe-making, dress-making, lace-work and the like, work at their
own homes amongst their children. That this is a common
cause of disease is well understood. I have myself seen the
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
half-made riding-habit that was ultimately to clothe some wealthy
damsel rejoicing in her morning ride, act as the coverlet of a poor
tailor's child stricken with malignant scarlet-fever. These things
must be in the ordinary course of events, under our present bad
ordinary system. In the model city we have in our mind's eye,
these dangers are met by the simple provision of workmen's
offices or workrooms. In convenient parts of the town there are
blocks of buildings, designed mainly after the manner of the
houses, in which each workman can have a work-room on pay-
ment of a moderate sum per week. Here he may work as
many hours as he pleases, but he may not transform the room
into a home. Each block is under the charge of a superin-
tendent, and also under the observation of the sanitary authori-
ties. The family is thus separated from the work, and the
working man is secured the same advantages as the lawyer, the
merchant, the banker now possesses: or, to make the parallel
more correct, he has the same advantage as the man or woman
who works in a factory and goes home to eat and to sleep.
In most towns throughout the kingdom the laundry system is
dangerous in the extreme. For anything the healthy house-
holder knows, the clothes he and his children wear have been

important public places. It has an ambulance always ready to
be sent out to bring any injured persons to the institution. The
ambulance drives straight into the hospital, where a bed of the
same height on silent wheels, so that it can be moved without
vibration into a ward, receives the patient.
The kitchens, laundries, and laboratories are in a separate
block at the back of the institution, but are connected with it by
the central corridor. The kitchen and laundries are at the top
of this building, the laboratories below. The disinfecting-room
is close to the engine-room, and superheated steam, which the
engine supplies, is used for disinfection.
The out-patient department, which is apart from the body of
the hospital, resembles that of the Queen's Hospital, Birming-
ham : the first out-patient department, as far as I am aware, that
ever deserved to be seen by a generous public. The patients
waiting for advice are seated in a large hall, warmed at all
seasons to a proper heat, lighted from the top through a glass
roof, and perlectly ventilated. The infectious cases are separated
carefully from the rest. The consulting rooms of the medical
staff are comfortably fitted, the dispensary is thoroughly officered,
and the order that prevails is so effective that a sick person, who

is punctual to time, has never to wait.
The medical officers attached to the hospital in our model
city are allowed to hold but one appointment at the same time,
and that for a limited period. Thus every medical m:in in the
city obtains the equal advantage of hospital practice, and the
value of the best medical and surgical skill is fairly equalised
through the whole community.
In addition to the hospital building is a separate block, fur-
nished with wards, constructed in the same way as the general
wards, for the reception of children suffering from any of the
infectious diseases. These wards are so planned that the people,
generally, send sick members of their own family into them for
treatment, and pay for the privilege.
Supplementary to the hospital are certain other institutions of
a kindred character. To check the terrible course of infantile
mortality of other large cities—the 76 in the 1,000 of mortality
under five years of age, homes for little children are abundant.
In these the destitute young are carefully tended by intelligent
nurses ; and mothers, while following their daily callings, are
enabled to leave their children under efficient care.
In a city irom which that grand source of wild mirth, hope-
less sorrow and confirmed madness, alcohol, has been expelled,
it could hardly be expected that much insanity would be found.
The few who are insane are placed in houses licensed as asylums,
but not different in appearance to other houses in the city. Here
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
they live, in small communities, under proper medical super-
vision, with their own gardens and pastimes.
The houses of the helpless and aged are, like the asylums, the
same as the houses of the rest of the town. No large building
for the poor of pretentious style uprears itself; no men badged
and badgered as paupers walk the place. Those poor who are
really, from physical causes, unable to work, are maintained in a
manner showing that they possess yet the dignity of human
kind; that, being worth preservation, they are therefore worthy
of respectful tenderness. The rest, those who can work, are
employed in useful labours which pay for their board. If they
cannot find work, and are deserving, they may lodge in the
house and earn their subsistence; or they may live from the
house and receive pay for work done. If they will not work,
they, as vagrants, find a home in prison, where they are com-
pelled to share the common lot of mankind.
Our model city is of course well furnished with baths, swim-
ming baths, Turkish baths, playgrounds, gymnasia, libraries,
board schools, fine art schools, lecture halls, and places of in-
structive amusement. In every board school drill forms part of
the programme. I need not dwell on these subjects, but must

of the people lead them still to the earth, as the most fitting
resting-place into which, when lifeless, they should be drawn.
Thus the cemetery holds its place in our city, but in a form
much modified from the ordinary cemetery. The burial-ground
is artificially made of a fine carboniferous earth. Vegetation of
rapid growth is cultivated over it. The dead are placed in the
earth from the bier, either in basket-work, or simply in the
shroud; and the monumental slab, instead of being set over
or at the head or foot of a raised grave, is placed in a spacious
covered hall or temple, and records simply the fact that the per-
son commemorated was recommitted to earth in those grounds.
In a few months, indeed, no monument would indicate the
remains of any dead. In that rapidly-resolving soil the trans-
formation of dust into dust is too perfect to leave a trace of
residuum. The natural circle of transmutation is harmlessly
completed, and the economy of nature conserved.

ditions specified.
Two kinds of observation guide me in this essay: one derived
from statistical and sanitary work, the other from experience,
extended now over thirty years, of disease, its phenomena, its
origins, its causes, its terminations.
I infer, then, that in our model city certain forms of disease
would find no possible home, or, at the worst, a home so transient
as not to alTect the mortality in any serious degree. The infan-
tile diseases, infantile and remittent fevers, convulsions, diarrhoea,
croup, marasmus, dysentery, would, I calculate, be almost
unknown. Typhus and typhoid fevers and cholera could not, I
believe, exist in the city except temporarily and by pure acci-
dent ; small-pox would be kept under entire control; puerperal
fever and hospital fever would probably cease altogether ; rheu-
matic fever, induced by residence in damp houses, and the heart
disease subsequent upon it, would be removed; death from
privation and from puerpera and scurvy would certainly cease;
delirium tremens, liver disease, alcoholic phthisis, alcoholic
degeneration of kidney, and all the varied forms of paralysis,
insanity, and other affections due to alcohol, would be completely
effaced. The parasitic diseases arising from the introduction into
the body, through food, of the larva: of the entozoa, would
cease, and that large class of deaths from pulmonary consump-
tion, induced in less-favoured cities by exposure to impure air
and badly-ventilated rooms, would, I believe, be reduced so as

to bring down the mortality of this signally fatal malady one-
third at least.
Some diseases, pre-eminently those which arise from uncon-
trollable causes, from sudden fluctuations of temperature, electri-
cal storms, and similar great variations of nature, would remain
as active as ever; and pneumonia, bronchitis, congestion of the
lungs, and summer cholera would still hold their sway. Cancer,
also, and allied constitutional diseases of strong hereditary cha-
racter would yet, as far as we can see, prevail. I fear, more-
over, it must be admitted that two or three of the epidemic
diseases, notably scarlet fever, measles, and whooping-cough,
would assert themselves, and, though limited in their diffusion
by the sanitary provisions for arresting their progress, would
claim a considerable number of victims.
With these facts clearly in view, I must be careful not to claim
for my model city more than it deserves ; but calculating the
mortality which would be saved, and comparing the result with
the mortality which now prevails in the most favoured of our
large English towns, I conclude that an average mortality of
eight per thousand would be the maximum in the first generation
living under this salutary regime. That in a succeeding genera-

heat with depth took place at the rate of only zfo° R. instead
of -, £-3° R., the region of constant temperature would be reached
at 13,500 feet.
A similar diminution of the increase of heat with depth was
observed in the case of the boring at Grenelle ; but here the
depth reached was far less, and the diverse character of the rocks
passed through caused doubts to be entertained as to the accu-
racy of the result, t
In these results Trof. Mohr finds a strong confirmation of all
the objections that have been urged from other sides against the
Plutonistic theory. "The cause of the increasing heat in the
interior of the earth," he says, "must lie in the upper strata of
the earth's crust. . . . The theory of volcanoes must of course
adapt itself to the above results, and tha fluidity of the lavas is
not a part of the incandescence (no longer) present in the earth,
but a local evolution of heat by sinkings which have always been
produced by the sea and its action upon solid rocks, as indeed all
volcanoes are situated in or near the sea. This local superheating
of the volcanic foci contributes greatly to the internal heat of the
earth. For the internal nucleus of the earth can lose but little heat

outwards on account of the bad conductivity of the siliceous and
calcareous rocks, whilst, in the lapse of ages, it must propagate
uniformly all the heat-effects of the volcanoes, and thus a constant
elevated temperature must prevail in the interior, and therefore
we come to the conclusion that increase of heat in the interior of
the earth which is everywhere met with is the result of all pre-
ceding heat-actions, uniformly diffused by conduction in the
mternal nucleus of the earth." Further causes of terrestrial heat
are, according to Prof. Mohr, the formation of new crystalline
rocks from sun-warmed, infiltrated fluids, and also chemical
processes such as the evolution of carbonic acid by the contact
of oxide of iron with the remains of organisms, the formation of
pyrites and blendes by the reduction of sulphates in contact with
organic matters, the decomposition of lignite and coal, &c.

"development of the Mullerian duct explained. The way in
which the segmental organs, opening externally in Annelids, have
a ductal teimination in Vertebrates is discussed. It is analogous

a distribution of pressure must give rise to a cold Polar stream
flowing over the greater part of Europe. In Vienna the cold was
greatest between the 16th and the iSth, and then the high pres-
sure began to travel eastwards. This movement of the maximum
produced a great change. The Atlantic minima, instead of

SIXTH REPORT OF THE SCIENCE
COMMISSION
'T'HREE times within the last twelve years a Royal
-i- Commission has reported on the science teaching
of our higher schools. In 1864 the Public Schools Com-
mission announced that from the largest and most famous
schools of all it was practically excluded. In 1868 the
Endowed Schools Commission declared that the majority
of school teachers had accepted it as part of their school
work. The Science Commissioners of 1875, in their
Sixth Report, on Science Teaching in Schools, testing this
statement by inquiry, reports that of 128 endowed schools
examined by them not one-half has even attempted to
introduce it, while of these only 13 possess a laboratory,
and only 10 give to the subject as much as four hours a
week. And this statement is curiously illustrated by the
statistics of the recent Oxford and Cambridge School
Examination, which show that out of 461 candidates for
certificates from 40 first-class schools, while 438 boys
took up Latin, 433 Greek, 455 Elementary Mathematics,

In a volume whose research and condensation make it
not only a monument of conscientious toil, but an invalu-
able handbook to all who arc labouring to work out prac-
tically the great problem of which it treats, the Commis-
sioners investigate the obstacles which have caused the
endowed schools to defy the weighty recommendations of
former Commissions, the unanimous verdict of educa-
tional authorities outside the scholastic profession, and
the increasingly urgent demands of English public
opinion. They find the schoolmasters' excuses to be
threefold ; absence of funds, want of time, and scepticism
as to the educational value of science in comparison with
other subjects. A large portion of the Appendix is de-
voted to the consideration of these difficulties; to sifting
the allegations on which they rest, and to balancing
against them the experience of those teachers who have
faced and successfully met them. Showing in detail the
comparatively trifling cost at which indispensable appa-
ratus can be obtained, the Commissioners nevertheless
admit the rarity, in the present state of English culture,
either of independent science teachers suited to the larger
schools, or of men, such as poorer schools desiderate,
combining literary with scientific knowledge. This, how-
ever, is an evil of the past rather than of the future, since

not the least amongst the advantages expected from a
reformed system of school teaching is the creation of a
race of able teachers, general as well as special. The
relative value of science as an implement of mental train-
ing is next discussed. Its peculiar excellence is briefly
vindicated, as cultivating in a way attainable by no other
means the habits of observation and experiment, of clas-
sification, arrangement, method, judgment; and its suita-
bility to the capacities of the very youngest boys is
testified to by Faraday, Hooker, Rolleston, Carpen-
ter, and Sir W. Thomson. Lastly, it is shown that,
if this be so, the argument from want of time is no argu-
ment at all; that the hours are already wasted which

stupidity which is absolutely appalling." His scholarship
won, he is pledged to pursue a course whose benefits are
tangible and its evil consequences remote. The Univer-
sities have stamped upon all the schools one deep cer-
tainty, that for a boy to be "all round," as it is called, is
the irremissible sin; that a schoolmaster who teaches
with reference to intellectual growth and width of culture
sacrifices thereby all hope of the distinctions which make
a school famous and increase its numbers. If a classical
scholarship is desired, science and mathematics are
abandoned: nay, the palm of literary excellence
is conceded even to men ignorant of the noblest
literature in the world, their own birthright and in-
heritance, and knowing less of the history and structure
of the English language than a fourth form boy knows
of Greek. If mathematical success is aimed at, literature

and science are ignored; if the few science scholarships
existing tempt candidates from any of "the thirteen schools
which possess a laboratory," mathematics in part and
literature altogether must be given up. It would be waste
of words to point out the fatal tendency of this separative
process ; to show how mere linguistic training needs the
rationalising aid of scientific study, or how exclusive
science hardens and materialises without the refining
society of literature; yet such divorce is inevitably due
not to the convictions of schoolmasters, not to the in-
fluence of parents, not to the prepossessions of the public,
but to the irresistible force of the University system, which
makes nairowness of intelligence and imperfect knowledge
the only avenues to distinction or to profit.
It is true that an attempt to alter this involves little
short of a revolution; but by all accounts a revolution is
at hand. It is not for nothing that a parliamentary in-
vestigation into the expenditure of college endowments
should have been supported by members of the colleges
themselves, or that a proposal to distribute college scholar-
ships and exhibitions by a central authority in accordance
with the results of the leaving-examination should have
emanated from eminent university teachers. For it
cannot be too strongly urged that college scholarships
stand on very different ground from university prizes or

which shall control the latter once for all; it is not easy
to bind the actions of some forty different foundations,
each electing its own scholars according to its own
idiosyncrasies, or in obedience to the changing wills of
bodies in a perpetual state of flux. It may still be
audacious, but it is no longer novel, to suggest that,
supposing future legislation to retain the college scholar-
ships at all, they should be awarded by the authority of
Government, in strict connection with leaving-exami-
nations which Government shall conduct, and in reward
not of special but of general proficiency. For this the
scheme of the Commissioners virtually contends; into
regions beyond this the Report before us necessarily does
not enter.
It will be seen that we accept, and recommend all
teachers to accept, the scheme of the Commissioners

JMATURE
It is a perfect mine of information about the Kasbmirian
territories, more especially about their physical and
political geography and their ethnology, while occasional
details are introduced as to their zoology and botany. Mr.
Drew delivers a "plain unvarnished tale," and has made
no attempt to work his materials up into a merely popular
book. Indeed, it might have been an advantage had he
exercised a little more skill in arrangement; but with this
defect we are not disposed to find serious fault, as every
page of the work contains valuable information, which,
by means of contents and index, is, alter all, easily got
at. Mr. Drew has made a substantial contribution to
our knowledge of one of the most interesting regions of
the globe.
Most Europeans, we suspect, have but a vague notion
of how much is included under the name Kashmir.
After all, Jummoo has a better title to give a name to the
dominions of the Maharaja, as it is in the capital of this
district that he resides. Jummoo is quite near the
southern boundary of the Kashmirian territories, on a
branch of the Chinab river, and hence must arise many

inconveniences in the government of the country.
The territory included under the sway of the Maharaja
is somewhat extensive, and of great variety in climate,
physical characteristics, and races, extending from the
broiling plains of the Panjab to the immense glaciers and
eternal snows of the highest Himalayas, and including
peoples both of Aryan and Turanian affinities, and of
Mohammedan, Buddhist, and Brahman faiths. Looking
down, however, upon the general map which accompanies
Mr. Drew's volume, it is seen that the great mass of the
territory is distinctly mountainous, and that to such an
extent that one wonders where there can be any room for
a population at all. Besides Jummoo and Kashmir, the
countries of Ladakh, Baltistao, and Gilgit are included in
the Maharaja's territories, whose entire area is estimated
at 68,000 square miles.
Mr. Drew's plan is first in an introduction to present a
general view of the Kashmirian territories, and then in
succeeding chapters to treat of the various districts. The
High Himalayan peaks east of Nubra.
main characteristics of each district and its inhabitants
are described in some detail, after which Mr. Drew takes
the reader along a particular route which he himself has
traversed, pointing out with great minuteness all that is
worthy of note by the way. As Mr. Drew records mainly
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
his own experiences, and as he is seldom tempted aside
from the record of facts, it will be seen that the work is
well adapted to afford the reader a clear and full idea of
a region that is well worth becoming intimately acquainted
with.
Mr. Drew divides the entire territory from a physical
point of view into three regions, commencing at the plain
of the Panjab and proceeding northwards. These are,
first, the region of the Outer Hills, composed of moun-
tains averaging from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above sea-level;
second, the Middle Mountains, averaging between 8,000
and 10,000 feet ; and lastly, the region of the lofty Hima-
layas, the mountains in which vary in height from 15,000
to 27,000 feet. There are many points in Mr. Drew's
descriptions into which we wish we could enter in some
detail, many observations concerning the country and the
people we should like to lay before our readers, but this
is impossible; a mere enumeration of the contents of the
work would occupy most of the space at our command.
Of the inhabitants especially of this curious region, so
near the supposed cradle of the Aryan race, and where

of interest. He throws some light also on the probable
origin of castes, and especially of the distinction between
the superior and inferior castes, and produces some very
good reasons for believing that they are a result of the
conquest of an inferior by a superior race. Mr. Drew
was governor of Ladakh for a period, and thus had a
splendid opportunity of becoming acquainted with an in-
teresting region and curious people. He of course refers
to the peculiar marital institution of the Turanians in
the comparatively barren districts of the Himalayas. In
Baltistan the people are of the same race as the Ladakhis,
but having been converted to Mohammedanism, have
eschewed polyandry for polygyny, with the result that
the population has increased beyond the capacity of the
country to support it, rendering emigration necessary.
Mr. Drew presents minute studies of several places in
Ladakh, especially of the salt lake district to the south of
Leh. After carefully observing the geological charac-
teristics of the district, he concludes that at one time, when
glaciers were more universal than now, there must have
been there one extensive and deep lake. Mr. Drew is con-

stantly turning aside to make minute studies in geology
and physical geography of this kind, and as the pheno-
menon investigated is generally of a typical sort, the scien-
tific value of the book is thus much enhanced.
Of course Mr. Drew has a great deal to say about the
Himalayas and their glaciers—glaciers on a scale, as he
says, not to be met with elsewhere beyond the Arctic
regions. Though Mr. Drew's style is unadorned, it has the
merit of being always perfectly clear, so that his descriptions
of glacial and other phenomena convey real and valuable
information. One glacier he examined at Basha, in
Baltistan, was upwards of twenty miles long, and others
are to be met with of much greater extent; indeed, to
judge from the map, this north-west Himalayan region
is one huge net-work of glaciers. The largest of all is

low range of mountains running east and west, the

may be regarded as conclusive of a number of questions
regarding which there has of late been much discussion
concerning the ocean currents in these regions, the direc-
tion of which, in the absence of other data, it has been
attempted to determine chiefly by the temperature of the

Scharr to Jugor Sound, and thence past Cape Grebeni to
75-i0 N. lat. and 820 E. long., and on to the mouth of

sea the temperature of the sea-water at the surface is
exceedingly variable and dependent upon the temperature
of the air, upon the neighbourhood of ice, and upon the
influx of warm fresh water from Obi and Jenesej, but that
the temperature of the water at a depth of only ten
fathoms is nearly quite constant, between — i° and 2° C.

If, in the northern part of the Sea of Kara, where the
water on the surface is almost completely free of salt, and
at this time of the year very warm, a flask filled with
water from the surface is sunk to a depth of ten fathoms,
the water freezes to ice. There are thus no warm ocean
currents here at any considerable depth below the sur-
face. A large number of deep-water samples have been
taken by the apparatus constructed by Prof. Ekman,
which is exceedingly well adapted for the purpose,

salt is also constant, which can be ascertained with cer-

the samples of water which have been taken.

2 would decrease k still further, and here exists for the
present an unsolved contradiction between experience and
the theory in its present form.
Looking at this state of things, Herren Kundt and
Warburg at Strasburg thought it advisable to investigate
experimentally the simplest case which nature offers to
us, viz. the case of a gas which, according to its chemical
behaviour, is a monatomic one. HerrBaeyer pointed out
to them that mercury gas was such a gas; they there-
fore undertook to determine the specific heat of mercury
gas. Here a contradiction to the theofy did not become
apparent; the experiment has yielded exactly the value
demanded by theory for a monatomic gas, viz., K = 1 67.
Thus it is proved that the molecule of mercury gas, with
regard to its thermal and mechanical properties, behaves
exactly like a material point. It is hardly necessary to
remark that, with regard to other properties, it is not at all
necessary that the; same molecule should behave like a
material point. Thus, for instance, one glance at the spec-
trum emitted by incandescent mercury gas, which is
crossed by many bright lines, shows us at once that the

molecule of the same, with regard to the light it emits,
does certainly not behave like a material point.
With regard to the way in which the experiment was
conducted, we confine ourselves to the following remarks.
The k for mercury gas was determined from the velocity
of sound in this gas, and this was found by means of the
method of dust figures, formerly described by Herr
Kundt.* A glass tube a, closed at both ends, well dried
and pumped perfectly free from air, contained a certain
quantity of mercury, which had been carefully weighed,
and a little silicic acid. Sealed to this tube was another
one, b (this a little narrower), in such a manner as to form
the prolongation of a. a was placed in a four-fold box
made of iron plates, which was heated by a series of
Bunsen burners. This box also contained the great
reservoir of an air thermometer, and, if observations were
made at a temperature under 3540, several mercury ther-
mometers besides. The end of B, projecting from the
box, was sealed up, and over this end a long wide glass
tube D was placed, which was closed at one end and con-
tained a little lycopodium.
If now, after the necessary regulation in the heating
arrangements, the thermometers in the box showed equal
and sufficiently elevated temperatures, the tube composed
of A and B was sounded by friction to its third longitu-

dinal tone; at the same time a reading of the air thermo-
meter was taken, and the temperature of the air in D was
noted down. The powders introduced then showed in
tubes A and D the sound-waves in mercury gas and in air
respectively, so that afterwards the lengths of these waves
could be measured with the greatest accuracy.

he makes no mention of the second), though all the

the line drawn from an angle of the squire to the middle
point of one of the opposite sides. In his "Ge'ome'trie"

quelles un ge'ome'trien ne cognoist, et ne confesseroit
jamais estre possibles. Nonobstant, son invention est
bonne et approuvee, tant par raison que par experience."
Nor do we find any account of his quadrature agreeing
with that of a peasant labourer, but he states that he too

had attempted the problem by another method (than that
of Cusa), and not without success. Whilst standing on a
bridge at Paris he noticed the carriage-wheels passing
over the road; the fact that when the wheel has per-
formed a revolution we have a straight line whose length
equals the circumference of the wheel, suggested his solu-
tion to him, and on his return home he easily got his
construction, which is this: Divide a radius of the circle
into four equal parts, produce this radius through a fourth
of its length ; join the extremity of this line with an ex-
tremity of the diameter at right angles to the radius, and
with the point as centre and this distance as radius
describe a circle; the portion of the tangent at the ex-
tremity of the selected radius cut off by this circle, he
says, equals the semi-circumference. It will be seen that
this is the same value as that given above. Bovillus,
also, in a libellus de mathemalicis supplementis (1509),
gives a third construction, which leads to the same value.
Before leaving this writer we ought to state that he
attributes the first construction we have given to his
friend M. Achaire Barbel, a man "ingenious at new
inventions of use in geometry." It is with considerable
diffidence that we have ventured to go thus into detail,
but it seems to us that De Morgan had fallen into error
in the case of this early writer.

with some well-devised scheme'of international observa-

rate general representation of atmospheric pressure, tem-
perature, humidity and aqueous precipitation, together
with the movements of the air as indicated by the direc-

These large inquiries naturally fall into two groups.
The first group is concerned almost exclusively with the
great movements of the atmosphere, and it is the adequate
investigation of these inquiries which is aimed at by the
United States Government in their great scheme of ob-
servations made at the same physical instant over the

above, be called international. It includes those inquiries
which deal with the large and vitally important subject of
comparative climatology, or a comparison of the climates
of different countries and regions, and of their meteorology

generally, inclusive of the great movements of the atmo-
sphere over a restricted portion of the globe, such as the
United States, the North Atlantic, or Europe. It is alto-
gether essential to the discussion of those inquiries which
fall under this head that the observations be made at the
same local time and with instruments so constructed and
placed as toy give results strictly comparable with each
other. It is evident that the exposure of the thermometers,
including their immediate surroundings and height above
the ground, must be uniform in all countries; otherwise
the observations, being incomparable, cannot be used in
questions of international meteorology.
Of the recurring meteorological phenomena which
first and most imperatively require to be dealt with inter-

physics and from their intimate bearings on animal and
vegetable life, are the daily changes which take place in
the temperature, humidity, pressure, and movements of

of Ireland, the elevated plateaux of Spain, and the exten-

with Prof. Plantamour in thinking that during recent
years the study of the movements of the atmosphere has
been too exclusively directed with a view to the applica-
tion of the results to the prediction of storms on the
coasts and to the system of storm-warnings, and that
other points of view have been completely abandoned
(Report, p. 58). It is right, however, to add that this
neglect may be excused on the ground that, as there is an
entire want of uniformity in the hours and modes of ob-
serving in the systems of meteorology as pursued in the
different countries of Europe, the data for the investiga-
tions of nearly all the important questions of international
meteorology do not exist

Assembly and a Professor of Physiology at the Sorbonne, for his
discoveries relating to the part played by oxygen in the act
of respiration. Although the report was presented to the
Academy of Sciences at a secret sitting, it is expected that it
will be published shortly, as the noblest part of the award is not
the gift of a handsome sum of money, but the reasons why the
prize had been adjudged to the candidate. After this the report
for the prize established by the celebrated Volney was read at

that if circumstances continue equally favourable the pole may
be reached this year. The expedition is not expected home,

A PAPER of considerable interest, by Dr. Daniel Wilson,
has been reprinted from the Canadian Journal. Its title
is "Hybridity and Absorption in relation to the Red Indian
Race." Dr. Wilson, while of course admitting the patent
fnct that the American Indians, like most other barbarous
races, have largely melted away before the white races,
thinks that in accounting for this too much stress has
been laid on mere extermination. He adduces data to prove
that a very considerable proportion of red blood has been
absorbed into the whites of North America, and that especially
in the Canadian Dominion this shows itself in the physiognomy
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of all classes. It would be difficult, he believes, to find either
In the United States or in Canada many Indians of pure breed.
In Canada half-breeds ate the almost universal representatives of
the tormer Indian tribes, and many of them are settling down to
a steady civilised life. In short, Dr. Wilson has what appears
to us a well-founded belief that the aborigines of North America
are being gradually absorbed into the dominant race, and that in
course of time they will have become as integral a part of the
population as any one of the elements which may be traced in
the population of Europe, and that their physical and mental
characteristics will tell upon the American character—just as
Melanochroic attributes have left marked traces on the intrusive
Xanthochroic European peoples. Fortunately the evidence gives
pood ground for believing that this influence is decidedly good,
physically and intellectually. The characteristic "Brother Jona-
than" face, which is generally attributed to influences of climate,
soil, food, &c., Dr. Wilson is inclined to attribute to a decided
admixture of Indian blood; probably both causes have had to
do with it. Dr. Wilson rightly advocates the most judicious and
humane treatment of the Indians both by the U.S. and Canadian
Governments.

reeds and marsh-grass, exposing the water to the direct rays of
the sun, thereby promoting evaporation, so that by midsummer
even the mud in their basins has dried to a hard crust, and a
change in the temperature during the heated term brings, as a
rule, a cool, dry atmosphere instead of rain, as in former years.
Mr. Sawyer goes on to describe the large increase in the con-
sumption of water by domestic animals. In this State at the
present time there are at least "three million horses, cattle, and
mules, and five million hogs and sheep, and they will consume
not less than seventy million gallons of water every twenty-four

A correspondent of the Aberyshvilh Observer, the Rev.
James Lewis, of Llanilar Vicarage, writes as follows to that
journal:—" Whilst returning from service at the parish church of
Rhostie, about 8.15 r.M. on Friday, the 24th ult., in company

ground as when one walks in snow. When we got into the
adjoining field the light disappeared until we came near to the
end of it, when it was observed that our footsteps were again
marked by the same luminous appearance. In colour the light
was similar to that of phosphorus rubbed on a wall in a dark
room, or a mass of glow-worms, of which insect, however, there
was no trace on the surrounding ground."
In the Bullilin International of the Paris Observatory for the
21st inst. appears an interesting note by M. de Lagrene on the
thunderstorms which have occurred in the department of Haute-
Marne during the seven years ending 1874. In this department
the average annual number of thunderstorms is 87, of which 25
occur in July, 20 in May, and 14 in June. During the six
months from October to March inclusive the menn annual aggre-
gate is only six. The geographical position of Haute-Marne is
an important one as regards these electrical phenomena, about
which so very little is yet known, and this Departmental Meteo-
rological Commission is doing good service in contributing its
share in the work of collecting data on the origination, intensity,
and rate of propagation of thunderstorms, and the manner in
which they are influenced by the winds prevailing at the time, by
the contour of the ground, and by forests.

of rain observations set on foot by him, as explained in a recent
notice in Nature, is only the beginning of a more complete
system by which it is hoped that the whole meteorology of this
important State will be adequately and systematically observed
and turned to practical account in the interests of the people.
There is an idea shadowed out in the prospectus by which, if
gone into and developed, the United States will be divided into
meteorological districts or regions similar to what is now being
done in France, and which is really the only means by which
many highly important questions can be properly investigated.
Dr. Hinrichs gives the monthly rainfall for the months of past
years' observations, as well as the monthly means, at six places
in the State, and sends a carefully compiled monthly report of
his own observations made at the laboratory of the Iowa State
University at Iowa City, the amounts and averages of each
month being compared with the results of previous years'
observations.

On being circuited through 3,500 ohms for 23 min., the,E.M.F.
rose to 1 '383.
More observations were made than those here recorded,
readings being taken in some cases every minute, but the only
irregularity observed was that noticed when working through
30 ohms.
In these experiments we may notice that when the battery was
short circuited through 10 ohms, the E.M.F. after the first two
minutes fell 4J percent, in ij hours; through 20 ohms it fell
3 per cent.; and through 30 ohms, 2J per cent., in the same time.
But when circuited through too ohms and upwards, theE.M.F. in-
creased with the time, * the percentage increment increasing with
the resistance. Hence it appears not unlikely that there may be
some resistance through which the E.M.F. will remain absolutely
constant; should this be found to be the case, and should this
resistance always remain the same, the battery will be very
valuable when required to work through such a circuit.
It may be remarked that, in accordance with the usual rule,
the E.M.F. of the battery increases with the external resistance.

Exotic Timber-trees in Mauritius.—Amongst useful
plants that have been introduced into countries distant from their
native habitats, the timber-trees are of some interest, inasmuch
as beyond the proof of their establishment in foreign climates
and soils, some time is neeued to prove what effects the change
may have on the quality of the timber itself, for on this alone
depends the value of the experiment in a commercial point of
view. It is, however, satisfactory to learn that some well-
known timber-trees that have been introduced into Mauritius
through the instrumentality of the Royal Gardens, Kew, are in
a flourishing state. Thus, the mahogany (Swictenia mahagoni),
one of the oldest and most valued of furniture woods, has made
a very rapid growth, lorming, in three or four years after the
sowing of the seeds, trees about twenty feet in height, with
stems from three to six inches in diameter. In India, likewise,
the mahogany thrives well, and as a proof that the wood is
valuable, it may be stated that a tree blown down in the Cal-
cutta Botanic Gardens during the great cyclone realised over
1,000 rupees. Logwood (Hamatoxylon camptachianum) is re-
ported also to grow well in Mauritius, and it moreover makes
excellent hedges, far superior, it is said, to hawthorn. It has
been quite naturalised on the hills and waste lands in the vicinity
of Port Louis, and annually produces large quantities of seeds.

Bamboo as a Paper Material.—A good deal of attention
has of late years been directed to new materials for paper
making. Esparto has been one of the most successful of modern
discoveries, and now we are told that the supplies of that useful
substance are decreasing and must in course of time fail alto-
gether. Where then shall we look for our future supplies is a
question that has agitated many minds, and which has been
answered frequently by reierences to the numerous fibre-producing
plants of both the East and West Indies, Australia, &c. We know
that in India the fibrous barks of many trees, and notably that of
Daphnepapyracta, are used for paper making; while in China and
Japan, where paper is used for a much greater variety of purposes
than it is in England, the barks of Broussoneiiapapyriftra and B.
Kampferi are made into paper of every conceivable and indeed
inconceivable form ; for some specimens are so much like leather
that it takes a critical eye to detect it, and others are such good
imitations of crape and muslin that the same care is needed to de-
termine their true nature. That the Chinese and Japanese excel
in paper-making cannot be doubted, when we consider all their
manufactures, and more especially that fine quality of paper known
as India proof paper, which they make from young bamboos.

with oil, and least with alcohol. It is greater the higher the
specific gravity of the liquid. The change of pitch with alcohol
and with oil was more regular than with water, and the regu-
larity was almost perfect, if the changes of tone of the saturated
bars were compared with one another, and not with the dry
state.—Herren Kundt and Warburg continue the account of their
researches on friction and conduction of heat in rarefied gases.
Having experimented with air, hydrogen, and carbonic acid,
they here show that the coefficients of friction are independent of
pressure within the limits 750 mm. and 1 mm. mercury. With
rarefaction under 1 mm. they could not sufficiently remove the
vapour.—Dr. Oberbeck describes a method of determining the
conductivity of liquids for electricity. The principle is briefly
this :—Connect the ends of an induction spiral with a spark micro-
meter. Then, with a certain strength of inducing current, a
separation of the balls may be found, at which sparks con-
tinuously pass; but on slightly increasing the interval they cease
to pass. Next, connect the two ends of the spiral also with an
uninterrupted branch line; it will depend on the resistance of
this and the intensity of the inducing current, whether sparks

will pass between the balls. If the line is short and of metallic
wire, the spark current disappears, however near together the
balls may be brought; but if it consist of thin tubes of badly
conducting liquids,, a small approximation of the balls will
reproduce the sparks. Thus the conductivity of liquids may be
compared.—An improved construction of lightning conductors
for telegraph-wires is described by M. Schaack. The line-wire
and that of the telegraph-apparatus are connected respectively
with two binding screws on pieces of wood which form opposite
rims of a rectangular tin case containing water, and a loose coil
of German silver wire, covered with caoutchouc, connects the
binding screws through the water. The wire of the telegraph-
apparatus, after passing through the apparatus, returns to the case,
which is connected to earth.—There is also an account of M. Le
Cour's valuable proposal for employment of tuning-forks in elec-
tric telegraphy.—M. Schneebeli continues his researches on the
attraction and separation-time of electro-magnets, and takes occa-
sion to describe Hipp's chronograph as recently improved.—

Chinese as inhabiting the western portion of the central plain of
Asia two or three centuries before our era, and as having green

red-haired individuals among the nomad Turkomans of Asia
Minor, and Desmoulins believes that they are typical represen-
tatives of the primitive Turks.—In the same number of the
Bulletin we have a summary of the views entertained by M. A.
de Bertrand and others in regard to the definition and classifi-
cation of prehistoric eras. M. de Bertrand, in considering the
age of the Reindeer of Thurigen, suggests that we may refer the
period of the introduction of polished stone into Gaul to about
3,400 years before the Christian era, and that we may possibly
assume 2,000 years as the maximum of the duration of this age.
His attempted determination of these periods was strongly
opposed by MM. Leguay, Roujon, and others.—Several inte-
resting reports have been laid before the Paris Society, of
the numerous caves and grottoes which have been examined

been especially rich, while the explorations made at the cemetery
of Curanda (Aisne) are valuable from the great variety of objects
intermingled with the human remains, but owing to the succes-

later populations, the results yield no certain evidence of the
antiquity of the earlier races, whose remains are interspersed
among those of definite and determinable historical character.

Millescamps to the important conclusion that flint instruments

purpose. He considers that, of all the substances tried, bullet-
lead, although not perfectly free from sources of error, is the
most reliable, the results yielded by repeated experiments vary-
ing not more than five cubic centimetres for the same skull. No
absolutely correct method has as yet been devised, and hence
we must content ourselves for the present with approximate
results.

quantity of chromium. Since that time the mineral had been
analysed by Prof. Genth, of Philadelphia, who had discovered
that it contained a large quantity of vanadium, more than 20 per
cent. Under these circumstances he proposed to name the
mineral Roscoelite, as Prof. Roscoe, of Manchester, had so suc-
cessfully investigated the properties of vanadium. The mineral

the Sierra. It is associated with a small vein of quartz, but it is
principally in the mica that the gold is found, a few pounds of
the mineral (a miner's panful) often yielding as much as §240 in
gold. The occurrence of so large a quantity of a pentivalent
metalloid in a mica offers another and perhaps the most striking
anomaly presented by this class of minerals as regards their
chemical composition. Dr. Blake then alluded to some physio-
logical experiments he had performed to determine the molecular
relations of beryllium. Neither the specific heat of the metal
nor the vapour density of its chloride had been determined, and
chemists were undecided as to whether it was a bivalent or
quadrivalent element. Its physiological reactions, when intro-
duced directly into the blood of living animals, so closely
resembled those of alumina that there can be no doubt but that
it belongs to the same isomorphous group, and that it is a quad-
rivalent element. There is also a close relation between the
intensity of physiological action of this substance and its atomic
weight. When compared with aluminum, as in a series of
experiments conducted expressly to determine this point, the
quantities of Be203, under the form of sulphate, required to kill
2,270 grammes of rabbit, when injected into the veins in divided
doses (three injections), were '059, '061, "050; the quantities of
A1203, introduced into the veins under the same conditions were
•021, '023, "022 ; and the smallest quantity required to kill,
when introduced in one injection, was, of AI203, "016, and of

Be203, '038, showing a marked increase in the physiological
action of these substances, with an increase in the atomic weights,
the atomic weight of Al being 27-4 and of Be, 14. This, the author
believes, is the first occasion on which physiological reactions have
been us;d to determine the chemical properties of a substance.
Should, however, the carbon compounds follow the same laws in
their physiological reactions as the inorganic elements, living
matter must offer a valuable reagent in investigating their
molecular properties. The interesting experiments of Messrs.
McKendrick and Dewar, published in the 23rd vol. of the Pro-
ceedings of the Royal Society, would indicate that such may be
the case, as these gentlemen found in experimenting with the
compounds ot the Chinolin and Pyridin groups, that the phy-
siological actions became stronger in going from the lower to the
higher members of the series. They also observed that in the
Pyridin group, when the base became doubled by condensation,
not only was the physiological action more intense, but its cha-
racter was completely altered, agreeing in these respects with the
salts of iron with which analogous changes take place, both in
tlie character and intensity of their physiological action, when
the molecule is doubled in the change from ferrous to ferric salts,
