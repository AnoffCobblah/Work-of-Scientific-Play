THURSDAY, MAY 4,
TONNAGE LEGISLATION
W THEN it was announced, towards the close of the
vv year 1880, that a Royal Commission had been appointed to consider the operation of the Tonnage Law,
the action taken by the Government occasioned no
surprise amongst persons interested in shipping. Dis-
putes and differences of opinion, between the officials of
the Board of Trade on the one side, and shipbuilders or
shipowners on the other, had been growing more and
more frequent in recent years; the rapid development of
shipbuilding and the introduction of new types of ships
or new systems of construction making difficult the appli-
cation of the Law of 1854. When that Law was passed
its language was clear and unmistakable, strictly applying
to the ships then built. Wood still held the first place as
the material for construction, and the technical terms
used by Moorsom bore special reference to wood ships,
although they were not inapplicable to the existing iron
ships. Ships were then of moderate size and simple con-
struction; ocean steam-navigation was comparatively in
its infancy; and the marvellous growth in dimensions,

the last quarter of a century could not have been foreseen
much less provided for in framing the Tonnage Law.
It will readily be seen, therefore, that controversies of
opinion were unavoidable when the Act of 1854 had to be
extended to modern steamships, every clause being sub-
iected to the closest scrutiny, and a strict legal interpre-
tation being given to phrases which were originally clear
enough, but of which the modern readings were doubtful
or obscure. Shipowners naturally desired to secure the
minimum nominal tonnage for their ships, since dues and
taxes were assessed thereon; the Board of Trade sur-
veyors, on the other hand, while acting with perfect fair-
ness, might be expected to adopt an interpretation of the
law which tended towards a tonnage exceeding that
admitted by the owner. In some notable instances of
recent occurrence the Board of Trade has either had to
yield to these claims for reduced tonnage-measurement,
or has been b aten in an appeal to the Law Courts; and

it was natural, under these circumstances, that an attempt
should be made to secure such an amendment of the Act
of 1854 as was needed to prevent further controversy.
Nor was this the only reason for revision. Ever since
the present tonnage law has been in force for British

ships there has been a tendency on the part of other
maritime nations to approximate to our system of mea-
surement. The International arrangements made in
connection with the Danube navigation and the Suez
Canal have been based on the Moorsom system; and at
the present time there is a closer approach to a uniform
system of tonnage than has ever been reached before.
This desirable result has been produced to a large extent
by the action of the Board of Trade, whose successive
Acts for the Amendment of the Law of 1854 have been
adopted in foreign countries, although they have failed to
secure Parliamentary approval at home. Consequently
we stand, at present, in the curious position of still having
in force the earliest and confessedly imperfect edition of
the Moorsom system, whereas English experience and
suggestion have given to other countries amended editions.
On this ground, therefore, it was desirable to revise the
tonnage law, even if the system remained unchanged in
principle.
Further reasons for revision of a more thorough and
sweeping kind were not wanting. It was admitted that

freedom allowed them in illustrating their views. If no
other purpose had been served, the inquiry would have
been justified by the very valuable summary of facts and
opinions which it has been the means of putting on
record. All that it is necessary to read for the full under-
standing of the past history of British tonnage laws can
be found in the Minutes of Evidence or the Appendices;
and much valuable information respecting foreign tonnage
laws can also be found therein. Valuable as this feature
of the work may be, however, it does not represent the
purpose for which the Commission was primarily ap-
pointed, and when one turns to that aspect of the subject
the results are not nearly so satisfactory.
In Nature, vol. xxv. pp. 585-7, it was stated that the
Commission did not make a unanimous Report. Three
of its members dissented from the majority, and each of
them produced a separate Report. This is not a matter
for surprise ; in fact it would not have been surprising
had the Commission simply followed the precedent of the
Parliamentary Committee of 1874, and submitted the
evidence without making a Report. The majority con-
sisted of nine gentlemen whose opinions are entitled to

the greatest respect, including shipowners, shipbuilders,
dock-proprietors, and representatives of the Board of
Trade. As explained in vol. xxv. pp. 585-7, they recom-
mend the retention of the principle of the existing law
viz. measurement of internal capacitybut propose certain
amendments in detail. Some of these amendments are
reasonable enough, but others are of questionable cha-
racter; it is, however, of greater importance for our
present purpose to consider whether the arguments
advanced against a change in the principle of measure-
ment are sufficiently weighty to prevent any change. Of
all these arguments the most important are those relating
to international obligation and convenience. Bearing in
mind what was said above respecting the action of this
country in leading up to a system of international tonnage,
on the basis of internal measurement, it will be seen that
an abandonment of that basis ought not to be lightly
undertaken. But this fact need not bar the inquiry as to
the advantages to be gained by such a change; for
obviously the most thorough and exhaustive investigation
would be needed, on other grounds, before the change
could be made. And if after due investigation British
shipowners were convinced that the change was desirable,
the evidence which would convince them could scarcely
fail to induce foreign maritime nations to follow our lead.

The matter might well form the subject of an Interna-
tional Conference before final action was taken; much as
was done in 1873 when the Suez Canal Regulations were
framed.
Turning to the other side much more forcible argu-
ments can be urged against a continuance of the present
system. Moorsom took great pains to explain his reasons
for using internal capacity as the basis of tonnage mea-
surement; these may be summed up in the statement
that internal capacity was the fairest measure of the pos-
sible earnings of most ships. This was probably the case
in 1854 ; but is no longer true. In most ships the limit
of freight-earning is now found in their "dead-weight
capability "; that is to say, the prevalent cargoes of com-
merce do not now fill the whole space, when the weight
taken on board has reached the limit of draught which
can be accepted with a due regard to the safety of the
ships. This is not true of all ships, but of mo;t. Pas-
senger ships, for instance, do not come under this con-
dition; in them space is of the greatest value. Other

feeling of shipowners on the subject of establishing such
a central authority. If it should be formed, then the load-
line question might be dealt with more satisfactorily than
it has been hitherto, and one difficulty in dead-weight
measurement would disappear. But others, and probably
fatal ones, would remain ; more particularly in dealing
with passenger steamers or vessels built to carry light
cargoes. In such cases Mr. Waymouth proposes to fix,
for tonnage purposes only, a deep load-line; this is not
merely objectionable, but would probably be impracti-
cable in many vessels. The dead-weight system has
much to recommend it for consideration on the grounds
of simplicity and exactness, as well as freedom from the
difficulties incidental to internal measurement. But it is
not likely to come into use.
Mr. Waymouth, it will be noted, agrees with the
majority in proposing to continue the immemorial practice
of basing tonnage measurement upon earnings or earning-
power. This principle, although long accepted, has
always been held open to question, on the ground that
the accommodation provided for a ship in harbours,
docks, canals, &c, should regulate the dues paid by her,

and not her earnings. The "service rendered," and not
the earnings, does appear the fairest basis of assessment,
and has a considerable weight of authority to support it;
but to adopt this basis would clearly necessitate a settle-
ment of the mode of appraising service rendered. Mr.
Rothery proposes to take the displacement, or volume of
water displaced by a ship to a fixed load-line, as the
measure of this service. The load-line, he suggests,
might be fixed by the owner or some central authority-
To this proposal many objections have been raised; but
that which seems to have most force is found in the state-
ment that the volume of water displaced does not measure
the accommodation required, since various degress of
fineness of form under water might be associated with
the same extreme dimensionslength, breadth, and
draught. Two ships agreeing in these dimensions and
requiring practically the same accommodation might
differ in displacement by as much as 50 to 60 per cent, of
the smaller.
Mr. Rothery's proposal has, however, done good in
recalling attention to the principle of taxation on service
rendered. In further investigations this is not likely to
be overlooked; and it must be possible to frame some
scheme which is not open to the objection to displace-
ment above mentioned. The proposal to take the pro-

duct of the three extreme dimensions of a ship as a basis
for tonnage has been considered, and has much to recom-
mend it, if associated with a fixed load-line. It cannot
be said that any of these alternative schemes have
received the full consideration they require before being
brought forward for adoption. The investigation would
necessarily be laborious, and the issues dependent upon
it are so important that it should be intrusted only to
competent and impartial hands. Certain conclusions are
necessarily forced upon every person who makes a study
of this subject. First, it is impossible in any revision of
tonnage law to ignore the question of the load-line legis-
lation. The majority of the Commission, in their final
Report, propose to keep the two questions distinct; but
it has been stated publicly by Mr. Waymouth that up to
the very last draft Report, the majority made recom-
mendations in the opposite direction; and if this is the
case the less weight attaches to the recommendation
which actually appears. Second: in considering future
legislation, both for tonnage and for load-line, greater
regard must be had to the provision of stability for mer-

and abnormal sources of my th, but he comes to the ultimate
conclusion that they all depend on man's peculiar and
spontaneous tendency to animate all things, whence his
general principle has taken the name of animism
But, while assenting to this general principle, which re-
mains as the sole ultimate source of all mythical repre-
sentation, I repeat the usual inquiry; what causes man
to animate all the objects which surrounds him, and what
is the cause of this established and universal fact?''
And elsewhere the author states this problem thus :
"To attain our object, it is necessary that the direct
personification of natural phenomena, as well as the in-
direct personification of metaphor; the infusion of life
into man's own shadow, into reflex images and dreams;
the belief in the reality of normal illusions, as well as of
the abnormal hallucinations of delirium, of madness, and
of all forms of nervous affections ; all these things must
be resolved into a single generating act which explains
and includes them."
Such being the problem with which the work is mainly
concerned, its solution is attempted by the following
theory :Assuming the fundamental identity of human
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
and brute psychology, it is argued a priori that, seeing
the tendency to personify inanimate objects is so universal
among primitive men, we might expect to find a similar
tendency in animals, and this, according to the author,
we do find :
"Animals are accustomed to show such indifference
towards numerous objects, that it might be supposed that
they have an accurate conception of what is inanimate;
but this arises from habit, from long experience, and
partly also from the hereditary disposition of the organism
towards this habit. But if the object should act in any-
unusual way, then the animating process which, as we
have just said, was rendered static by its habitual exer-
cise, again becomes dynamic, and the special and perma-
nent character of the act is at once revealed."
And he proceeds to describe many experiments of his
own, in frightening or surprising animals by making
inanimate objects perform unusual movements. From
these considerations and experiments he concludes that
every object of perception is " implicity assumed" by an
animal to be "a living, conscious, and acting subject;"
that the animal transfuses into all things, "in proportion
to the effects which result from them, his own nature, and
modifies them in accordance with intrinsic form of his
consciousness, his emotions, and his instincts."
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
This being taken as true of animals, the theory pro-
ceeds to the consideration that if we superimpose on the
animal faculties of sensation and perception, the dis-
tinctively human faculties of reflection and symbolic
thought, we should obtain a full explanation of the
psychology of myth-formation.
We have said that this theory is to some extent novel,
and it will now be seen that the extent to which it is so
consists in its relegating to the domain of animal psy-
chology that tendency to animism which has already been
recognised as the feature in human psychology which is
largely concerned in the formation of myth. But even
thus far the theory is not wholly novel, for Comte sup-
posed that animals possessed some crude ideas of
fetishism, and Spencer, in his " Principles of Sociology,"
says :
"Holding, as I have given reasons for doing, that
fetishism is not original but derived, I cannot, of course
coincide in this view; nevertheless I think the behaviour
cf intelligent animals elucidates the genesis of it;"

A PRIMER OF ART
A Primer of Art. By John Collier. (London: Mac-
millan and Co., 1882.)
IN this admirable little work Mr. Collier has succeeded
in bringing clearly into view the helpful relation in
which science may stand to the Arts of Designsculpture,
drawing, and pre eminently painting. The aim of the
primer is to give the outlines of such knowledge of the
artistic field of vision, of the visual powers, and of the
means of delineation, as may best aid the student to
acquire that power of strict imitation of natural objects
which is the artist's first qualification.
The notion hitherto prevailing and perhaps somewhat
superciliously held to on the part of artthat because
the primary functions of science and of art respectively
are widely different, therefore no legitimate help can be
rendered by one to the otheris practically discredited
in every page of Mr. Collier's little work. Throughout,
his object is to pioneer the student to an artistic goal;
throughout, the means employed have all the security of
clear scientific principle. The theory of the Primer is
that by knowing with scientific accuracy how some things
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
are, the task of exhibiting artistically how other things
appear may be greatly simplified.
After devoting a few charming pages to the latest sup-
positions concerning the origin of sculpture and drawing
pages illustrated by specimens of prehistoric and even
palaeolithic artMr. Collier quits "debateable ground"
for that on which surer scientific light can be shed for the
guidance of the student in the practice of art.
And here nothing is overlooked. Boundaries, Light
and Shade, Texture, Perspective, Colour, and Contrast
are the headings of so many terse and luminous little
chapters, through each of which conies some word to the
learner from the invisible world where science works,
warning him how, unless he gives heed to certain hidden
actualities within and without him, he may and probably
will go many times wrong before he lights on the best
way of rendering the natural objects before him.
Accurate seeing is necessary to ensure accurate delinea-
tion. The facts of simple appearance are what the art
student needs to lay hold of. Science, whose constant
business is with facts of every order, aids him here with
suggestions how to discriminate between sight and infer-
encebetween that actual aspect of an object which is
due to its present relation to the sight of the observer,
and that compound mental view of it which is due to the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
mixed memory of many previous aspect?. A perusal of
Mr. Collier's pages on the nature of perspective, on the
undulatory theory of light, on the action of a lens, on the
structure and nervous mechanism of the eye, and on the
physiological rationale of the phenomena of colour show
how much scientific information can be given without the
use of a single technical phrase.
Having learnt to see, the art student must further learn
to delineate. Here again, in discussing the painter's
media, it is still with the authority of science the teacher
speaks. The chapter on " Turbid Media" clears up the
difficulty respecting the varying behaviour of pigments as
used on different "grounds.'' Here, too, as elsewhere,
each practical suggestion is accompanied by a scientific
reason why the means advocated should be adopted, such
reason being always backed by some absolutely lucid
explanation of the nature of the difficulty to be sur-
mounted, or of the effect to be aimed at.
With the subject of landscape painting comes up the
question of aerial perspective ; and thereupon follow some
admirable pages on the constitution of the atmosphere

reprint of a lecture course, and may be fairly said to fulfil
well the object proposed in the preface. Great pains has
evidently been taken to obtain data of actual examples of
important works within the above scope; the series of
twenty-one well-executed large plates of these is a most
valuable feature of the work. The get-up of the work,
being issued from the Clarendon Press, is of course excel-
lent; the number of folds in the plates is an inconvenience
(few have less than six, and one has ten folds), which
might have been obviated by placing fewer diagrams on
each plate. A very useful feature is the addition at the
end of each chapter of a short summary of its matter,
with many good practical remarks.
The work opens with a chapter on the physics of the
subject, followed by one on discharge-measurement, then
by one on general principles. Then come seven chapters
on various appliances and details, viz., dredgers, piling,
foundations, locks, inclines, lifts, fixed and movable
weirs, dams, and movable bridges. Then follow one
chapter on inland canals, one on great ship canals, one
on protection from floods, four on improvement of tidal
rivers, and lastly, one on the improvement of the mouths

of tideless rivers.
From the great variety of subjects treated of in a com-
pass of 322 pages, the treatment is sometimes unequal.
The descriptions of the newest forms of the various
appliances are, together with their illustrative plates, very
interesting and instructive. But perhaps the most valu-
able part of the whole work is the last five chapters on the
difficult and important subject of the improvement of
river mouths; the few guiding principles that can be said
to be known about so obscure a question are well brought
out from the study of grand examples. The subject of
discharge-measurement is not adequately treated: a
reference to the recently-published (1881) "Roorkee
Hydraulic Experiments" would probably have materially
influenced this chapter in giving less importance to
current-meters, and more to floats (especially tube-rods),
and in the entire rejection of the old Chezy formula,
V= Cx */JiS, with a constant value of C. The chapter
on inland canals is also (perhaps unavoidably) sketchy:
thus the description of Indian canals covers only two
pages, many of them being simply named.

Vivisection
The editor of Nature has r,o room for proofs; I must,
the efore, confine myself to statements of facts which "A Student
of Medicine " can verify by consulting the ' ooks I shall name.
Prof. Schiff is the author of several works detailing an enor-
mous number of vivisections. Some six years ago the "Gazetta
d'kalia" calculated that, of dogs alone, he had used in his
laboratory 14,000supplied to him gratuitously by the munici-
pality of Florencebesides great numbers of other animals
otherwise procured. Afterwards he received only about eight
dogs a week from the police, and, in consequence, posted up an
advertisement offering a franc for every dog brought to him,
and a bonus upon ten dogs brought by one person. In the
"Physiologic de la Digestion" he says: "I am forced to cut
the vocal cords of the greater number of my do^s, lest their
nightly howlings should compromise my physiological pursuits."
In Prof. Schiffs "Lezioni di Fisiologia Sperimentale" will
be found ample justification of my statements with regard to the
character of the vivisections performed by him. I regret much
that there is no room to quote examples here. It will be ob-
served by the reader of the e "Lessons of experimental physio-
logy," that the nature and duration of the majority of the experi-

ments render the administration of chloroform either impossible,
or at the best, utterly inadequate to hinder suffering. The
animal is either distinctly sensible throughout the experiment, or
has been already operated on some days previou-ly, being pre-
served in a mangled and paralysed condition for further experi-
ment.
As regards the "anesthesia," I have to-day questioned a
medical graduate, who resided seven years in Florence while
Prof. Schiff lived there, and was constantly in his laboratory.
He says that, although chloroform was commonly administered
on tying down the animals (he believes, for the convenience of
the operator), no pretence was made of keeping them under the
influence of the antithetic after the preliminary incision, and
thatas in fact is conclusively proved in Prof. Schiff's own
worksmutilated animals were reserved from day to day, and
from week to week, for further investigation.
If since leaving Florence and publishing his "Lessons" Prof.
Schiff has mended his ways, I am sincerely glad to hear it. Should
such, indeed, prove to be the case, public opinion at Florence
which ran high against him and his doingsmust be credited
with some share in the reformation.
In conclusion, let me say in regard to the di-courteous charges
of "error," "ignorance," and disregard of "facts" so freely
brought against me by your correspondent, that if in this case
any person is amenable to them, it is certainly not one who, being

works of Prof. Schiff, she must know that there exists a small
book in which he has explained in detail his methods of vivisec-
tion, &c. The title is: "Sofia il metodo seguito negli esperi-
menti sugli animali viventi nel laoratorio di fisiologia di
Hrenze." It first appeared in 1864; the second enlarged edi-
tion bears the date 1874. The book is written in a popular style,
so as to render it easy even for the uninitiated to understand
what vivisection is, and how it is practised by Prof. Schiff; it
should be read by every per on desirous of forming an unbiased
judgment on the subject.
2. My letter was a reply to the accusation brought against
Trof. Schiff of perpetrating "horrible tortures," "atrocities,"

NATURE
When a somewhat weak current is passing between the knobs
of a Becker-Voss electro-induction machine, its passage can be
altogether stopped by simply blowing across the path of the
current. The handle is turned in vain; and even when the
blowing has ceased, i short time is required before the current is
able to pursue its old path. When the instrument has been
warmed, and the current becomes stronger, the blowing, although
now unable to stop the current altogether, drives it into irregu-
larly curved paths, which are determined by the force exerted.
I do not remember to have seen the experiment mentioned in
any book. It is as curious as it is simple.
We now see why the air requires to be at rest for the weak
current to force a passage through it, and to keep that passage
open for the succeeding sparks to follow; while the stronger
current leaps from point to point, as though in pursuit of the
warmed and opened passage which has been driven by the wind
out of its former position. Henry Bedford

come from the middle and northern parts of North Ame-
rica, the meteorology of that country has been invested
with a peculiar and increasing interest for the inhabitants
of Western Europe, and though, according to Hoffmeyer,
the chance that a depression in the United States will
subsequently cause a storm somewhere in our own islands
is only one in four, it is a ratio quite substantial enough
to make us regard with attention warnings such as those
transmitted to us through the medium of the New York
Herald.
While America is thus from her enormous size and
westerly position enabled to act the part of our weather
prophetess, she bids fair in addition to leave us far behind
in the more theoretical branches of weather-science, and
though to admit this may be somewhat wounding to
our national amour propre, it is nevertheless an idea
which is openly entertained by some of our leading meteoro-
logists. For our comfort it may be reasonably ascribed,
in part at least, to our small size and unfavourable geo-
graphical position having afforded but little encourage-
ment to really able men to devote their attention to a
science whose operations are conducted on a scale com-
pared with which our area of observation is indeed
microscopic, so that until within quite recent times the
succession of fair and foul weather in these islands was
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
regarded merely as a series of irregular, eccentric, and
totally unpredictable changes. The work before us,
entitled "Methods and Results," by Prof. William
Ferrel, of the American Coast Survey, and prepared
for the u':e of the coast pilot, forms the second part of a
series of meteorological researches undertaken by the
author, which comprise an elaborate theoretical investiga-
tion into the general and local mechanics of the atmo-
sphere. In Part I., which appeared in 1877, the general
motions of the atmosphere are more particularly dealt
with, and conclusions are arrived at which have appeared
in part in the Mathematical Monthly for i860 and the
American Journal for November, 1874.2
In both these publications the author lays great stress
upon the important part played by the deflecting force
to the right of its path, to which a current of air is sub-
jected by virtue of the earth's rotation in whatever direc-
tion it may be blowing. This deflecting force is measured
by the acceleration 2 n cos i/r, where n represents the
angular velocity of terrestrial rotation, and 1^ is the co-
latitude (see Nature, vol. v. p. 384).

tendenciesgyration and inflow, or outflow according as
the air is in the interior or exterior partthe air near
the surface takes a middle course, and flows spirally
around and toward the centre from the zone of maximum
pressure on the one side, and on the other in a contrary
spiral outwards from the centre to the outer limit of the
anticyclone.
It is important to observe that the author explains the
accumulation of air with its maximum at the dividing
line between the interior and exterior districts (cyclone
and anticyclone, as they are termed elsewhere throughout
this work) as "due at the start mostly to the gyrations in
the upper part of the atmosphere,'' which, being less influ-
enced by friction, are in consequence more circular than
those below; the pressure from this accumulation tending
to force the air near the earth's surface out from beneath
it on the one side toward the centre of the cyclone, and on
the other toward the outer limit of the anticyclone.
The difference of pressures or gradient between the
regions of high and low pressure in a cyclone, is thus
shown to be, not so much the cause of the wind, as the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
mechanical result of the deflecting force of the earth's
rotation and the centrifugal force engendered by the
gyrations.
It should, however, be borne in mind, that the forces just
mentioned, are by no means to be regarded as causing the
cyclone in the sense of being independent sources of
energy. They can only arise in consequence of some
initial motion of the air, which must itself be due to a
small difference of pressure, and unless such primary dis-
turbing cause be continu illy maintained by external
influences, the entire system of motion will shortly come
to rest.
The preceding view of cyclone generation has already
made some way since Ferrel first enunciated its leading
characteristics in his previous writings. It lies midway
between what is sometimes called the in-blowing or
ascension-current theory of Reye and Espy, which regards
the central depression as the main cause of the wind, and
ihad held by Thorn, Meldrum, Willson, and Loomis,
according to which the central depression is mainly due to
the centrifugal force generated by two pre-existing currents
passing one another in opposite directions. A third theory,
held by Blanford and Eliot, and evolved chiefly from a
study of the cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, makes the
condensation of vapour the primary cause of disturbance,

but allows the greater part of the subsequent depression
of the barometer to be due to the causes adduced by
Ferrel. This latter theory, in fact, only differs from that
put forward by the author in the part pla>ed by condensa-
tion of vapour in giving rise to the initial motion of the air,
which Ferrel considers to be considerably less than that
exercised by a difference of temperature. Among the
conclusions arrived at by the author, and which are gene-
rally confirmed by the results of observation, may be
noticed the following; but these, it must be remarked, are
only strictly true for a regular, symmetrical, and stationary
cyclone:
(a) "The wind inclines towards the centre from the
direction of the tangent, and the amount of inclination is
nearly in proportion to the friction (mainly of the air
against the earth's surface)."
(b) "The inclination diminishes with the altitude, and
therefore at some distance from the earth's surface the
gyrations are more circular than near it"
(f) "Toward the centre of a cyclone, where the gyratory
velocity is greater, the inclination is less, and therefore

works and in the Zeitschrift fiir Meteorologte (Band x.),
we need not notice it here except to point out that,
assuming the correctness of the formula, the gradient,
cateris paribus, should vary (i) directly with the latitude,
(2) inversely with the distance from the centre, (3) in-
versely as the temperature, (4) directly with the amount
of inclination.
The foregoing results have all been obtained without
considering the term depending on temperature and
humidity, and which expresses the effect of the disturb-
ing force necessary to start and maintain the interchang-
ing motions between the interior and exterior portions of
the air over a given area. That such a disturbing function
is necessary, is evident both from preliminary considera-
tions, and also from the form of the general equations of
motion, since they would otherwise be satisfied by the
conditions for a state of test. The author enunciates this
principle in Part I. Chap. III. where he says : " There can
be no winds then without a disturbance of the static equili-
brium by means of a difference of temperature or of aqueous
vapour in different parts of the atmosphere." And it is
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
important to bear it in mind, if only because we are too
often apt to overlook it in the multitude of secondary
causes brought to light by a study of atmospheric me-
chanics. A consideration of this term, in which tem-
perature and humidity are treated jointly, and the former
is assumed to vary with the distance from the centre,
leads to the remarkable conclusion that there are two
species of cyclones, one with relatively warm centres, the
more common case, and the other with relatively cold
ones.
These cyclones differ specifically from each other
chiefly in the way in which the pressure is distributed
and the gyrations directed at different altitudes.
In a cyclone with a relatively warm centre the air at
the earth's surface moves in a cyclonic spiral round and
towards the centre, but as we ascend the gyratory velocity
diminishes with the altitude, and the annulus of high
pressure approaches the centre, until at a very high
elevation the highest pressure of that stratum might even
be at the centre, and the air gyrate anticyclonically from
it over the whole area at that level. In brief, the cyclonic
area becomes smaller, and the anticyclonic larger, as we
ascend.
In a cyclone with a cold centre the reverse occurs.
At the surface of the earth the initial tendency of the
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
air is to move outwards, and this may be so strong near
the surface that there may be only anticyclonic gyrations
at this level, with the maximum pressure of the lowest
stratum at the centre. As we ascend, however, the
gyrations round the centre become more and more
cyclonic, while the annulus of maximum pressure gra-
dually retreats further and further from it.
There is, besides, according to the theory, an ascending
motion of the air in the interior part of a warm-centred
cyclone, and a descending motion in the exterior part,
both generally small in comparison with the horizontal
motions toward and from the centre. In the case of a
cold-centred cyclone these motions are reversed.
Now as a barometer at the earth's surface records
simply the integrated effect of what happens in all the
strata up to the top of the atmosphere, this might
obviously vary in the same way for both kinds of cyclones,
and so tell us absolutely nothing of such remarkably di-
verse conditions prevailing at higher altitudes. The
behaviour of the air in the warm centred cyclone is what
we are accustomed to observe in the case of most cyclones,

violence of a storm arriving on our coasts, so that if
meteorology, or that branch of it termed weather fore-
casting, is ever to become an exact science, we must
endeavour to find out, by captive balloons or other-
wise, what can never be determined by registration
at the earth's surface alone, viz. the condition of the
atmosphere vertically as regards temperature and
humidity.
The author concludes his theoretical investigation into
the mechanics of cyclones by a discussion of the causes
of their motion over the earth's surface. He first of all
shows that every cyclone possesses an inherent force
lending to urge it towards the pole of the hemisphere in
which it has been formed. This follows immediately
from the fact that the deflecting force due to the earth's
rotation varies with the cosine of the colatitude, and is
therefore greater on the polar than on the equatorial
side of a cyclone, a residual poleward component of force
being thus brought to bear upon every portion of the
cyclone. In addition to this, a cyclone, as soon as it is
generated, must partake of the general motions of the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
atmosphere, which the author more especially deals with
in his "Meteorological Researches," Part I., to which
we have already made allusion; and since the general
motions of the atmosphere are there considered to form
two great cyclonic systems round the poles, all ordinary
cyclones are simply cyclones within a cyclone, so that
their general motion of translation is partly the result
of the actual motion of the air in these large and per-
petual, though perpetually changing, cyclones, and partly
that of their inherent tendency to press pole-wards.
For example, as the author says, " in the trade-wind
latitudes the wind at the earth's surface is westward . . .
and hence the cyclones in these latitudes are carried
westward, . . . and having a tendency towards the Pole,
the resultant of the two is a westward motion, inclined a
little towards the poles, or in the northern hemisphere a
motion about west-north-west. After having arrived at
the parallel of 300 or 35° in the tropical calm-belt, where
there is no westward motion, the progressive motion is a
Polar one mostly, but after progressing still nearer the
Pole, into the middle and higher latitudes, the general
eastward motion of the atmosphere here, which is great
in the upper regions, carries now the cyclone toward the
east, and the direction of the progressive motion, which is
usually about east-north-east, is the resultant of this east-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
ward motion and the motion round the Pole. All well-
developed cyclones, therefore, having their origin near the
equator, have mostly a progressive motion represented
by a curve somewhat in the form of a parabola, having
its vertex in the tropical calm belt at the parallel of 300
or 35°."
It is moreover shown that the general motions of the
atmosphere must not only cause the cyclone to travel
more or less with them, but also affect the inclination of
the wind to the isobars, decreasing it in the front, and
increasing it in the rear part.
With regard to further modifying causes, the author
favours the views of Clement Ley regarding the effect of
the distribution of aqueous vapour in determining the
direction in which a cyclone propagates itself.
He does not indeed attempt to explain how they some-
times wander off on an entirely unlooked-for course, or
else remain stationary for some considerable period;
otherwise he might claim to have at least attempted a
solution of the entire problem on which weather science
depends. Clement Ley himself, in his admirable little

pected character; and as through the courtesy of this

been placed in my hands, I am induced to reproduce

The discussion which took place at the late meeting of
the Astronomical Society, so far as my information
extends, substantiated strongly by independent evidence
the existence of these long, narrow streaks, some of them
even in positions where they have not been delineated
by Schiaparelli; but their duplication by similar and
parallel lines does not seem to have been elsewhere
noticed. Some difference of opinion may possibly be
expected concerning these strange appearances; and the
consequent enfeebling (to say the least of it) of the long-
admitted terrestrial analogy may be, to some minds,
unacceptable; but the established reputation of the
observer demands at any rate a respectful attention
to his statements. It may be preferable to suspend
a more detailed account till we receive a full elucida-
tion of the subject in the memoir, of which we possess
only a preliminary notice; for the present it may suffice
to mention that he found the atmosphere of Mars
apparently clearer than in 1877, and was thus enabled to
recover the markings then detected more satisfactorily
even than in 1879-So, and to confirm the general accuracy
of his two earlier charts; while the concise, but very clear

on one side since 1879 of the  Kaiser Sea  (his Syrtis

or islands towards the limbs, the confirmed existence of
oblique white streaks, the unfolding of minute labyrinthine
detail, andthe continuous development already mentioned,
day after day, of the collateral lines which double the so-
called " canals, and extend with them ordinarily along

produced from the results of earlier observers ; but, so far

afterwards becoming opac and degenerating into a yel-

ing the organs in which they are located]has been
shown to be an infectious malady communicable from
one human being to another, from man to animal, and
from animal to animal.
The successful experiments of inoculating with, feeding
on, and causing to inhale human tubercular matter, carried
out on the lower animals, such as guinea-pigs, rabbits, dogs,
pigs, &c, by Villemin, Dr. Wilson Fox, Mr. John Simon,

and Salomonsen, Tappeiner, and Baumgarten are con-
clusive in these respects. Similarly it has been shown
that the tuberculosis of cattle or Perlsucht is communi-
cable not only within the species but also to other animals.
Whether Perlsucht is also communicable to man, espe-
cially through meat and milk, as is maintained by some
observers (Semmer, Baumgarten, and others), is as yet
an open question, and, as must be obvious to every one,

species. What the cause of the malady is, has until now
been undetermined, although it has been at various times
surmised that, like other infectious diseases, it is of a
parasitic origin. Thus Schiiller, and especially Klebs,
have tried to prove that owing to the presence of micro-
cocci in the tubercular deposits, these micrococci were
the materies morbi. And indeed Klebs maintains to
have succeeded in cultivating outside the body of an
animal, i.e. artificially the "monas tuberculosum," as he
calls the said micrococcus, and to have again produced
the tubercular disease by inoculating animals with this
purified micrococcus. Klebs' observations and conclu-
sions have not been accepted as reliable, and it has been
reserved for Dr. Koch to discover the real cause of the
disease, in identifying it with a specific bacillus. In a
weighty paper, " The Etiology of Tuberculosis," published
in the Berlin Klin. Wochcnschr, 1882, No. 15, Dr. Koch
sets forth the whole course of his investigation, the
methods and experiments, all his observations and definite
conclusions on this question, and anyone who peruses
carefully this paper will come to the conclusion that
Koch's results are to be accepted with unconditional
faith, and I have no manner of doubt will be considered
by all pathologists as of the very highest importance.

especially that on the etiology of splenic fever or Anthrax,
and his observations on pathogenic Bacteria, this last
work of his, on the Etiology of Tuberculosis, will be an
additional and brilliant testimony to his ingenious and
successful method of research.
The first step in the inquiry was to ascertain whether
any definite form of microphyte is constantly present in
the tubercular deposits. This question could not be
solved by the ordinary methods of research, but with new
methods; it was decided in the affirmative. For the
demonstration of the presence of the specific bacillus¦
which Koch calls the tubercle-bacillusthe following
method proved successful: Tubercular deposit fresh, or
after hardening with reagents, is stained for twenty to
twenty-four hoursat a temperature of 40 Centigrades,
only half to one hour is requiredwith a half per cent,
solution of methylene blue, to which a small quantity of
a 10 per cent, solution of caustic potash is added. After
this, the tubercular material is stained for a minute or
two in a concentrated watery solution of vesuvin.and then

SOME PRIMITIVE IDEAS ON METEOROLOGY
T N an article published in Nature (vol. xxv. p. 82) on
*¦ the opinions of the Chinese Emperor Khang-hi on
certain natural phenomena, it will be remembered that
the yang and yin, or the male and female principles of
Chinese philosophy, played a conspicuous part. Japan,
it is well known, adopted at a very early period in its
history the law, polity, science, philosophy, and writing
of the Chinese, and with them the yang and yin; and it
may not be uninteresting to our readers to see how th:
doctrine of these dual forces, mutually repellent as well
as attractive, has been employed to explain the facts of
meteorology. A recent issue of the Japan Gazette news-
paper of Yokohama contains the translation of a work

irritation of the earth-air, which sometimes sends out
flames. It is said that a kind of beast accompanies the
thunder, and it moves about in the air. This is nothing
strange, because at a certain island called Ampon, which
is about 3900 ri (i ri = i\ miles) from Japan, there is a
bird called the Kasttbara, which is covered with fur
instead of feathers, and which eats fire. Other birds live
on wind. As this world is unlimitedly great and extensive
there may have lived strange beasts and birds, like the
thunder beast which the Japanese talk about. The volume
of sound given out by thunder depends on the number of
water-clouds in the air. When the latter is small, the sound
of the thunder is not loud and appears far off. On the
other hand when the clouds are piled up in the heavens,
the sound is loud and is simultaneous with the lightning.
The sound is caused by the passage of fire through the
water. The ancients regarded thunder as the report of
the battle between fire and waterthe male and female
elements. If this were the case there is no reason for the

extraordinary creatures that form the zoological mytho-

accompanied Capt. Carter on his journey with the three Indian
elephants in 1879, meant for the use of one of the Belgian
expeditions. In his paper Mr. Rankin gives full details of the
conduct of the elephants up to Mpwapwa, where their troubles
began. Although they were severely attacked by the Tsetse, no
permanent evil effect seems to have followed. At Mpwapwa,
indeed, a report was sent to the King of the Belgians, in which
it was stated that the elephant experiment was a complete
success, on account of their immunity against Tsetse, their ability
to live on the uncultivated food of the country, and to march
over all kinds of ground. A few days after the report, however,
the largest elephant suddenly died. Mr. Rankin attributed its
death to insufficient food and over-work. In India it had been
stall-fed ; in Africa it never seems to have had enough to
eatthe back-bones of all these stood six or seven inches from
their flanks at Mpwapu. It is clear also that their loads were
far beyond what they had been accustomed to. As is known,
the other elephants subsequently died. This experiment
cannot be considered a fair one, though the lessons it taught will
be of service in any future attempt to utilise the animal as a beast
of burden in Africa.

A hydromotor recently invented by Herr Fleischer of Kiel,
for propulsion and steering of vessels, acts (we learn from Wiede-
mann's Beiblatter, 3) by pressure of steam on water, in a cylinder,
forcing out the water as a jet below. A float on the water in the
cylinder works, in a simple way, the opening and closure of the
valves for admission and escape of the steam, and the vacuum
produced by condensation of steam in a condenser opens valves
for readmi-sion of water. The hot water layer, which forms on
the liquid surface, and the wooden lining of the cylinder, reduce
the condensation during expulsion of the water to a minimum.
A comparison of the working of the author's vessel with that of
the Water-witch and Rival (also propelled by hydraulic reaction)
showed that while the kinetic energy of the expelled water was
in the Water-witch 315 per cent, of the indicated quantity of

GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES
Lieut. Danenhauer and two of the crew of the ill-fated
Jeannettc have arrived at St. Petersburg, where they were met
with a hearty reception. Lieut. Danenhauer has little hope that
Capt. De Long and those wilh him can have survived, though
Engineer Melville is searching for them. He speaks of the un-
satisfactory nature of the charts of the Lena mouths and that
part of the Siberian coast, and states that Baron Nordenskjold
has added little to our knowledge in this respect. But the Baron
did not profess to do so, and indeed could not, seeing that his
aim was to get over the ground as quickly as possible. The
Lieutenant also is not sanguine as to the possibility of opening
up trade by the mouth of the Siberian rivers, forgetting
apparently that the time of his arrival at the Lena mouth was
pa»t the time most favourable for navigation, and the conditions
of his arrival were certainly unfortunate.
Writing on Chinese maps, the North China Herald says
that the present dynasty has made grea'er efforts at map-making

duce into them lines of latitude and longitude. The old maps
of China are very va^ue and inaccurate, and are not ancient in

any sense. Ssu-ma-Chien when compiling his history did not
judge it needful to illustrate it with maps, but his commentators
have supplied this deficiency, and recent editions of his work
contain maps poorly done of China at successive periods. The
geographical works of the Han dynasty do not contain maps.
Tte fir>t maps that have been retained in modern editions of
ancient books are those of the Sung dynasty, and they seem to
be connected with the invention of printing, which dates from
a.d. 932. It was the influence of foreign countries that caused
the Chinese to enter rigorously into the work of map-making at
this period. The Buddhists began to compile works with maps
of India and the countries through which lay the routes to India.
One of their larger works at this time contains a map of China,
of Persia and Rome, according to the geography of the Han
dynasty, and a map of India as known to the Buddhists. The
Mnhommedans followed the ht'er in teaching their notio is of
map-making to the Chinese. But all through the Sung dynasty
till the 13th century, when the Mongols established their Empire,
Chinese scholars possessed but imperfect views of geography,
and failed to obtain clear ideas either of foreign countries or of
their own in regard lo tonography. During the Mongol domina-
tion many Europeans visited China and brought with them a
certain portion of geographical knowledge. No steps, however,
were taken by the Government to improve maps and common
geographical books, which remained as bad as before. The

Chinee had junks in the Indian Ocean from the 5th century,
yet in the 16th century we find in maps of that time that Cam-
bxliaand Siam are islands; that Java lies west of Siain, that
the Greek empire (Fulin), Arabia, and Medina are three small
i-lands a little to the west of Java, and that an immense southern
continent fringes the map from a little south of Ceylon to a point
not far south of Java, and again farther east. Good maps have
only existed since the Jesuit missionaries came to China, and
they belong only to the present dynasty. The Emperors Khang-
hi and Kien-lung encouraged the survey of their dominions and
the construction of good maps. Danville's Atlas Chinois is the
result in French of the surveys made under Khang-hi by Ger-
billon and his companions. All European maps of China rest
mainly on those surveys. Among the atlases of the empire, that
made by a former governor of llonan province deserves special
praise. It is on a large scale. Each square of 200 li represents

through it depends upon the state of division of the solid, and
the abundance of its distribution through the air. Under the
most favourable circumstances, the rapid combustion or explosion
of such a mixture is of a comparatively moderate kind, as it has
to spread from one isolated particle to another. With highly
inflammable solids, the rapidity of combustion under such condi-
tions is greatest, because, as each particle burns it also evolves
inflammable vapour, and is enveloped in flame which produces cor-
responding effects upon the immediately adjacent particles. In
order to ensure rapid and complete transmission of flame through
a mixture of inflammable dust and air, it is essential that the
former should be present in great abundance, for the foregoing
reasons, and that it should therefore be considerably in excess
over the supply of oxygen in the air. The facility with which,
under these conditions, flame may be transmitted by a dust-and-
air-mixture, with a rapidity calculated to produce more or less
violently destructive effects, according to the scale upon which
the combustion occurs and the degree of confinement of the
burning mixture, has been abundantly demonstrated by accidents,
many of them very disastrous, which have occurred in works

where large quantities of inflammable dust are unavoidably pro-
duced. Thus, in the grinding of sulphur, the inflammation of
dust of that substance, consequent upon the over-heating of a
shaft-bearing, has produced an explosion sufficiently violent to
destroy the chambers within which the operation was conducted.
In cotton mills, the accidental ignition of finely divided cotton
fibre floating in the air has led to the very rapid spread of con-
flagrations throughout extensive buildings. Even in a factory
where the spent madder, or guaracin-, is ground, whereby a
much less inflammable dust than that of cotton is produced, an
important explosion occurred a few years ago. But the most
numerous and extensive calamities of this kind have taken place,
and are still of frequent occurrence, in flour and rice mills.
Many such explosions, or very rapidly spreading conflagrations,
occurring in different parts of the continent and here, prior
to 1872, appeared enveloped in mystery, until their pro-
bable cause was indicated by an Austrian observer, and soon
afterwards made clear by Dr. Watson Smith, and espe-
cially by the careful inquiry which Me-srs. Rankin and Mac-
adam instituted into the very serious and fatal explosion which
occurred at the Tradeston Flour Mills, in Glasgow, in 1872.
The origin of this explosion was conclusively traced to the striking
of fire by a pair of millstones, through a stoppage in the feed of
grain, the results being the ignition of the mixture of flour-dust
and air by which the mills, inclosed in a chamber, were sur-

rounded, and the rapid spread of flame to the mixture of dust
and air which filled the conduits leading to the exhaust box,
which communicated with the several other mills and with the
stive-room. In this way flame was so quickly transmitted through
and to various channels and confined spaces in different parts of
the building as to produce violently explosive effects almost
simultaneously in different parts of the buildings. Messrs.
Rankin and Macadam ascertained that accidents of this nature
had increased in frequency since exhaust arrangements (for col-
lection of the fine flour) had been adopted in the more extensive
mills. The precautionary measures suggested by them were,
the adoption of efficient precautions for preventing the stoppage
of the feed to the millstones, the exclusion of naked flames from
the vicinity of these and the dust passages, and the construction
of the exhaust boxes and stive-rooms as lightly as possible, and
their location outside the n.ain buildings.
The liability to the development of fire or of heat sufficient
to char or inflame portions of flour by the stoppage of the feed
of grain, appears from all accounts to be extremely difficult to
guard against, and to have been the cause of many serious
calamities even since the Tradeston explosion, examples of

in it, warranted the conclusion that coal-dust also might, under
certain conditions, originate an explosion as well as carry it on
to some considerable extent. The results obtained by the corre-
sponding experiments of the Chesterfield Committee appear to
support this view, and Mr. Galloway ha- also, by his later
experimental results, been led to the same conclusion, and con-
siders that the results of his examination into the effects pro-
duced by some of the most serious of recent coal-mine explosions
(at Penygraig, Risca, and yeahaui) demonstrate that tho>e
explosions were chiefly, if not entirely attributable to coal-dust.
Notwithstanding the considerable light that was thrown on
this subject so far back as 1845 by .Faraday and Lyell, and
the accumulation of txperimental and other observations re-
lating to the action and effect of coal-dust in colliery explo-
sions, thee have not until qnite recently received the attention
which they merit at the hands of mine owners, and many of
those in authority connected with coal-mines. Evidence collected
by the Koyal Commission on Accidents in Mines, from mine
inspectors and leading mining engineers (and published with the
preliminary Report of the Commission), show the preponderance
of opinion to be against the view that explosions could originate,

or be to any great extent propagated, by coal-dust, in the
absence of fire-damp, though the belief is entertained by many
that the coal-dust may be credited with an extension or aggrava-
tion of explosions caused by fire-damp. On the other hand,
there is a great tendency exhibited always to ascribe explosions
which do not admit of satisfactory explanation, by an accidental
failure of ventilation or other evident causes, to a sudden disen-
gagement, or outburst, of fire-damp, such as is of no uncommon
occurrence in fiery mines, and is sometimes very serious in its
magnitude and duration. That such outbursts, following upon
falls of roof and the firing of blast holes, have been the cause of
many disastrous explosions, there can be no doubt, but, in some
instances, the conclusion that an explosion had been due to this
cause, is based npon assumptions and upon very doubtful
evidence. Under any circumstances, it is extremely difficult to
realise how sufficient gas to produce an explosive atmosphere,
can be conveyed, even by the most powerful currents, from the
seat of such a sudden outburst to far distant portions of the
mine, to which the burning effects of an explosion have been
found to extend, within the period believed to have elapsed
between the first outburst of gas and the ignition of an explosive
atmosphere formed in its vicinity. On the other hand, the
evidence of severe burning, after an explosion, such as could not
be produced by the rapid explosion of a gas-mixture alone, and
the deposition of partially burned coal-dust in distinct parts of a

mine, distant from each other and from the point to which the
origin of the explosion has been traced, seem to leave no doubt
that coal-dust has played an important part in many of the
explosions which have of Jate been subjected to rigorous
investigation.
The strong impression entertained by many, during the inquiry
into the great explosion at Scaham Collieries, in September,
1SS0, that coal-dust might have had much to do with the acci-
dent, and that the explosion was possibly even entirely due to
the ignition of coal-dust by a blown-out shot, in the absence of
any fire-damp, led to Mr. Abel's being requested by the Home
Secretary to make experiments with samples of dust collected in
the mine, and to an extension of these experiments to dust col-
lected from collieries in different ] arts of the kingdom where
explosions had occurred.
The results of experiments conducted with great care and on
an extensive scale at a colliery in Lancashire, where a constant
supply of fire-damp was brought to the pit's mouth from a so-
called blower, confirmed the fact demonstrated by M. Vital and
Mr. Galloway, that the propagation of fire by coal-dust, when
thickly suspended in air, is established or greatly promoted by

addition to coal-cutting machines, which had been devised to
dispense with powder, or render its employment safe. The use
of compre sed air had been attended by some measure of suc-
cess, and the dispersion of water, used as tampinp, by the
explosion of a powder charge in the form of a spray, had been
shown to have frequenlly, though not reliably, the effect of
drowning the flame developed by the explosion. The employ-
ment of water-columns, by which the force developed by the
detonation of dynamite was uniformly transmitted throughout
the entire length of the hole, had been proved, by experiments
in coal-mines in Lancashire, and special test-experiments at
Cardiff, to render that material very suitable for coal-getting,
and at the same time to render blasting possible without libera-
tion of flame. Lastly, the employment of cylinders or cartridges
of compressed quicklime, according to a simple system elabo-
rated by Professors Smith and Moore, was referred to as ranking
before all other methods of getting coal, yet proposed, in point
of simplicity, cost, and above all, safety, and the lecturer de-

THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON
CERTAIN SEEDS
(~}N regarding seeds of our hardy trees which are sown in
^^ autumn, and which do not germinate before the return of
spring, we feel forced to admit that however the other conditions
may vary, the cause which causes the germination in the com-
mencement of the fine weather is the rise in the temperature, and
one is equally tempted to think that the higher the temperature,
as long as this rise does not equal that which would destroy the
seeds, the more active and pronounced would be the germination.
Nevertheless this is not by any means always the case, at any
rate in the seeds of the walnut and almond trees. Anxious to
germinate some of these seeds in winter, Prof. H. Baillon
thought to obtain a more rapid development in a warm house,
in which the temperature varied within the twenty-four hours
from 15°to 25° (59-77 F.), than in a cool house in which during
the same time the temperature varied between 5* and 15° (41 -
59 F.), but the trial proved a failure. In the cool-house, in the
course of six weeks, the walnuts had stems of about two deci-
metres in height, whereas the most advanced of those in the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
warm house had only stems of from two to three centimetres in
the fully developed leaves. The experiment was several times
repeated. The same quality of earth, and the same quantity of
water was used, and the results were the same. After a space
of two and a half months the greater part of the nuts sown in
the warm house had only roots occasionally well developed, but
little or no caulome outside the fruit. Moreover, the greater
part of the walnuts which germinated in a house, where there
was good bottom-heat, had roots which did not behave like
those of walnuts, germinating in the cool house and without
bottom heat, the tap root of the latter grew well in length before
any egress of the plumule, whereas the tap-roots of those grown
in the warm house were early arrested in their development, and
this through growing in a very friable soil, consisting of moist
sawdust, much less resisting than the sand or the earth of the
cool-house, in which the tap-roots developed so well. This was
very nearly the same with the almonds, and would seem to point
to the fact that in the case of some seeds there is no advantage

December 31, 1881, was 3213, against 3309 at the same time of
the previous year. The total receipts fur 18S1 had amounted to
25,810/., against 27,388/. for 18S0. The ordinary expenditure

for 1881 had been 24,651/., against 24,753/. for 1880; and the
extraordinary expenditure 1036/., against 1825/. for the pre-
ceding year. The sum of looo/. had been devoted to the repay-
ment of the mortgage debt on the Society's freehold premises,
which had thus been reduced to 6000/. This expenditure had
left a balance at the bankers of 1203/. to be carried forward for
the benefit of the present year. The assets of the Society on
December 31 'ast< af'er payment of all liabilities, were estimated
to amount to nearly 20,000/., exclusive of the value of the library
and collection of living animals. As regards the gardens in the
Regent's Park, little has been done in the way of special works
during 1881, but the buildings and walks had been kept in good
repair, and several of the former had been thoroughly repaired
and painted. The number of visitors to the Society's Gardens
in 1881 had been 648,604, against 675,979 in 1880. The zoo-
logical lectures having been well attended during the past year,
would be continued during the present season. The number of
animals in the Society's collection on December 31 last was
2294, of which 617 were mammals, 1389 birds, and 258 reptiles.
Eleven mammals, 17 birds, and II reptiles belonging to species
new to the collection had been exhibited in 1881, and during
the same year a considerable number of mammals, birds, and
reptiles of a different species (of which detailed lists were given)
had reproduced their kind in the Society's Gardens.It was

the jarring that so commonly accompanies telephonic sounds. As
the result of a series of ingeniously-contrived experiments, he
concluded that the true microphonic action, as far as it related
to the transmis-ion of articulate sounds, is due to the direct action
of air-pulses upon the temporary minute '' arc-lights " which exist
as soon as the carbon points are shaken asunder by the tremor
of the frame.Prof. Marshall submitted an account of experi-

when the pres-ure in a mass of water at a given temperature
was suddenly diminished from several tons' weight on the square

heating effect when the temperature of the water is below that
of the maximum density, a cooling effect when above. A ther-
moelectrical junction let into the pressure apparatus, and con-
nected to a delicate galvanometer, noted the changes of tem-
perature, while the pressure was measured by means of one of
Prof. Tait's high-pressure gauges, formerly described. From

regretted, as they are matters of quite as much importance
as fixed oils, &c, to which a long chapter is devoted, and
their inclusion would have certainly increased the value of
the book for all general purposes.
The chapters on paraffins, terpines, and homologues of
benzene are very clear, and in many cases detailed

advantage have been somewhat extended.
All the methods given in this section are up to date,

The chapter on the alkaloids is also a very complete
compilation of methods of detection, &c, that have been

the book will be found valuable as a reliable compilation

The quality of Mr. Allen's production atones somewhat

tell his countrymen how he had fared and what he had

utilising to some extent the material collected by his
chief. Lieut. Hovgaard, while dealing mainly with its
lighter aspects, gives a fairly complete sketch of the
voyage. The translation is well done, and the translator
deserves special credit for the intellgible way in which he
has rendered Russian names. The illustrations are not

Among these slightly protracted notes the ch, sch, i, and a

dark; I was not even able to discern whether they were to
express a sensation of pleasure or comfort, pain, or passion.
The animals seemed to be in quite a normal condition. As I
shall relate further on, I overheard afterwards a common wall-
lizard of Capri, grown blind by conjunctivitis, in the act of
producing the same sounds.
After it had been attempted to reject my statements, without
any reasoning, indeed by declaring the voice described by me to
have been the effect of a rheumatic affection of the mucous mem-
branes, which the Italian lizards had contracted in our cold
German climate, I happened to hear the same sounds from a
lizard under circumstances wholly excluding every supposition as
to its being an abnormal voice. I have shortly communicated
the fact in my paper "Untersuchungen iiber das Variiren der Mauereidechse, ein Beitrag zur Theorie von der Entwicklung

I quote the following passage :
"In 1877, having ordered a man to search the middle
Faraglione rock for lizards, I waited for his return in a little
boat at the foot of the rock. After a while, the man came down
with a number of captured lizards tied up in his pocket-handker-
chief. I was going to take a specimen of Lacerla muralis
ccctuleaCarulescens mihi which he had just released, in my
own hand, when it uttered repeatedly, in swift succession, a
series of very sharp tones, sounding like 'bschi,' and reminding
me of the hoarse piping of a mouse or a young bird."
Moreover, I mentioned that Duges already tells us of Lacerta
Edwardsii, a little lizard peculiar to the shores of the Mediter-
ranean, that it is apt to utter a sound resembling the creaking of
a Cerambyx. And he further reports that Lacota ocdlata, a
large lizard of the south, when angry, will expel its breath so
vehemently that a sort of voice is produced. And M. H.
Lan lois, of Minister, at my request, informed me last year that
Lactrta viridis was able to utter a di,tinctly hissing or blowing
sound. These reptiles on being approached on a hot summer
day, would rush furiously at their enemy, at the same time making
use of their voices, so that they were distinctly heard.
Excepting the few instances above mentioned, in which the
existence of voices in lizards has been observed, I am not aware
of any corroborative evidence preceding that discovery, a circum-
stance which is easily explained by the general taciturnity of the

On the other hand, the Tapoya Douglasii, a kind of lizard
living near the Oregon Lake, when irritated, hisses very

seems to imply that the colours of my experiments to be seen
well, should be looked at passively or without keen attention.
On the contrary, the more light thrown on them, and the keener,
fresher, and younger the eyes of the observer, the more brilliant
are the colours, and if a boy of ten or twelve years old, who
never saw anything of the sort before, be called in, he will
describe them better than grown people.
Scientific men have hitherto considered it a sufficient explana-
tion of these experiments to say the effects are "physiological,"
as if colour were ever anything else. Newton says, speaking of
coloured rays, that he uses the term merely to suit the under-
standing of the vulgar, as they are nothing but a certain power
and disposiiion to stir up a sensation of this or that colour.
Prof. Ogden Rood again classes these as subjective colours, a
word which, if it has any meaning at all beyond a very limited
one, can have none with reference to colours which remain per-

There may be difficulties in the way of deciding by direct
observation of the form of the particles, whether they are globules
or crystals. But since H. B. de Saussure, a century ago (" Essai
sur l'Hygrometrie), by means of a single lens, could distinguish
in the air over heated water, globules of condensed water of
different size, greater ones which appeared to him full, and
smaller ones which he regarded as hollow; and when in more
recent times A. Waller (Philosoph. Transactions, 1847) could
make his "microscopic observations on the so-called vesicular
vapour of water as existing in the vapours of steam and in clouds,
&c," with the result that he denied theexUtenceof mist-vesicles,
it seems possible that by means of a magnifying instrument the
form of the particles suspended in the air can be recognised.
A sure evidence, but obtainable only under favourable circum-
stances, that the particles forming a cloud are ice-crystals would
be the observation of the halos of 22° and 46° radius and of para-

powers of the telescope is increased, the number of stars that

because it is possible that the reason w hy the number of stars

IN our former article we dwelt on the deductions arrived
at by the author from a consideration of the mecha-
nical theory of cyclones. We will now proceed to examine
how far such theoretical relations are corroborated by the
results of observation. The results of observation utilised
by the author comprise those of the Rev. W. Clement
Ley, published in his "Laws of the Winds"; those of
1 "Methods and Results of Meteorological Researches for the use of the

different latitudes, in order that the navigator may be
able to modify his rules accordingly, and so avoid such a
fatal error as that of running gradually into the centre
of a storm, which a rigid adherence to Piddington's rules
would be certain to entail.
So far we have not considered what effect is produced
on the inclination by the progressive motion of a cyclone.
Were a cyclone regular in form and stationary, the in-
clination should obviously be the same at every point on
the surrounding isobars. When, as is generally the case,
it has a progressive motion, thison the supposition that
it is mainly due to the general motions of the atmosphere
should, by a simple application of the parallelogram of
velocities, alter not only the velocity but the direction of
the inflowing winds, increasing their inclination in the
rear, and diminishing it in the front part of the cyclone.
This conclusion tallies remarkably well with the ob-
servations of Padre Vines in the Antilles, where the
cyclones travel westwards, as well as with those of Prof.
Loomis in North America, where they travel towards the
east. When we come to Europe, however, a remarkable
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
exception to this rule occurs, since here the inclination
is much greater on the east or front side (especially south-
east) of a cyclone than on the west or rear side.1 The
author attempts an explanation of this fact on p. 40, but a
better one both of this and of the equally enormous
though opposite difference found by Loomis between the
inclination in the rear and front parts of cyclones in the
United States, which can hardly be altogether due to the
admittedly small velocity of the general motion of the air
over America from west to east is given by Lieut. Spindler,
of the Russian Navy, in a recent number of the Reper-
toriumj- where he considers it to be mostly due to the
friction encountered by the wind on the Continental side
of cyclones, increasing the inclination in the west and
therefore rear part of the American cyclones, and that in
the east or front part of the European cyclones.
If the general truth of the difference between the incli-
nation in the front and rear of cyclones at sea, due to their
progressive motion, be admitted, the case of the poor
navigator becomes still more complicated, as in addition
to considering latitude, distance from the centre, and
velocity of the wind, he must likewise consider in what
quadrant of the cyclone he is situated, since the direction
of the vortex with reference to that of the wind, is so
different in different quadrants. Fortunately it is just in

front of a cyclonethe most dangerous position for a
ship to be inwhere the old circular rules are least at
fault, since it is precisely here where theoretically the in-
clination should be least.
With respect to upper currents, the results derived
from theory are remarkably confirmed by those from
observation. In general, since the air flows in towards
the centre below, it must flow out from it above, and also
somewhat across the current which flows below, so that
if we stand facing the wind at the earth's surface, and at
no very great distance from the low centre, the upper
current should almost invariably flow from some point to
our right. This agrees with observation, since, accord-
ing to Clement Ley, the average direction of the upper
currents is 44° to the right of the direction from which
the surface-winds blow. The general conclusion arrived
at by Mr. Ley regarding upper currents, that they " mani-
fest a centrifugal tendency over areas of low pressure,
and a centripetal over those of high," is identical with
that arrived at by Dr. Hildebrandsson, and with the
author's theory as far as it applies to ordinary, or as he

while the cyclone was yet at the Windward Islands, about
1200 miles distant.
A sudden and abnormal rise of the barometer thus
constitutes as important a warning to a navigator as a
similar fall, or a band of cirrus-cloud, only to be able to
make effective use of this danger-signal he ought accu-
rately to know the normal height of the barometer where
he is, and at the time of year. The author shows how
this may be done in Part I., where he has constructed
charts, based on a large series of observations in the
northern hemisphere, showing not only the curves of
mean annual pressure, but also those which represent the
coefficient of annual inequality. From a simple equation
involving these two elements, the normal pressure at any
time and place can be approximately reckoned, and hence
the amount of abnormality determined.
The author next applies the cyclone theory in explana-
tion of the various inequalities of barometric pressure,
which are observed on the same latitude in different
longitudes. These inequalities he considers to be mainly
dependent on the deviations of the mean temperature
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
(annual or monthly) from the mean of all longitudes,
which he gives in a tabular form for every fifth degree
of latitude and every tenth degree of longitude in
the northern hemisphere, by means of interpolation
from the observations discussed in Part I. From these
tables it appears that in addition to, and superim-
posed upon, the general system of two polar cyclones
due to the normal differences of temperature between
the Equator and the Poles, we have throughout the
year, and more especially in the winter, the conditions
for the existence of a large fixed warm-centred cyclone in
the North Atlantic, with its centre near Iceland. The
barometric pressure should consequently be lower here
than the mean of the latitude taken round the globe.
That this is the case is well-known, and also that the pre-
valence of south-west winds in these islands is due to our
generally lying on the south-east edge of this nearly per-
petual cyclone. A similar cyclone similarly produced lies
in the North Pacific.
Two corresponding regions of abnormally low tem-
perature lie one on the east side of Asia, and the
other on the east side of America, which, according to
the author's theory, should give rise to cyclones with cold
centres. As a matter of fact, however, these conditions
are found to be completely reversed ; the pressure being
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
above the average, especially in winter, when the tem-
perature-gradients are steeper, and therefore, according
to the author's views, the cyclonic conditions should be
more developed; while the motion of the air at the surface

relative cold.
The least satisfactory part of the author's work is that
which relates to these cyclones with cold centres. Their
non-existence in the progressive form is admitted, and
where they should occur according to theory in a station-
ary form, they are notably absent, except in the two
circumpolar cyclones. It is possible, however, that they
may be identified, though in a modified form, and lacking
the central barometric depression at the earth's surface,
with what are termed " winter anticyclones," which usually
coincide with areas of great cold, and which, while they
exhibit at the earth's surface an anticyclonic outflow
of air, are fed above a certain level by a cyclonic
inflow.

accompaniment of cyclones, the author, while admitting its

ceeJed in taking a very fine and extensive photograph o'
the nebula containing most of the delicate outlying parts
which were not in my earlier photographs. This is in the
hands of the photolithographer now and will shortly be
published. The experiments have been very difficult be-
cause an exposure of more than two hours in the telescope
has been necessary, and an exceedingly minute motion of
the stars relative to the sensitive plate will become apparent
on account of the high magnifying power (180) employed.
In carrying out the second object two contrivances
have been used; first, a direct-vision prism in the cone
of rays from the objective before they had reached a
focus, and second the two-prism spectroscope with which
I have taken photographs of stellar spectra for some
years past.
During the month of March I have made two good
photographs with each of these arrangements. Those
with the direct-vision prism, without a slit, have of course
demanded that the image should be kept stationary on
the sensitive plate throughout the exposure, viz. two
hours, and they are as difficult to get as good photographs

of the nebula itself. On the contrary, those obtained with
the slit spectroscope do not require the same steadfast
attention.
The results derived from these photographs are inter-
esting partly from what they show and partly from what
they promise in the future. A number of photographs,
under various conditions, will be needed for the full
elucidation of the subject.
The most striking feature is perhaps the discovery of
two condensed portions of the nebula just preceding the
trapezium, which give a continuous spectrum. At those
places there is either gas under great pressure or liquid or
solid. I have not been able to detect any stars of sufficient
magnitude in these portions to produce this effect either
in my photographs of the nebula or in any of the well-
known drawings of this object. It seems to me also that
the photographs show evidence of continuous spectrum
in other parts of the nebula. In these respects the con-
clusions arrived at by Lord Rosse in his memoir (Phil
Trans. Royal Society, June 20, 1867, p. 70) are to a certain
extent borne out.
The hydrogen line near G, wave-length 4340, is strong
and sharply defined ; that at k, wave-length 4101, is more
delicate, and there arc faint traces of other lines in the
violet. Among these lines there is one point of difference,

especially well shown in a photograph where the slit was
placed in a north and south direction across the tra-
pezium ; the Hy line, X 4340, is of the same length as the
slit, and where it intersects the spectrum of the trapezium
stars, a duplication of effect is visible. If this is not due
to flickering motion in the atmosphere, it would indicate
that hydrogen gas was present even between the eye and
the trapezium. I think the same is true of the H8 line,
X 4101. But in the case of two other faint lines in this
vicinity, I think the lines are not of the length of the slit,
one being quite short and the other discontinuous. If
this observation should be confirmed by future photo-
graphs of greater strength, it might point to a non-
homogeneous constitution of the nebula, though dif-
ferences of intrinsic brightness would require to be
eliminated.
The April number of the American Journal of Science
contains an account of a photograph of the spectrum of
this nebula taken by Dr. Huggins. I have not found the
line at X 3730, of which he speaks, though I have other
lines which he does not appear to have photographed.

and in order to maintain it in its "natural" condition it
would have been better if the Conservators had taken
counsel with some of the numerous scientific societies of
London which are representative of the various classes of
natural history students and investigators. This is indeed
the only pointbut it is a serious oneon which we feel
compelled to express our disappointment at the line of
management taken up by the Conservators. The Epping
Forest Committee consists of twelve members of the Cor-
poration and four Verderers chosen septennially by the
commoners of the Forest parishes. Now a Committee
appointed to deal with a scientific questionand as such
we regard the management of a forestcannot altogether
ignore the claims of natural history without incurring the
risk of having their proceedings compared with the
tragedy of Hamlet with the Prince of Denmark left out
The present Verderers are Sir T. Fowell Buxton, Mr. E.
N. Buxton, the Chairman of the London School Board, Mr.
Andrew Johnston, late High Sheriff of Essex, and Mr. D.

How to deal with those waste stretches of land formerly
under cultivation is a question quite distinct from the
management of the wooded portions of the forest. While
for the latter a minimum of interference would in our
opinion be most in accordance with the views of all
parties, there are ample opportunities of "landscape
gardening" the former. In face of this fact it is some-
what surprising that the energies of the Conservators
should thus far have been chiefly directed to alterations
in the natural portions of the area under their charge,
and we are glad to see that the Essex Naturalist's Field
Club has taken the initiative in inviting the co-operation
of all natural history students interested in the preserva-
tion of open spaces in their natural condition, in signing a
protest against the destruction of the natural features of
Epping Forest. The form of petition has been forwarded
to all the scientific societies of London most concerned in
this question, and has already received many influential
signatures. If the dedication ceremony of last Saturday
makes the freeing of the Forest an event in the history
of this country, it seems but just that in a period pre-
eminently distinguished for its scientific culture, the
naturalists of London should urge their claims ere it be
too late. R. M.

THE WINTER OF 1881-2
""PHE fine winter months of 1881-2, from November to
* March, have been characterised by a mildness
rarely equalled in our British climate. Nowhere in the
British Islands, from Scilly to Shetland, or from Dover
to Valentia, was the mean excess above the normals of
the temperature of these five months less than 2°'o.
This was the excess in the south of England; in central
districts/such as Oxford and York, it rose to 3°o; and
the excess increased on advancing northward till it
reached 43 o in the upper districts of the Tweed, Clyde,
Tay, and Dee, and at Culloden, and Lairg. Every-
where on the coasts the temperature was from half a
degree to a degree, relatively lower than in strictly inland
situations.
In Scotland the mean temperature of each of the months
exceeded its normal, except in a very few localities in
December, when temperature was slightly under the
average. Each of the other months had a temperature
from 2-5 to 6°x> above the normal. In England, on the
other hand, the temperature of January was pretty gene-

the mildness of the winter of 1881-82 has only been twice
exceeded, viz. in 1789-90, when it was 4°-2, or o°-i more,
and in 1778-79, when it was 5°-2, or lc,l more. The
winter of 1845-46 showed the same excess as last winter.
We also gather from the table that these winters, which
gave a mean excess of 3°"o, were immediately followed
by summers warmer than usual, the mean six months'
excess being about a degree (oc-8). Indeed, of the whole
seventeen summers, only one, viz. the summer of 1790,
can be considered as showing a deficiency of temperature
sufficiently great and prolonged to be regarded as attended
with serious consequences to agriculture. The table is a
striking general confirmation of the prognostic long and
widely entertained that a mild winter is the precursor of
a fine warm summer.

to place at the disposal of art. Nowhere have the dis-
coveries of science been more useful or more utilised than
at the celebrated porcelain manufactory of Sevres, and
the illustrations which we give to day will afford some idea
of the beautiful results which are thus produced. As
a permanent record of successful scientific efforts, nothing
could be more satisfactory and appropriate. In Fig. 1 the
characteristic features of the Arctic regions are rendered
with almost perfect success and truthfulness; while the
allegorical representation in Fig. 2, in commemoration of
the last transit of Venus, is happy in conception, and
charming in effect. Of the artistic merits of the two
vases our readers can judge for themselves. It may be
interesting to give some idea of the difficulties attending
the manufacture of such delicate productions, which we
are able to do, from a lecture by M. Ch. Lauth, Ad-
ministrator of the Sevres manufactory, published in La
Nature, to which journal also we are indebted for our
illustrations.
Fig. 1 represents a vase which has been presented to
King Oscar of Sweden, and is one-eighth of the original
size. The splendid vase represented in Fig. 2 is still only
in course of execution, and when complete will be placed
in the Mazarin Gallery of the French National Library;
it will be ten times the size of the illustration. M.

Lauth thinks the national institution at Sevres should
be organised more as a school for the training of
workers in the delicate art, than as a mere manu-
factory. The art of fixing colours on pottery, M.
Lauth tells us, differs essentially from that which deals
with the colouring of any other medium. There is
required in the materials perfect adhesion, absolute re-
sistance to atmospheric influences, and a brilliancy which
will make the colours seem part of the object itself. As
the colours must be subjected to a very high temperature,
there must be eliminated from the palette of the ceramic
artist all organic colouring matter, and all the unstable
mineral colours; he must have recourse to oxides, metallic
silicates, or to metals. And the fixation of these colours
is always the result of a chemical action, of a combination
which takes place at a high temperature between the
body of the porcelain and the matters used in its decora-
tion. Many different methods are used for the purpose,
but they are divided into two great classesdecoration at
great heat, and the decoration by muffle, an oven of a
special kind.

BRITISH FOSSIL CEPHALOPODS
A Monograph of the British Fossil Cephalopoda. Part I.
Introduction and Silurian Species. By J. F. Blake,
Esq., M.A., F.G.S., Professor of Natural Science in
University College, Nottingham. (London: J. Van
Voorst, 1882.)
FOR the first time has just appeared Part I. of a
monograph upon the British Palaeozoic Tetra-
branchiate Cephalopoda, and important as this group of
Mollusca has ever been regarded by all palaeontologists
and badly as such has been wanted by all students of
British Palaeozoic geology, no one has hitherto attempted
any history of this group for Britain. Barrande has
elaborately done so for Bohemia and De Koninck for
Belgium, both have extensively written upon the older
Cephalopoda [Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and Car-
boniferous]. Barrande in his exhaustive work illustrates
no less than 1620 Silurian species. De Koninck in his
last important work upon the Carboniferous Limestone of
Belgium enumerates 170 species, amongst them many new
forms and many common to British strata. Prof. J. F.

Blake intends completing this history of the British Palaeo-
zoic Cephalopoda in two volumes. The part now issued,
being part or vol. i., treats only of Silurian species. No
less than 244 quarto pages and 31 plates are devoted
to the description of 11 genera and 6 sub-genera, and 143
species. The great genus Orthoceras being illustrated by
76 species, and its 4 sub-genera by 6 species, Cyrtoceras
23 species, Poterioceras 2, Comphoceras 11, Phragmoceras
7, Ascoceras 3, Nautilus 4, its sub-genus Trochilites 3,
Trochoceras 12, Lituites 2, Ophidioceras 2, and Goniatites
(?) 2 species. These 143 species range from theTremadoc
Rocks, of the Cambrian series, to the Tile-stones of the
Upper Ludlow. Forty of the 145 species also occur in
Europe and America, or 32 are common to Europe and
6 to America, thus showing the wide distribution of
certain genera and species. Thirty-one plates accompany
the letterpress or text, every species being figured, and more
than 2000 specimens have been examined by the author
having reference to the history and description of these
143 species. Prof. Blake has given on pp. 233-6 a table of
the distribution in time of all the species, and on p. 237 a
condensed table showing the "growth, culmination, and
decay of the genera and group." These two tables are
suggestive, and the outcome of their study shows that
there were two maxima of individual abundance, one

occurring in the older group of rocks, the Caradoc or
Bala, and the other, in the Lower Ludlow, yet we feel
assured that there was no real diminution or falling off in
the variety of forms between these two deposits. The
tables clearly show that the species in the Wenlock Lime-
stone were (or are now found to be) comparatively few as
compared with those in the shales above and below, and
would indicate that the Cephalopoda of the Wenlock seas
were not commonly frequenters of clear and shallow
waters, but were partly pelagic and possibly gregarious in
more or less turbid waters, as indicated by the impure
sediments composing the Ludlow shales.
Prof. Blake has proposed a classification of the Nau-
Vol. xxvi.No. 654
tiloidea based upon the general form of the shell, and
having a variable siphuncle. He places all the Palaeozoic
forms under four groups: 1, the Conici; 2, the Inflati;
3, the Spiralisj and 4, the Irregulares. The 18 genera
being naturally distributed through these four groups.

apertures, and singularly inflated, fusiform, pyriform, or
flask-shaped shells, are the genera Phraginoccras, Gompho-
ceras, Poterioceras, and Ascoceras, and placed under the
group " Ittflciti" by the author. The other two groups of
the Nautiloideathe Spirales and the Irregulares
possess so great a shell curvature that they assume the
form of whorls, which may or may not be in contact.
This fact appears of sufficient importance to justify Mr.
Blake in regarding it as the basis for establishing the
group "Spirales," in which is placed the genera Nautilus,
Gyroccras, Trochilites, and Clymenia, Sec, finally through
peculiarity of form, such as want of symmetry, or loss of,
or changes in curvature, are many of peculiar aspect,

Ophidioccras, and Cryptoceras. These researches have
led to the construction of the table of classification above

given.
Prof. Blake commences his systematic description of
the species with the genus Orihoceras. No less than 70
species in this genus are described by the author, ranging
from the Tremadoc rocks to the uppermost Ludlow beds
(the Tile-stones). The species mostly abound in the
Bala beds, the Wenlock shales, and the two Ludlows.
The literature or bibliography of the species of the Ortho-
cerata, their descriptions, and that of the 5 sub-genera is
of the greatest value, and an addition to our knowledge
of this oldest known genus in the British rocks; Cyrto-
ceras being its only associate in the Tremadoc beds.
The sub-divisions of the genus by Quenstedt, M'Coy, De
Koninck, and Barrande are given. Mr. Blake adopts
Barrande's views and grouping of the Orthocerata into
two groups: (1) the Brcvicones; and (2) the Longicones.
The latter, which is very numerously represented, Mr.
Blake divides into the Aimulati, the Angulati, the
Lineali, the Imbricati, and lastly the group Leves. In
this latter group is temporarily placed all species whose
external surface is unknown. Then follows concise but
clear descriptions of the five sub-generaActinoceras,
Endoceras, Tretoceras, Conoceras, and Gonioceras. For
the first time we now have the 70 British species of
Orthocerata brought together, and most ably described
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and figured; 3 species belong to the group "Brevicones"
and 67 to the group "¦Longicones." Of these, 20 species
fall under the group Annulati, 6 under the Angulati, 13
under the Lineali, 7 under Imbricati, and 22 in the group
Leves. We are now able to investigate all the known
species of this extensive Palaeozoic genus, and no student
need be at a loss to determine, either through original
description and drawing, or the reproduction of type
species, any forms that he may meet with in the Silurian
rocks of the British Islands. The author's plan of first
describing in every instance the type of the species, is of
extreme value, as it at once (if a known species) clears up
its history; this with reference to the original figure and
description by the author, and its reproduction in the
monograph, ensures and affords every chance of right
determination. Following the '" type" is the general de-
scription, then its relation to other known forms, British
or foreign, followed by its distribution in time or space;
this plan is implicitly followed throughout the entire
volumeit is clear, definite, and systematic. The next
important group described by Mr. Blake are the Cyrto-

equivalent to M'Coy's sub-genus Temnocheilusj 4, the
Sinuosi, those with sinuous sutures; and 5, those species
with nummuloid siphuncles (Trias only).
Probably only three species of Nautilus occur in the
Silurian rocksA autilus quadrans, N. Holtianus, and
^V. Bohemicus. This last-named species appears to be
the Lituiics Biddulphi of Sowerby (1838); but his insuf-
ficient description, in the " Sil. Syst." of Murchison, pre-
vents true identification. They are all three Upper
Silurian forms. The Lower Silurian rocks of Newfound-
land and Canada have yielded eleven species. In the
Carboniferous strata Nautilus attains through Discites its
maximum development. In the Permian only one species
is British, and three American, and is now the only living
representative of the Tetrabranchiata. The sub-genus
Trocholites (three species are Lower Silurian. These six
forms are the only true Nautiloidea in the Silurian rocks.
The last group (4, the Trrcgularcs) in Mr. Blake's
classification receives three genera: Trcchoceras, with 12
species; Lituitcs, 2 ; and Ophidioceras, 2 species. We
have no representative of either the Endogastric or Exo-

%astric group of Barraude in this country. American and
Swedish Lower Silurian species are somewhat abundant,
in Britain it is chiefly an Upper Silurian genus. Of the
12 species known 8 are Upper SilurianWenlock and
Ludlowand the Llandilo, Bala, and Llandovery beds
yield the remaining Trochoceri. Five of the 12 species
are new to Britain, described and figured by Prof. Blake
for the first time. The two type speciesTrochoceras
(Lituites) cornu arietes (Sowerby), and Trochoceras (Litu-
ites) gigantcum (Sowerby)are admirably refigured and
described by Mr. Blake, the general descriptions adding
to their specific value, and the determiuation of Bohemian
forms of Lituites in Britain materially adds to the corre-
lation of the two faunas. Barrande's genus Ophidioceras
(Lituites, auct.) seems to have been recognised by Mr.
Blake; it differs from typical Lituites by the whorls being
accurately in contact. The Lituitcs articulatum, Sow.,
was long ago figured as Lituites in the "Sil. System,"
p. 622, t. 11, f. 5, and adopted by Salter. The straight
ribbing and band distinguishes this genus from Lituites.
This volume concludes with general observations, and
highly suggestive many of them are. Prof. Blake en-
deavours to throw some light upon the laws which govern
the appearance and disappearance of forms of life, and
into the nature of those groups of individuals to which we
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
assign the term species.
Mr. Blake prepares a table, condensed from the larger
and preceding one on pp. 233-236. This condensed table
shows the numerical value of the species occurring in the
11 genera, and ranging through the ten formations or
horizons, thus showing their increment, decrement, and
stratigraphical distribution. Both tables show three
maxima in the Ludlow, Wenlock, and Bala bedsin the
Ludlow 65 species, the Wenlock 43, and the Bala 39.
Mr. Blake does not believe that there was a correspond-
ing falling off between these epochs; he draws conclu-
sions from the comparative fewness of species in the
Wenlock Limestone as compared with the Ludlow shales
above and Wenlock shales below that formation. Of
the four groups given the Conici first appear, and con-
stitute the bulk of the Lower Silurian fauna, 31 species
occurring in the Bala rocks [the Tremadoc only yielding
two species, the Llandcilo 9, and the Lower Llandovery
8, or 19 for the three horizons]. The Con ici and Spiralcs
are the only two groups which continue on in time or
range into the higher divisions of the Palaeozoic rocks

ing epoch, especially as the intervening links are, in all
probability, absent."
Mr. Blake selects certain species of Crthocerata which
may have been produced by descent; at the least it is
only supposition, and he states that there is no proof that
they arc actually so connected, but to the general theory
of evolutionwhich merely states that every form of life
has been developed from a preceding one nearly allied to
itthe present study affords no contradiction or difficulty
but affords aidwhich if not so great as could be desired,
is yet as much as could be expected. In the present
study of the Palaeozoic Cephalopoda we have a fair repre-
sentative of a successive fauna of the same class, and
the species are grouped round a series of central types;
and so long as the surrounding circumstances remain
constant and the same, the process of evolution by in-
definite variation and survival of the fittest should either
be uniform, and leave relics having no special grouping,
or it should cease when the best adaptation to the sur-
rounding circumstances or conditions had been acquired.
These views are expressed and carefully argued by Prof.

Blake, in the concluding pages of his work. "The great
defect," writes Mr. Blake, "of the theory of natural selec-
tion is that it leaves the original variation, which is the
basis of the whole to chance; chance variations are not
likely to lead to any law." "The part which it has
effectually performed is to show how variations of the
individual may produce permanent changes in the species,
and thus break down the idea of the fixity and independ-
ence of the latter." "We are, perhaps," says the author
"as yet too dazzled by the brilliancy of the theory to per-
ceive its inadequacy as a complete account of life or to
place it as one link only in the chain of explanations."
The "General Observations" of Prof. Blake on pp.
237-44 are a fitting termination to the laborious part
undertaken by him in describing the 145 Silurian species.
The work has been most carefully and honestly done, and
nowfor thefirst timewe possess a completemonographupon
the Tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda of the oldest Palaeozoic
rocks; no less than 31 quarto plates illustrate the species,
and all are drawn life-size. Mr. Blake^has examined
2000 well-characterised specimens, and has visited all the
museums and private collections in Britain likely to con-
tain materials for his work, and as he remarks, the work
includes a description of every known specimen so far as
it presents any available characters.

The fragmentary state of nine-tenths of the specimens
collected, demanded from the author the most careful
examination, whether by comparison or through descrip-
tion of specimens, and those who know the condition of
Silurian Cephalopoda as occurring in this country will
indeed appreciate the critical labour of Prof. Blake; he
has rendered great service to palaeontology. The book
was the one want, as a completion to the works of
Murchison, McCoy, Salter, and Sowerby in Britain; a
companion to the grand monographs by Barrande upon
the Cephalopoda of the Silurian Rocks of Bohemia, also a
fitting accompaniment to the monograph by De Koninck
upon the same group for the Silurian and Carboniferous
Rocks of Belgium. No library devoted to natural science
should be without this first volume, and no student of
Palaeozoic species can do without it. No group of inverte-
brata are of such importance to the stratigraphical
geologist as the Cephalopoda; in Britain alone the
Palaeozoic species number nearly 400, and in Bohemia

familiar. Konigs method of introducing a small tube commu-
nicating with a manometric capsule and a flame indicator, was
recently described in our Physical Notes. The latest device for
a similar purpose is that of M. Serra-Carpi, who introduces a
small microphone supported on an elastic membrane stretched
over a wire ring. The microphone is connected by wires to a
telephone and a battery. Hardly any sound is heard except
when the exploring microphone is at a node, when it causes a
buzzing sound to be heard in the telephone. The objection to
all these methods is that the pressure of the explorer alters the
position of the nodes in the tuhe. K6nigs apparatus is probably
least open to this objection, but it requires a special piece of
apparatus of an expensive kind.
THE _/OINTING OF ROCKS AND THE
CHANNEL T UNNEL
THE writer, referring in the first instance to his  Report" on
jointing, published in vol. xxv. (1875) of the T ranrarlzbm
of the Royal Irish Academy, in which the subject is treated of in
its purely geological aspect, remarks that his investigations in
connection with it entitle him to take a part in the discussion of
a question in engineering, which public enterprise has of late
elevated to one of international importance.
At the outset, however, he feels himself compelled to express

his doubts that rock-jointing has been suliiciently attended to by
the active promoters of the proposed Channel Tunnel.
The remarkable divisional structure under consideration, often
taken to be analogous to ordinary cracks or fractures due to
rock-disruption, is, in the opinion of Prof. King, a phenomenon
having only a distant relation in its origin to the latter.
In its normal state, jointing is a fis=ured condition of rocks-
the fissures presenting even, smooth, regular, and close-fitting
conjunctive planes, often standing vertically, or in an inclined
position. Where the fissures have been affected by stratic dis-
turbances, or have been acted on by water and other erosive
agencies, they are more or less open, thereby converted into
 crevices." It divides both sedimentary beds and igneous
masses ; and is separable into two or more series or systems,
each having its respective fissures running in parallelism, also
in a definite and an independent direction, over areas hundreds
of miles in extent ; and descending to considerable depths below
the earths surface. The fissures vary in their distance from one
another from under half an inch to t\vo or more feet.
That jointing demands the closest attention on the part of
engineers engaged in sub-aqueous works requires no other proof
than the fact of the utter failure which attended the scheme for
opening out, during the famine of |845-48, a water communica-
tion, about four miles in length, between Lough Corrib and
Lough Mask, in the west of Ireland. After an expenditure of

4o,oooI. it was found that the jointing in the carboniferous lime-
stone, through which the excavation had been made, carried off
all the water. The work had, therefore, to be abandoned ; thus
resulting in nothing more than a dry ditch !
As regards the chalk and other rocks to be penetrated for the
Channel Tunnel, Prof. King admits that they may not be so
highly jointed as the much older carboniferous limestone ; never-
theless, he shows that the former deposits are not altogether free
from dangers, which, to be overcome, require the closest
attention.
From the numerous occurrences, noticed by writers, and ob-
served by hirnself, of faults, true jointing,3 ordinary disruptive
fractures, inclined bedding openings, dry submarine swallow-
holes of Pliocene a (now filled with clay, sand, gravel, in some
cases containing subffossil sea-shells) and rock porosity in the
chalk formations of Kent, Prof. King infers that these detriments
are equally present in the same deposits, well known to exist at
the bottom of the Channel ; where some of them cannot but tum

well Cliff. These sands and clays form the Headon group;
they consist of freshwater strata with bands of limestone and
lignite, but including numerous inconstant intercalations of
layers containing marine shells, for the most part much dwarfed.
The age of the Headon group, as shown by the fossils which it
contains, is that of "the zone of Cerithium concavum of conti-
nental authors. The brackish-water Headon group is succeeded
a] Whitecliff Bay by nearly 100 feet of purely marine strata.
These marine beds, which had been shown to rest on an eroded
surface of the Headon beds, contain the remarkable fauna which
had been recognised by many British and foreign geologists as
that of the Lower Oligocene. Similar strata with the same
fossils are found in the New Forest, at Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst,
Roydon, and other points, and there also attain a considerable
thickness. It was pointed out that this marine series is quite
distinct from the Headon, or zone of Cerilhium concavum, with
which it had been confounded. The author had been very
severely criticised for the views which he had put forward in a
former paper as to the manner in which the Brockenhurst series
is represented in the section at the west end of the Isle of Wight.

correlating the beds seen in Colwell Bay with those exposed in
the cliffs of Headon Hill. With several previous authors
on the subject, he maintained that the great series of sand-
stones and limestones forming Warden Point and How Ledge are
continuous with those exposed in the face nf Headon Hill, and,
consequently, that the marine beds of Colwell Bay, overlying
those lime-tone series are younger than the brackish-water bands
interstratified with the Hrddon beds of Headon Hill. His
critics, however, insisted that these two beds agreed with one
another in such a manner that they must be regarded as parts of
the same bed, separated by denudation. In opposition to this
view, it was pointed out that the Colwell Bay bed is of the most
inconstant character, and long before reaching Headon Hill is
seen to be on the point of thinning out and disappearing alto-
gether. In conclusion, the author pointed out that his own
interpreiation of tht succession and correlation of the strata in
the Hampshire basin brings them into complete harmony with
that w hich is maintained by the great majority of continental
geologists, while that of his critics appeared to be hopelessly
irreconcileable with their views.

the experiments made thereon by Devil e. Troost proved that
dissociation is a function of the temperatu e, that it is indepen-
dent of mass, and that the action is reve sible; the process
re-embles in many respects the condensation and volatilisation
of a vapour. The experiments in which vapours are conducted
along heated porous tubes, only prove that dissociation takes
place, but do not tell us the extent of the dissociation. Exact
determinations of the partial pressures obtained by heating
various substances, as ammoniocbloride of silver, water, &c, to
certain temperatures have been made, and thus curves hive been
drawn, which, by inspection, show the pressure necessary to
prevent the decomposition of a substance at any particular tem-
perature. Recent investigations have shown that solid sub-
stances have a temperature analogous to the " critical point " of
gases, above which they cannot exist; thus, when hydrogen
sulphide and water are subjected to great pressure at low tem-
peratures, a crystalline hydrate is formed, but above 40° C. this
subtance cannot be shown to exist, however great the pressure
may be. If a mixture of hydrogen and iodine be heated to
about 300° C., some hydriodic acid is formed ; if hydriodic acid
lie heated to 300° C, free hydrogen and iodine are formed, and

also instituted for the corresponding annua/ variations at Ma-

equableness was shown to exist. Observations with the wet-
and dry-bulb thermometer, and spectroscopic indications of the
"rain-band " proved the climate of Madeira to be at the same
time remarkably humid, which at once explains its cold summers
and warm winters. This striking humidity the author traced to
the influence of the Gulf Strea n, a branch of which trends
south from the Bay of Biscay past the coast of Portugal. That
the ocean waters around Madeira are peculiarly warm, was demon-
strated by the late Sir Wy ville Thomson in the Challenger Expe-
dition. The abundant presence of watery vapour in the atmo-
sphere also seems to have a marked influence upon the flora and

organs, and that the capillaries extend into the hypoderm, as in
the leech.Prof. Heddle, in the first of three notes, described
a leaf-bed which he had discovered at the base of a high preci-
pice at the north-west corner of the island of Canna. The bed
consists of a highly laminated brown clay, easily split by tapping
or by inserting the edge of a knife. This clay, when it comes
down to the water's edge, is acted upon by the waves to form
the so-called Fuller's earth. In the second note, the author

It is different with the decoration accomplished by
means of a muffle oven; in this method the painting is
always made on baked porcelain, and consequently on
enamel, and the heat employed is relatively low. In this
process there is necessary, in order to make the colours

By raising the temperature, these bodies are fused, attack

cording to the nature of the fondants and colours, a
greater or less heat may be applied; and as certain

necessary to bake at successive fires of different tem-

PHYLLOXERA
"T\R. MARION has recently published (Dupont, Paris,
*-' 1882) a risumd of the results attending the efforts
of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Railway Company
to stay the ravages of phylloxera. These efforts were
inaugurated in 1876 at a time when the wine growers of
Herault were on the point of relinquishing the struggle.
Dumas having demonstrated the great value of alkaline
sulphocarbonates as insecticides, this company energeti-
cally planned and organised its distribution, with such
success that in the period between 1877 and 1881 the
number of barrels distributed through their agency rose
from 1085 to 14149. The sulphocarbonate is injected
twice a year in doses of 12 grammes into holes half a
metre apart, being either administered in simple doses or
double doses, with an interval of three or four days. The
doses vary, however somewhat, according to the nature
of the soil and condition of the vines, and much is there-
fore left to the intelligence of the operator. The remedy
acts imperfectly in clayey or stiff soils, and when the
ground is saturated.
The first injury manifested when vines are attacked
is the loss of their finer radicles, which perish through
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the suction of the aphid. The consequent loss of nutri-
tion next causes the partial death of old wood and
feebleness in the young shoots, followed by a gradual
diminution in the fruit. If badly attacked, old vines
cannot be saved, as much of the woody stem is dead
beyond recovery, but young vines almost always recover
under the sulphocarbon treatment, when applied under
favourable conditions; new radicles appear, then an in-
creasing luxuriance in the foliary organs, and finally the
renewed production of fruit. Dr. Marion strongly advo-
cates the use of this remedy, and sustains his arguments
by well selected examples which thoroughly demonstrate
its efficacy. It is capable of a wide application, the prices
realised for wines in most districts being well able to
support its cost.
Other remedies found practicable, but not discussed in Dr. Marion's work, are submersion, and replacement by American stock, with or without grafting. The former can only be practised in comparatively flat or low-lying vineyards in proximity to rivers or canals. These are surrounded by strong embankments of from one to one and a h high; and the waters are either let ine of level at flood times or by centrifugal

about a hundred miles to the southward, it was often
necessary to depend more on the density of the water, on
account of the subsidence of the sediment.
Without entering into the details it may be sufficent to
state that, whilst the waters of the Yang-tse, according to
my observations, became permanently free from sedi-
ment, and assumed the more marked characters of sea-
water, with a minimum density of roi8, at a distance of
about forty miles east of Wusung, they still retained their
yellow colour and turbid appearance, with a density vary-
ing between 1 '005 and 1 'oi 1, on the outskirts of the
Chusan archipelago, about a hundred miles to the south-
ward. From these data the conclusion may very naturally
be drawn that the main body of the water discharged by
the Yang-tse flows comparatively undisturbed in a southerly
direction across the Hang-chu Bay to the Chusan archi-
pelago. The southerly extension of the muddy waters of
the Yang-tse in the neighbourhood of Chusan  must have
been a frequent subject of remark to any one approaching

Shanghai from the southward, and should he at some
subsequent period undertake the voyage from that port to
Nagasaki, he will be very probably surprised to find him-
self, some four or five hours after leaving Wusung, sur-
rounded by the green waters of the Eastern Sea. The
situation of the Great Yang-tse bank, which extends one
hundred and fifty miles to the north-east from the mouth
of the river, would appear to negative the conclusion at
which I have arrived; but I am inclined to view this
banklying as it does rather off the entrances to the
river, and composed as it is of fine grey sandas rather
the work of a past period, when perhaps the bulk of the
waters found a passage to the north of the island of
Tsung-ming, than as being in actual formation at present.
That a vast amount of sediment is deposited to the south-
ward of the estuary at the present time we have the most
undoubted testimony in the rapid shoaling of the sea
amongst the islands of the Chusan archipelago, and
along the shores of the Hang-chu Bay, which has caused
channels at one time navigable for junks to be now impassable.
With reference to the general effect of the water dis-
charged by the Chinese rivers on the density of the
Yellow Sea and of the Gulf of Pe-chili, I may observe
that in the month of October I found the specific gravity
to rise slowly from roio, at the base of the Great Yang-tse

banka point between fifty and sixty miles east of
Wusungto i"023 amongst the islands of the Corean
archipelago; and that the maximum of 1 '024 was attained
at a point mid-way between this archipelago and the
Shantung promontary. North of this cape the density
does not vary in any marked degree, but after the Miau-
tau Islands were passeda group which separates the
Gulf of Pe-chili from the Yellow Seathere was a
gradual diminution,until, at our nearest point of approach
to the Yellow River, the mouth of which was forty-five
miles distant, the specific gravity was l'02l. This slight
fall in the density was the only indication of our proximity
to such a large river as the Hoang-hoa circumstance
which has a particular bearing on the excessive amount of
sediment which this river has been estimated to discharge
(vide Nature, voL xxii. p. 487). From this point to the
mouth of the Pei-ho the specific gravity continued to de-

of Mull and Arrochar. On the way down a dyke
much more vitreous and obsidian-like than the other
Arran pitch-stone, was crossed on the ridge between
Caisteal Abhail and Cir Mhor, at the head of Glen
Sannox. Another day the steps of the party were turned
southwards, and as the red rocks of Glen Shurig, which
runs inland from 13rodick,had hitherto yielded no organic
remains capable of identifying their precise geological
position, the Professor instituted a methodical search,
which resulted in the discovery of numerous more or less
distinct impressions of the lycopod psilnphyton, clearly
proving them to be, as he had inferred, of Lower Old
Red Sandstone age. Striking southward into Glen Dubh,
the geologists then crossed the very perfect series of
moraines, left there by the last valley glacier, and return-
ing by Glen Cloy, and the well-known pitchstone dyke
behind the Brodick Schoolhouse. The fossiliferous lime-
stones and shales of Corrie were also well explored, and

the position of this strata far down in the heart of the
red sandstone series was remarked.
The concluding ramble of the week brought the party
to the celebrated dyke of pitchstone at Corriegills, and
the quartz-porphyry of Dur Dubh, both possibly of
Tertiary age.
The latter rock is alike remarkable for its petrographical
characters and its geological structure and history. The
quartz in it has crystallised into singularly perfect doubly-
terminated pyramids, which can be picked up in handfuls
from weathered crannies of the rock. Viewed from the
north, the end of the quartz-porphyry ridge is seen to
present a remarkable columnar arrangement, the columns
radiating from a common centre like the ribs of a fan.
The Professor pointed out the resemblance of this struc-
ture to that of the west end of the Scuir of Eigg, where
a stream of vitreous lava has flowed into and filled up a
narrow valley, the sides of which have disappeared, and
where the radial structure of the pitchstone is due to the
rock having cooled in an approximately semicylindrical
gorge, perpendicular to whose sides the columns were
formed. In each case the superior durability of the mass
has enabled it to resist denudation better than the sur-
rounding rocks, which have long ago been carried off,
leaving the lava standing upas a prominent ridge. Most

An interesting account has been lately furnished by M. Plateau,
the eminent Belgian physicist (who has been blind nearly forty
years), of the sensations he experiences in his eyes. He has no
.-ense of objective light even when directing his eyes towards the

which are pretty bright and others sombre or nearly dark, and
which merge into each other. Their general tint alternates, in
time, between grey and reddish. The relative arrangement of
those different spaces is always the same, but the intensity of
their tints varies. The central space seems now rather bright,
now very dark; above and below, and on the left to the limits
of the field, there is sometimes brightness, sometimes darkness,
but on the right there is generally a vertical band, nearly black,
and beyond this a space which is nearly always bright and
reddish. These appearances follow all the movements of the
eyes, which probably do not participate in the same way in the

from what belongs to the other. No connection of the general
tint with the work of digestion is observed. The author states
that he became blind through looking fixedly at the sun for some
time, with a view to observing his after-fensations; it was not
till about fourteen years after this that inflammation of the
choroid set in, destroying vision, but, during the interval, he
often saw coloured and persistent halos round flames, &c, and
he advises those who have such vision to consult an experienced
oculist.

The Comparative Action of Isomeric and Meta-
meric Compounds on the Growth of Plants.In an
interesting pap.-r on this subject, lately laid before the Royal
Irish Academy by Prof. Emerson Reynolds F.R.S., he calls
attention to an apparently neglected subject, and he shows that
well-marked differences in physiological activity can be detected
with the aid of plants, even in cases of metameric bodies of com-
paratively simple constitution. The bodies he selected for ex-
periment were ammonium sulphocyanate and its metamer, theo-
carba-niie or sulpho-urea. Both compounds are rich in nitrogen,
and therefore capable of supplying a highly important element
of plant food; they are easily soluble in water. The experiments
were made in the summer of 18S1 on plants of Nicotima longi-
flora. They listed over three monthsAugust to end of
November; a cTtain number of the plants were watered with
rain-watera certain number with the compounds in solution,
otherwise all the plants were exposed to the like conditions. The
following were among the chief results :

It would then seem (1) that the particular elements of which a
body is composed exert less influence on the physiological activity
of the c impound than the intra-molecular grouping of the com-
ponent atoms; (2) that in some instances at least differences of
physiological activity between metameric bodies can be easily

Caucasian Milk Ferment.The inhabitants of the high-
lyin* lands in the Caucasus prepare, by fermentation of cows'
milk, a drink which they call kephir. Kephir is used by the
inhabitants of the mountains not only as an article of food, but
also as a remedy against different diseases. As a ferment in the
preparation of this drink, strange white lumps are used, which
have a spherical or elliptical shape, and attain the size of from
1 m. to 5 cm. On a microscopical examina'ion of these lumps,
they showed that they consisted of two different substances
yeast cells and bacteria. The yeast cells may be regarded as
the ordinary form, produced by cuHvation, of Saccharomyces
eerevisur, but Kem was unable to get these to the spore-bearing
staje. As to the bacteria, they composed the chief part of the

little lumps, and were in the Zooglcei sta'e. The vegetative
bacteria cells were 3'2 m. to8ui. in length, and "8broad. Inpre-parations put up by drying, a distinct cell membrane could be
distinguished. Treated after Koch's method, the vegetative cells
show at one end a locomotive organ, which resembles a cat-and-
ninetails, of threads. When exposed to the action of acids or a
high temperature, the vegetative-cells grow out [probably through
progressive cell-divisions] into long Leptothrix threads, which
change generally precedes the spore-formation stage. The spores
are round, always formed in twos in each vegetable cell, and are
always placed standing on their ends; even by making use of Hart-
nack's immersionX, no parti' ion wall could be di -covered between
the spores. In the Leptothrix-threads rows of spores could be
observed, which are, however, always so situated that two
spores belong to each cell. The spores while still in the cells
are "8 m. in size; those lying free attain the size of 1 m.; the
germinating spores swell up I'6 m. The germination of the
spores generally takes place in such a manner that an exosporium
and an endosporium can always be distinguished in them. The
thinner endosporium arises out of the thicker exosporium, fir-t as
a small excrescence, which gradually increases, developing more
and more into a long cylindrical tube, and then begins by cell-

The formulae deduced by Guldberg and Waage in their general theory of action of mass have been recently applied, with satis-
factory results, by R. Warder (Amir. Chem. Journ. iii. No. 5)
to the case of saponification of ethylic acetate. W. Ostwald con-
tinues his work in the same field; he has recently studied the
actions which occur when certain pairs of salts are fused together
in equivalent quantities. His general result is that those salts
which have the greatest heats of formation are always produced in
greatest quantity. Berthelot's so-called "law of maximum work,"
viz. that of several possible products of a reaction that salt, in
the formation of which most heat is evolved, is alone produced,
is regarded by Ostwald as erroneous; if it were true, chemical
equilibrium would be established only in those exceptional

reactions wherein some of the reacting bodies underwent dis-
sociation. Berthelot's statement is a return to the old hard and
fast ideas on which "tables of affinity" were constructed, ideas
long ago overthrown by C. L. Berthollet (Journ. Pract. Chem.
xxv. I).
Data continue to be accumulated showing more definitely that
there exists a close connection between the structure of molecules
and the physical properties of the substances composed of these
molecules. Pawlewski has recently published a short account
of his researches on the "critical temperatures" of liquid com-
pounds : he states that the critical temperatures of isomeric ethers
are identical or very nearly so, that isomers containing "doubly
linked" carbon atoms have a higher critical temperature than
those in the molecule of which the carbon atoms are singly
linked, &c. [Beric/ite, xv. 460).
In an important paper bearing on the same general subject, E-
Wilson states, as a result of his collation of many determina"
tions of specific gravities of solids, that it is not justifiable to
assign, as is usually done, a certain definite volume to each
elementary atom in a compound molecule, but that the volume
to be assigned to each atom in a compound molecule depends
on the nature of all the atoms in the molecule (Proc. A'. S.,
32, 457)-

on chemical changesbefore referred to in these notes, Spring

states that he has prepared Wood's alloy (melting at 65°) by
compressing, at 7500 atmospheres, iron filings, with bismuth,
cadmium, and tin, in proper proportions. He has also obtained
Rose's alloy (lead, bismuth, and tin), and also brass, by pressure
of the constituent metals (Beriehle, 15, 595).
As the results of an extended series of observations on the
structure of metals, Kalischer (Berichtt, 15, 702) concludes that
most of the metals are naturally crystalline, and that when the
crystalline structure has been lost by mechanical treatment it
can, in most cases, be restored by the action of he.it.

of a wave of explosion. An explosion in a gaseuus compound
propagates itself, it would appear far more rapidly than a sound
wave could travel in the medium. For example, the velocity of
sound in mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases is 514 metres per
second, while the explosion propagates itself at 2814 metres per
second. M. Berthelot concludes that the wave is therefore not an

CHARLES DARWIN
I.
THE object of this notice is to give a brief account of
the life, and a proportionately still more brief ac-
count of the work, of Mr. Darwin. But while we recognise
in him perhaps the greatest genius and the most fertile
thinker, certainly the most important generaliser and
one of the few most successful observers in the whole
history of biological science, we feel that no less great, or
even greater than the wonderful intellect was the charac-
ter of the man. Therefore it is in his case particularly
and pre-eminently true that the first duty of biographers
will be to render some idea, not of what he did, but of
what he was. And this, unfortunately, is just the point
where all his biographers must necessarily fail. For
while to those favoured few who were on terms of inti-
mate friendship with him, any language by which it is
sought to portray his character must seem inadequate, to
every one else the same language must appear the result
of enthusiastic admiration, finding vent in extravagant
panegyric. Whatever is great and whatever is beautiful

in human nature found in him so luxuriant a development,
that no place or chance was left for any other growth,
and in the result we beheld a magnificence which, unless
actually realised, we should scarcely have been able to
imagine. Any attempt, therefore, to describe such a cha-
racter must be much like an attempt to describe a splendid
piece of natural scenery or a marvellous work of art ; the
thing must itself have been seen, if any description of it is
to be understood.
But without attempting to describe Mr. Darwin's cha-
racter, if we were asked to indicate the features which
stood out with most marked prominence, we should first
mention those which, from being conspicuous in his
writings, are already more or less known to all the world.
Thus, the absorbing desire to seek out truth for truth's
sake, combined with a characteristic disregard of self, led
not only to the caution, patience, and candour of his own
workwhich are proverbialand to the generous satis-
faction which he felt on finding any of his thoughts or
results independently attained by the work of others; but
also to a keen and vivid freshness of interest in every
detail of a new research, such as we have sometimes
seen approached by much younger men when the research
happens to have been their own. And indeed what we
may call this fervid youthfulness of feeling extended

through all Mr. Darwin's mind, giving, in combination
with his immense knowledge and massive sagacity, an
indescribable charm to his manner and conversation.
Animated and fond of humour, his wit was of a singularly
fascinating kind, not only because it was always brilliant
and amusing, but still more because it was always hearty
and good-natured. Indeed, he was so exquisitely refined
in his own feelings, and so almost painfully sensitive to
any display of questionable taste in others, that he could
not help showing in his humour, as in the warp and woof
of his whole nature, that in him the man of science and
the philosopher were subordinate to the gentleman. His
courteous consideration of others, also, which went far }

beyond anything that the ordinary usages of society
require, was similarly prompted by his mere spontaneous
instincts of benevolence.

of himself, made a combination as lovable as it was
venerable. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that no
man ever passed away leaving behind him a greater void
of enmity, or a depth of adoring friendship more pro-
found.
But, as we have said, it is impossible to convey in
words any adequate conception of a character which in
beauty as in grandeur can only, with all sobriety, be
called sublime. If the generations are ever to learn, with
any approach to accuracy, what Mr. Darwin was, his
biographers may best teach them by allowing this most
extraordinary man to speak for himself through the
medium of his correspondence, as well as through that
of his books; and therefore, as a small foretaste of the
complete biography which will some day appear, we
shall quote a letter in which he describes the character of
his great friend and teacher, the late Prof. Henslow, of
Cambridge. We choose this letter to quote from on
account of the singular manner in which the writer, while
describing the character of another, is unconsciously
giving a most accurate description of his own. It is of

importance also that in any biographical history of Mr
Darwin, Prof. Henslow's character should be duly consi-
dered, seeing that he exerted so great an influence upon
the expanding powers of Mr. Darwin's mind. We quote
the letter from the Rev. L. Jenyns' Memoir of the late
Prof. Henslow.
"I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon
became acquainted, through some of my brother ento-
mologists, with Prof. Henslow, for all who cared for any
branch of natural history were equally encouraged by
him. Nothing could be more simple, cordial, and unpre-
tending than the encouragement which he afforded to all
young naturalists. I soon became intimate with him, for
he had a remarkable power of making the young feel
completely at ease with him, though we were all awe-
struck with the amount of his knowledge, before I saw him,
I heard one young man sum up his attainments by simply
saying that he knew everything. When I reflect how im-
mediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older, and in
every way so immensely our superior, I think it was as
much owing to the transparent sincerity of his character
as to his kindness of heart, and perhaps even still more
to a highly remarkable absence in him of all self-con-
sciousness. We perceived at once that he never thought
of his own varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
on the subject in hand. Another charm, which must
have struck every one, was that his manner to a distin-
guished person and to the youngest student was exactly
the same: to all the same winning courtesy. He would
receive with interest the most trifling observation in any
branch of natural history, and however absurd a blunder
one might make, he pointed it out so clearly and kindly
that one left him in no way disheartened, but only deter-
mined to be more accurate the next time. So that no
man could be better formed to win the entire confidence
of the young and to encourage them in their pursuits.. . .

of natural science in the mind of Darwin. No one
can be more deeply moved by a sense of this gratitude
than was Mr. Darwin himself. His letters, written to
Mr. Henslow during his voyage round the world, over-
flow with feelings of affection, veneration, and obliga-
tion to his accomplished master and dearest friend
feelings which throughout his life he retained with un-
diminished intensity. As he used himself to say, before
he knew Prof. Henslow, the only objects of natural history
for which he cared were foxes and partridges. But
owing to the impulse which he derived from the field
excursions of the Henslow class, he became while at
Cambridge an ardent collector, especially in the region
of entomology; and we remember having heard him
observe that the first time he ever saw his own name in
print was in connection with the capture of an insect in
the fens.
During one of these excursions Prof. Henslow told him
that he had been commissioned (through Prof. Peacock)

accompanying Capt. Fitzroy as a guest on the surveying
voyage of the Beagle, and that he would strongly urge its
acceptance on him. Mr. Darwin had already formed a
desire to travel, having been stimulated thereto by reading
Humboldt's " Personal Narrative ;" so after a short hesi-
tation on the part of his father, who feared that the
voyage might " unsettle" him for the Church, the matter
was soon decided, and in December of 1831 the expedi-
tion started. During the voyage he suffered greatly from
sea-sickness, which, together with the fasting and fatigue
incidental to long excursions over-land, was probably in-
strumental in producing the dyspepsia to which, during
the remainder of his life, he was a victim. Three years
after returning from this voyage of circumnavigation, he
married, and in 1842 settled at Down in Kent. The
work which afterwards emanated from that quiet and
happy English home, which continued up to the day of
his death, and which has been more effectual than any
other in making the nineteenth century illustrious, will
form the subject of our subsequent articles.

careful discussion of the real meaning of the transforma-
tion of the Axolotl into Amblystoma. Experiments are
detailed showing that the metamorphosis may be induced
with much constancy by obliging the Axolotls, at a proper
stage of growth, to leave the water, when they lose their
gills and undergo a number of other changes constituting
a veritable metamorphosis. Dr. Weismann states that
many zoologists have expressed an opinion (which was
formerly held by himself) that this change is to be con-
sidered to be a true advance in development from a
species which had hitherto remained in the larval stage,
but which, through the influence of certain changed con-
ditions, now advances, per mlium, to a higher stage.
This view he gives many excellent reasons for considering
to be quite erroneous; holding that the facts are best
interpreted by supposing that the animal formerly under-
went metamorphosis, but that owing to changed condi-
tions it was unable to survive in the perfect state, and
therefore remained in the larval condition in which it
acquired the power of reproduction.
The causes which led to this change are believed to be
a progressive drying up of the Mexican lakes (as long
since proved by Humboldt), and a consequent increased

aridity of the atmosphere inimical to land amphibia. The
axolotl, therefore, presents us with a case of degeneration;
and its metamorphosis under changed conditions in con-
finement is not due to any advance in organisation, but
is really a reversion to a not very remote ancestral habit.
The whole of the facts at present ascertained with regard
to these animals and allied forms in their native habitats,
are shown to agree well with this view, which is quite in
harmony with the author's explanation of seasonal dimor-
phism in butterflies, given in Part I. of the same work
(see NATURE, vol. xxii. p. 141), and is also more in
accordance with the true principles of evolution than the
alternative hypothesis.
The second, and concluding essay, is entitled " On the
Mechanical Conception of Nature," and is chiefly occu-
pied with an inquiry into the true character of variation
as the chief factor in evolution, and into the comparative
importance of external conditions, and the constitution of
the organism in determining the particular direction of
the course of development; the object being to show that
all takes place accordingto fixed laws without the inter-
ference of any teleological principle, whether in the
form of a "phyletic vital force" or the interposition of
any  designing power. The writers whose views on
these subjects are combated are Von Hartmann and Karl

Ernst von Baer, and, after an elaborate and often subtle
argument, Dr. Weismann concludes that the facts can all
be explained on "mechanical" principles, or, as we should
say, by the action of fixed laws. He is however careful
to add that this does not imply a materialistic view of
nature. "Those who defend mechanical development
will not be compelled to deny a teleological power, only
they would have, with Kant, to think of the latter in the
only way in which it can be conceived, viz. as a Final
Cause." And on the great question of the nature and
origin of consciousness he thus expresses himself :" If
it is asked, however, how that which in ourselves and in
the remainder of the animal world is intellectual and
perceptive, which thinks and wills, is ascribable to a
mechanical process of developmentwhether the deve-
lopment of the mind can be conceived as resulting from
purely mechanical laws? I answer unhesitatingly in the
affirmative with the pure materialist, although I do not
agree with him as to the manner in which he derives
these phenomena from matter, since thinking and exten-
sion are heterogeneous things, and one cannot be con-

is only what it professed to be" Illustrations of the
Land and Freshwater Shells of British India." The
letterpress gives a dry list of species and synonyms, not
arranged in classified order, with occasional notes. This
is admitted by the editors, who state that they "do not
acknowledge the validity of many of these species, but
merely illustrate them." They also state their " regret
that the figures of some of the more minute shells are
not so well executed as they expected; but lithography
is scarcely compatible with sharp definition." We fully
concur in the last remark. Although this is not a review
of their work, we cannot help noticing the fact that
certain species of freshwater shells belonging to the
northern portion of British India, and which are enume-
rated in the "Conchologia India," are also natives of
Europe. Such are Limnaa auricularia and stagnalis of
Linnd, L. peregra and truncatula of Miiller, and Valvata
piscinalis of Miiller; but there is no species of Unto,
Anodonta, Spharium, or Pisidium common to the two
regions. The occurrence of the first-named five species
in countries so geographically and widely separated, may

be partly explained by these species having spread from
Siberia, which they likewise inhabit; but the mode of
their original distribution from Europe to Siberia, or vice
versd, still remains a problem. If water-fowl or other
animals had been instrumental in such distribution, why
should not any of the freshwater bivalves, which are like-
wise European and Siberian, have been similarly trans-
ported to British India?
The present work is intended to be published in parts,
of which the first has now appeared. It contains seven-
teen octavo pages of letterpress and four quarto plates.
The descriptions of new species, as regards both the shell
and soft parts or animal, have been most carefully written,
and the author has properly given the distinctive charac-
ters of each species in a correlative order, which is a point
of material assistance in comparing one species with
another. There are, nevertheless, a few exceptions to
this useful rule in species of Kaliella and Microcystina
(pages J, 12, and 13), where the umbilicus is described
first, and before the shape of the shell. The shells are
admirably drawn, although the colouring is unsatisfactory.
Without having critically studied the specimens figured,
and especially "a hatful" of them, one might, on look-
ing at the illustrations, be inclined to question the specific
distinction of several. But all naturalists are never likely
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to agree in that matter ; and perhaps it may be immaterial
whether certain forms are called species or varieties. The
minds of some naturalists have a synthetic and of others
an analytic tendency.
Col. Godwin-Austen seems to attach considerable im-
portance to the odontophore or lingual riband as an
element of classification. We believe that this affords a
good auxiliary character in defining genera or higher
groups of the Solenoconchia and Gastropoda; but the
recent investigation of the subject by Herr Friele in
respect of northern species of Buccinum shows that the
odontophore varies so greatly in individuals of the same
species that it cannot be fully relied on for distinguishing
species. Some Gastropods, e.g. Odostomia and Eulima,
have no odontophore, in consequence of their food con-
sisting of soft polyparies.
The work now noticed is a very valuable contribution
to the natural history of India, and has been intrusted to
a naturalist who is by no means less competent because
he is actuated by modest aspirations.

The Seychelles were not visited. Some noteworthy details

Modern Metrology. By Lowis D'A. Jackson. (London:
Crosby Lockwood, 1882.)
It is no easy task to give an account of the various
systems of weights and measures in use throughout the
world, to trace their origin, and to express their equi-
valents in English and French weight and measure, but this the author has undertaken in one part of his book,
and has brought together much valuable and interesting
information. This work is so far a cambist or dictionary
of weights and measures, both the scientific and commer-
cial equivalents of all foreign units being given. It would
have been well, perhaps, if the author had stated for each
country the precise authority from which he obtained his
equivalent, as works of this kind should as far as possible
contain within themselves means for verifying the accu-
racy of the figures given.
The main object of the work appears, however, to be
the discussion of a remedy for the evils of the complex
systems of weights and measures which are unfortu-
nately still in use in this country. To provide such a
remedy is a serious task, and one well worthy of the
attention of a great statesman such as Mr. Gladstone, to
whom this work is inscribed.
The author discusses the vexed question of the relative
values of standard temperatures at 32° and at 620, and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
proposes a new English system based on a cubic foot of
1000 "fluid ounces," at the temperature of the maximum
density of distilled water.
The " fluid ounce" is taken as equal to the weight of
distilled water contained in a cubical vessel whose dimen-
sions are equal to a "tithe," or tenth part of the linear
foot, when weighed and measured also at the temperature
of the maximum density of distilled water. The various
parts and multiples of the cubic-foot and "foot-weight"
would be built up by decimal progression, so that a strict
correspondence would be always maintained between
capacity, linear dimension, and weight. The effect of
reducing the temperature of the cubic foot from 620 F.
(the present legal temperature) to 39°i F. (the temperature
of the maximum density of water), would bring the weight
of the cubic foot more into accordance with modern re-
search, as it would raise its weight from 62321 lb. to
62-424 lb.

turbing the deeply-rooted systems of measures now in use
by this great commercial nation, or of substituting for

I regret that I am net able to accept the criticisms of Mr.

the effect of tidal and w ind waves on many coasts through many

of undulation and translation, and it is in no sense true that I
have confused them. With waves of undulation such as occur

in mid ocean we have nothing to do in this discussion, but it
cannot be unknown to Mr. Callaway that all such waves when
reaching a shore, become waves of translation, and more or less
powerful denuding agents. If he will have the kindness to
refer to my "Report on the Geology of Ohio," vol. i. pp. 52,
&c, he will find that I have done ample justice to the efficiency
of wind waves as agents of geological change. The great tidal
current rushing around the earth, with which he credits me,
exists only in his own imagination. I have suggested nothing of
the kind, but the rapid ebb and flow over the shores of continents
of tidal waves several hundred feet in height must necessarily act
with great violence upon such shores, and I insist that such tidal
waves as pictured by l'ruf. Ball would have left a very different
record from that we find in our Palaeozoic rocks. Some of our
American Silurian strata were deposited on shores that faced
toward the east, where they had an unbroken stretch of several
thousands of miles of ocean over which the tidal wave would
come to them without obstruction, and there the maximum effect
of such tides as Prof, ball describes would be produced, but no
traces of them are found.
1 am aware that the reef-building corals of the Devonian were
zoologically distinct from any now living, and for that reason
conditioned my inference from them; but we have satisfactory
evidence that the Devonian coral reefs of Ohio and Kentucky
were formed along a short and in a warm sea, like the reef-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
building corals of the pre cut day, and there are many reasons
for believing that their mode of life was the same.
The point made by Mr. Searles Wood in regard to the coal,
though objected to by Mr. Callaway, is well taken, for we know
that the great coal marshes of America were located just at the
sea level, and from time to time were inundated by the sea and
covered with sheets of marine limestone. It requires no argu-
ment to show that the growth of the Carboniferous forests and
the formation of beds of peatnow coalcould not have taken
place with tides rising one-half or even one-fourth of the height
of those described by Prof. Ball.
On carefully reviewing the facts which suggested my objection
to Prof. Ball's theory, I am compelled to reiterate the statement
before made, that on the east coast of North America the geo-
logical record bears positive and conclusive testimony against
the high tide theory, and that at least since the Archaean ages no
tides have swept this coast like those required by Prof. Ball's
theory, even as modified by Mr. Darwin.

The Swedish Fisheries
In Nature of April 20 you ask for an explanation of the

1. You mention that Dr. Lundberg, in the "Notizen uber die

Sweden at 5,000,000 marks (3,547,303, p. 27), but you forget
that Lundberg's book only refers to the " Ostsee und Sussvasser
Fischereien," and Dr. Dickson only speaks of the west coast or
North Sea fisheries.
2. About the "millions of barrels representing millions of
pounds sterling," the Swedish North Sea Herring Fisheries
statistics value the barrel herring now only at I to 2 shil-
lings in the first (fisherman's) hands. And you will notice
that the millions of barrels mentioned by Dr. Oscar Dickson in

¦** of civilisation at the Stone age, and using Palaeo-
lithic tools is distinctly proved in Northern Africa and
Algeria, the specimens discovered on the soil of Egypt
are not so unequivocally Palaeolithic, although those pub-
lished by Sir J. Lubbock approach the type. Of the
Neolithic stone weapons, numerous examples have been
found, some undoubtedly in use at the time of the
eleventh and twelfth dynasty, others probably descending
to the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. The indica-
tions, however, of sepulchres of the Palaeolithic period
are absolutely wanting on the soil of Egypt, and except
the stone huts in the Arabian Peninsula, belonging to the
more ancient period, there are no remains of contem-
porary construction.
In the graves around the oldest pyramids Neolithic
remains are occasionally found, and there can be no
doubt that flint weapons were extensively used at the
oldest pyramidal period, which, however, was one of copper
and bronze, copper and even iron objects having been
found in the air passages of the great Pyramid, and indi-
cations of the use of the hollow bronze drill in the stone
sarcophagi of the same epoch. The pyramids were
arranged chequer-wise in groups, and each separate site
belonged to a different dynasty, the kings and other royal
personages being inhumed in them, while around the

courtiers and officers of the court. The arrangement of
these tombs differs at the respective sites. At Sakkarah
they are arranged in rectangular groups of streets, and
the same arrangement prevails at Gizeh. At Abusir the
last undulations of the step-shaped hills which crown the
pyramids are occupied by some tombs scattered about of
the time of the fourth and fifth dynasty. At Dashour there
are also some tombs of a very early and unknown period,
and at Meidum, tombs of the third dynasty. All these
tombs bear a general resemblance to each other, and
pass by the general Arab name of mastabas," counters," or
"beds.'' At first sight they look like the pedestals of pyra-
mids, or truncated pyramids, being of rectangular shape,
with sloping sides; they are, however, not square, but rect-
angular, and the angle of the sides is so great that the walls,
if produced upwards, would rise to 600 feet, an impossible
height for such a construction. Consequently they are
not of the class of pyramids, but only show the Egyptian
preference for converging lines, instead of purely parallel

When constructed of masonry, the walls of the chapel
in the mastaba were often made of rubble revetted, and at
the end, at the foot of the false door is often found the
stone altar of libations, sometimes with two small obelisks

engraved only on one face; at other times, instead of
obelisks, two supports in the shape of altars. The stele
or sepulchral tablet was at the earliest period made in
shape of a facade, but often quite blank, a mere white
slab. It is not till after the sixth dynasty that these tomb-
stones were rounded at the top, like those of the present
day. When the chapel was ornamented, the tombstones
are often blank ; when the walls of the chapelthe asi
were unadorned, the tablets were often inscribed. In
the most ancient tombs the tombstones are often built up
of pieces and are inscribed with hieroglyphics of an early
and rude type. The art is bad, and the inscriptions are
not in regular lines, but dispersed over the area; the
hieroglyphics themselves are often peculiar, executed
with more elaborate detail than at the later period
of the middle Empire. The object of these early in-
scriptions is to record the name and titles of the
departed, and it is remarkable that at this period per-
sons had the ran da, or " great name," and the ran-nets,
or ''little name." A tomb, for example, of the second

ON SOME RECENT AMERICAN MATHEMA-
TICAL TEXT-BOOKS TN Nature (vol. xvi. p. 21) we drew attention to a
¦*¦ "shaking" that was taking place among the "dry
bones" of the mathematical text-books in common use
in American colleges and schools, and upon the analysis
we then furnished of a few works before us we ventured
to predict a speedy awakening of mathematical life. Our
prognostications have been quickly fulfilled, and we now
propose to submit an account of five recent books, some
of which are quite fitted to hold their own, in our opinion,
with English text-books on the same subjects.
"The Elements of the Integral Calculus with a Key
to the Solution of Differential Equations," by Dr. W. E.
Byerly (Boston, 1881), is a sequel to the volume on the
"Differential Calculus," previously noticed by us. This
work is founded upon Bertrand's classical treatise, sup-
plemented by free use of the allied treatises by Todhunter,
Boole, and Benjamin Peirce. The opening chapters give

a clear exposition of the use of symbols of operation and
of imaginaries. So early an introduction to these sub-
jects is novel to us in this connection, but it shows how
the subject of quaternions is coming to the front, and the
passage from the subjects of these chapters to quater-
nions is but a short one The main portion of the book
calls for no special comment. In Chapter XIV. we have
a treatment of mean value andprobability, founded upon
the able contributions of Prof. M. W. Crofton, F.R.S.,
to Mr. Williamson's treatise.
The novelty of the book is Chapter XV., entitled " Key
to the Solution of Differential Equations." This key is
based upon Boole's work, and is a collection of concise,
practical rules for the solution of these equations. An
idea of its form will be best conveyed to some persons by
saying that it resembles the analytical key so frequently
prefixed now-a-days to handbooks of the British (and
other) flora. By a series of references we run the particu-
lar equation to ground. Thus, taking the example,
(1 + x)ydx + (t - y)xdy = o, it is a single equation,
this sends us to a number; it involves ordinary deriva-
tives, this advances us a stage; it contains two vari-
ables, is of the first order, and finally of the first degree.
The upshot is we arrive at the form Xdx+ Ydy = o,
under which head we learn how to solve the equation.

Under this last head, as throughout the book, are given
numerous illustrative exercises for practice.
Dr. A. S. Hardy's "Elements of Quaternions" (Bos-
ton, 1881) is intended to meet the wants of beginners. In
addition to the works of Sir William R. Hamilton and
Prof. Tait, the author has consulted the memoirs or works
of Bellavitis (" Calcolo dei Quaternione" and the "Ex-
position de la Methode des Equipollences" in Laisant's
translation); Houel's " Quantity Complexes;" Argand's
"Essai" (1806); Laisant's "Applications me"caniques
du Calcul des Quaternions," and one or two other books
and papers in the American Journal of Mathematics, vol.
i- P- 379- It is a good introduction to such a work as
Prof. Tail's, the originality and conciseness of which,
however, Dr. Hardy thinks to be "beyond the time and
need of the beginner."
Cur next book is "An Elementary Treatise on Men-
suration," by G. B. Halsted (Boston, 1881). Dr. Halsted
is already known to mathematicians here as the author of
a very full "Bibliography of Hyper-space and non-
Euclidean Geometry," in the American Journal of

Part II. treats of relations between algebraic quantities
(functions, &c), the theory of numbers (also continued
tractions), the combinatory analysis (including proba-
bilities), series and the doctrine of limits, imaginary
quantities (operations with the imaginary unit and the
geometrical representation of imaginary quantities: note
our remarks above on this head under Byerly), the
general theory of equations.
The second of Prof. Newcomb's works before us is
"Elements of Geometry " (New York, 1881). An article
in our columns (Nature, vol. xxi. p. 293), headed "The
Fundamental Definitions and Propositions of Geometry,
with especial Reference to the ' Syllabus' of the Associa-
tion for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching,"
gives its readers a hint that some such work as the one
before us was even then in the author's mind" A sum-
mary of my own, the latter [i.e. the summary] still in an
inchoate state." The remarks in this article showed that
their writer was well fitted to address himself to the sub-
ject of a geometrical text-book, and the execution is not
at all inferior to the promise. The ground taken up is

the Euclidian geometry as comprised in the treatises of
Euclid himself, Legendre, and Chauvenet. As with the
"Algebra," here let Prof. Newcomb speak for himself.
As he himself says, the question of the best form of de-
velopment is one of great interest at the present time
among both teachers and thinkers. The object not being
to teach geometry merely, but the general training of the
powers of thought and expression being a main object,
Prof. Newcomb considers it most important to guard
against habits of loose thought and incomplete expression
to which the pupil is prone. This he considers is best
secured by teaching the subject on the old lines. The
defects he finds in Euclid's system are (1) in the treat-
ment of angular magnitude; here he makes two additions,
the explicit definition of the angle which is equal to the
sum of two right angles, and the recognition of the sum
of two right angles as itself an angle. He adopts, from
the "Syllabus," the term "straight angle," though he
himself inclined (Nature,/to. at.) to the use of "flat
angle," and considers the German "gestreckte Winkel"
to be more expressive. Then (2) the restriction of the
definition of plane figures to portions of a plane surface.
"In modern geometry figures are considered from a much
more general point of view as forms of any kind, whether
made up of points, lines, surfaces, or solids." In an

appendix, "Notes on the Fundamental Concepts of Geo-
metry" he returns to a consideration of this subject.
Features of the book are (1) the practising the student
in the analysis of geometrical relations by means of the
eye before instructing him in formal demonstrations; (2)
the application of the symmetric properties of figures in
demonstrating the fundamental theorem of parallels (cf.
German methods and Henrici's congucnt figures); (3) the
analysis of the problems of construction, to lead the pupil
to discover the construction himself by reasoning; (4) the
division of each demonstration into separate numbered
steps, and the statement of each conclusion, where
practicable, as a relation between magnitudes; (5) the
theorems for exercise have been selected with a view to
interesting the student in the study, and the author has
endeavoured to graduate them in order of difficulty; (6)
some of the first principles of conic sections have been
unfolded, more especially for the use of students who do
not propose to study analytical treatises on those curves;

the gutta-percha core and destroyed the insulation of the
cable. Means were taken to prevent this trouble, but as
passing ships did not leave a sufficient number of tele-
grams, the project was abandoned. Nevertheless, it is
clear that such a scheme is worthy of further trial ; and
even with ordinary lightships it is eminently desirable
that they should be in telegraphic communication with
the nearest Coast Guard Station. At present, guns and
rockets are the only available messengers, and when the
wind is off the shore, guns are sometimes not heard; or
when the weather is thick, rockets are not seen. The
result is, that ships are sometimes lost on shoals close by
the lightships, without the Lifeboat Station knowing it.
Carrier-pigeons have been tried, but these birds fail to
make good progress in snow-storms or thick weather, and
in heavy gales are driven hither and thither at the mercy
of the elements. The plan for cable communication
adopted by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance
Company is to moor the lightships by chains to two
mushroom anchors sunk a considerable distance apart,
tine of these chains is made double, and the cable runs

through the middle of it between the double links, as
shown in Fig. I. The chains meet at a mooring swivel,
which is made so as to allow the cable to pass through it,
as shown in Fig. 2. Between the swivel and the bow
sheave of the ship, a revolving joint in the cable/designed
by Mr. Lucas, prevents the cable becoming twisted as
the ship swings to the wind and tides. A sufficient length
of cable is coiled in a tank on board, for paying out,
when from stress of weather it is necessary to employ
more chain. A pretty model of a lightship moored on
this plan is exhibited by the Company, and on touching
a press-button let into the edge of the tank, an electric
current is sent through the communicating cable, anH
strikes a bell on board the ship. It is satisfactory to
know that the Trinity House have agreed to test the plan
by means of a cable between the Sunk lightship moored
some eight miles off the Essex coast, and the Post Office
of Walton-on-the-Naze, from whence telegrams can be
sent by day or night for any assistance required.
Of the total 97,200 miles of cable in the world, some
36,420 are owned and worked by the Eastern Telegraph
Company and its affiliated companies the Eastern Exten-
sion Telegraph Company and the South African Tele-
graph Company. The Eastern Telegraph Company i-

operations have been of great assistance to the geo-
grapher, and the soundings taken in order to ascertain
the nature of the sea-bottom, where a cable route is
projected, have enriched our charts quite as much as
special voyages. There is, however, another way in which
these operations could be made subservient to the cause
of natural science; but it is a way which has not been
sufficiently taken advantage of. Besides the specimens
of stones, mud, and sand, which the sounding-lead brings
up from the deep, the cable itself, when hauled up for
repairs, after a period of submergence, is frequently
=warming with the live inhabitants of the sea-floor
crabs, corals, snakes, molluscs, and fifty other speciesas
well as overgrown with the weeds and mosses of the
bottom. Some attempt was made to describe these
captures of the wire, as taken from the tepid seas of the
Amazon mouth, by the writer in our pages several years
ago (vol. xi. p. 329),1 and the suggestion was there made
that cable repairing might serve as a novel method of
dredging; but the hint has probably not been taken, for

A full account of this particular worm, with anatomical
illustrations, is given in the Journal of the Royal Micro-
scopical Society for October, 1881, by Dr. Charles
Stewart, secretary of the Society. The bore-holes, after
passing through the oakum of the inner sheathing, either
pursue a tortuous course along the surface of the gutta-
percha core, or go right into the copper wire, thereby
causing a "dead earth" fault Dr. Stewart classes the
worm as one of the Eunicidfe, but proposes for it the
generic name of Lithognatha worslei, because of its pos-
sessing a pair of calcareous mandibles or cutting jaws,
and after Capt. Worsley, the Commander of the repairing
ship which picked up the worm-eaten cable. The pair of
calcareous jaws, in addition to three pairs of chitinous
ones, is the most remarkable feature about the animal,
and the white plates which form them make the creature
look as if it were in the act of swallowing a tiny bivalve
shell.
The best protection hitherto formed against it is to
cover the core with a ribbon of sheet-brass, laid on with-
out a lap. First the gutta-percha is covered with cloth,

then the brass is overlaid. Canvas is then put over the
brass, and the hemp and iron wires over all. A close layer
of iron wires is not a sufficient protection, for the worm
can sometimes wriggle in between the wires where they
are not close enough; and, moreover, the rapid decay of
iron wires in tropical seas is certain to leave the core a
prey to these pests in a few years.
The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company also ex-
hibit some interesting samples of stones picked up from
the sea-bottom; for example, limestone blocks and shells
bored by the bivalve, Saxicava ragosa, the worm
Sabella, and the sponge Hymeniacidon celata; wood
honeycombed by the teredo, a red stone pitted by the
bivalve shell (pholas), and a ferruginous flaky stone
brought up from the bottom between Penang and Singa-
pore. Most interesting, however, of these inanimate
waifs is a flat piece of black flinty rock hollowed into cuplike pits by the sucking feet of the sea-hedgehog. The
pits are excavated as lairs for the animal and some of
them are nearly three inches in diameter by one inch
deep. To make the rocky bed softer to the feel, the
hedgehog has lined it with a calcareous enamel, probably
secreted by its body, much in the same way as the pearl
oyster coats its shell.
In the earlier days of submarine telegraphy, Sir
William Thomson declared the life of a cable to

be practically inviolable; and Robert Stephenson, on the
other hand, was of opinion that no cable would last out
ten years. The latter view has proved the more cor-
rect, for the average life of a cable hitherto has been
about eleven years. Thanks to the improved means of
repairing them, however, the outbreak of faults does not
mean the loss of a cable, for these flaws can be cut out in
water, however deep, and the cable put to rights again.
Indeed every cable company expects a recurrence of
faults, and provides a fully-equipped repairing ship always
on the spot. A fine model of such a ship is exhibited by
the Po ,t Office, after the designs of Mr. R. S. Culley.
Messrs. Johnson and Phillips also exhibit a variety of
buoys and grapnels for cable operations. The ordinary
grapnel is liable to have its prongs broken off in dragging
over a rocky bottom, as may be seen from one exhibited
which had every prong bent back among the coral reefs
of the Brazilian coast. Centipede grapnels are therefore
fitted with removable prongs; and Mr. A. Jamieson has
invented a grapnel with spring teeth which bend back

wire is attached to two copper wires, the lower parts of
which, or those most distant from the platinum, are well
varnished; these are fixed erect in a glass of distilled
water, and another cylindrical glass closed at the upper
end is inverted over them, so that its open mouth rests

on the bottom of the former glass; the projecting ends
of the copper wires are connected with a voltaic battery
(two or three pairs of the nitric acid combination), and
the ignited wire now gives a steady light, which continues
without any alteration or inconvenience as long as the
battery continues constant, the length of time being of
course dependent upon the quantity of the electrolyte in
the battery cells. Instead of making the wires pass
through water, they may be fixed to metallic cups well-
luted to the necks of a glass globe.
The spirals of the helix should be as nearly approxi-
mated as possible, as each aids by its heat that of its
neighbour, or rather diminishes the cooling effect of the
gaseous atmosphere; the wire should not be too fine, as
it would not then become fully ignited; nor too large, as
it would not offer sufficient resistance, and would consume
too rapidly the battery constituents ; for the same reason,
i.e. increased resistance, it should be as long as the
battery is capable of igniting to a full incandescence."

ments on the illumination power of this contrivance
under different conditions.

this, at mid-height in the sun's atmosphere, we got indi-
cations about which there could be no mistakewe were
in presence of hydrogen: incandescent hydrogen, be it
observed, which plays as important, or indeed a still more
important part in the solar air than nitrogen does in our
own. Next it was imagined that close to the sun itself
there was a vaporous sea containing all the other sub-
stances which had been detected by the spectroscope
magnesium, calcium, iron, barium, cobalt, nickel, and
some twenty other bodies termed "elements" by the
chemist, because he cannot reduce them to a condition of
greater simplicity. As the sum total of these inquiries,
then, we had some such idea of the sun's atmosphere as
this: Physically it was incandescent, of enormous extent,
very irregular in outline, its extent and outline varying
almost every time it could be observed. Chemically it
was built up of substances known to terrestrial chemis-
try ; it was very simple at top, and very complicated at
bottom. This mental image was the joint product of
both laboratory and eclipse work. The solar spectrum
that is, the beautiful rainbow ribbon which is produced

when light from the sun is made to pass through a prism
enabled us even in our laboratories, without a telescope,
to study the chemistry of the sun's atmosphere as a whole,
but such work as this localised nothing. Further, the outer
atmosphere is so dim as compared with the intensely
brilli 1 t interior nucleus, that it, like the stars in the day-
tinii, m put out, and remains invisible so long as the sun
itself is in a position to illuminate our upper air. In this
we have the use of total eclipses, for at such times the
moon prevents the sunlight from falling on our atmo-
sphere, and the sun's atmosphere shines out in all its
weird splendour, as the stars show themselves when the
light of day is withdrawn. It is fair to add, that there is
a method which enables us to study the chemistry and even the meteorology of the very brightest portion of the sun's atmosphere, called the chromosphere, without wait-
ing for an eclipse, but still, every allowance being made,
it should be now clear that to study the physical attributes
of the atmosphere as a whole, we are strictly limited to
total eclipses. So much, then, for our brief expose. There
is still some more ground to be gone over before the
question with which we set out is answered. What was the
sum total of the work done during the last eclipsethat
observed in the United States in 1878, with a wealth of
instrumental appliances such as had never been used
before? How did it deal with our received notions?
Did it endorse them or demolish them?
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
It certainly endorsed them in the main, while it enabled
us to accumulate a vast amount of new knowledge on
many important points, and showed us how every effort
should be made to secure these precious records. Among
other things, it intensified the difference between eclipse
and eclipse, for the spectroscopic record of the outer
coronaas the exterior atmosphere is sometimes called
differed very considerably from the one secured in
1871, and it was a noteworthy fact that the eclipse of
1871 happened when there were most spots on the sun,
while that of 1878 took place when there were fewest. I
said " in the main." But during the eclipse one observa-
tion was made, which in the light of former laboratory
work suggested that after all there was a rift in the lute,
and that our view of the solar economy might be much
more wrong than we had any idea of. Since 1878 that
same laboratory work has been continued, and a long
series of observations of the spectra of sun-spots has been
made, and the tendency of all this extra eclipse-work has
all been in one direction. We are now face to face with
the idea that, in the hottest part of the sun, the tempera-

the total eclipse of 1878duly chronicled in the Daily
News at the timewas one by which Prof. Newcomb
demonstrated a tremendous extension of the corona in
the direction of the plane of the sun's equator, or very
near it. It will be important to see, whether on the pre-
sent occasion the extension will be so great, especially
since Dr. Siemens has thrown down the gauntlet to astro-
nomers by his bold speculations touching the circulation
of the solar gases. Such, then, are some of the things
which the Eclipse Expedition is going to do, or going to

The subjects of the first instalment were the genera
Caulerpa and Zonaria, and the classification and de-

Sargassum.
The present work consists of essays on the Chor-

work by Dr. Agardh in the classification of some of the
plants of the olive series of Algae.
Beginning with Elachistea, as the author, restoring
the old spelling, prefers to call it, we find that this genus
is removed to the CHORDARiEyE. This is in accordance
with the views of Dr. W. H. Harvey, expressed in the
"Phyc. Brit. Tit." E.fucicola. This genus is especially
interesting from the" fact that out of the nine species,
seven are British. E. velutina (of the "Phyc. Brit." pi.
xxviii. B), removed by Thuret to Streblonema, is placed
by Dr. Agardh in his new genus Herponema (see p. 55).
The next genus, Myriocladia, includes M. Loveni, an
extremely rare species, which has been obtained grow-
ing on oysters in deep water in the Baltic, and which Dr.
Agardh ("Sp. Alg.", p. 53) states was found by the late
Mr. Borrer on the Sussex coast; it has not, however,

This week we give the first of a short series of articles on the
life and work of the late Mr. Darwin. The series is under the
general care of Dr. G. J. Romanes, F.R.S., who also will take
special charge of the Zoology and Psychology. The Geology
will be by Prof. Geikie, F.R.S., Director of the Geological
Survey, and the Botany by Mr. W. T. Thiselton Dyer, F.R.S.

At a meeting of Convocation of the University of London
held May 9, the following resolution was unanimously passed :
"The Graduates of the University of London, in Convocation
assembled, desire to record their sense of the irreparable loss
which science and philosophy have sustained in the death of Mr.
Darwin, whom they recognise as an acute and patient investi-
gator, an earnest seeker after truth, and an original thinker,
whose discoveries have exercised a profound influence upon
scientific research and upon the progress of scientific thought
throughout the world."
A novel feature at the meeting of Convocation of London
University, last week, was the appearance for the first time of
female graduates in academical costume. Sir George Jesse!,
who presided, gave some statistics to show the rapid progress in
the numbers availing themselves of the University's examina-
tions, while Sir John Lubbock pointed out the progress that had
been made in scientific education during the past year, referring
especially to the City Technical Institute. "What is wanted,"
he said, "is not so much money or men, as method and organi-
sation, and to utilise the resources we already possess." He

referred to the wasted resources of Gresham College, which, he
said, ought to be "placed on a footing more in accordan-e than
it has been with the wise designs of its noble founder." It was
agreed to request the Senate to take definite steps with regard to
this fossilised institution.
A well-deserved baronetcy has been conferred upon the
eminent scientific agriculturist, Dr. John Bennet Lawes, F.R.S.
The vast services rendered to agriculture by Sir John B. Lawes,
in connection with Dr. Gilbert, are well-known. The new
baronet, we learn from the Times, was born in 1814, and suc-
ceeded to his estate at Rothamstad, in Hertfordshire, in 1822.
Mr. Lawes was educated at Eton and at Brasenose College,
Oxford, where he remained from 1832 to 1835. During his
academic career he displayed at once a strong partiality for the
laboratory, and on leaving the University, spent some time in
London, for the purpose of studying in a practical manner the
science of chemistry. Possessed of independent means, a hand-
some property, and a beautiful old nanor-house and demesne,
Mr. Lawes at once interested himself in agriculture. In Octo
ber, 1834, he first commenced regular experiments in agricultural
chemistry on taking possession of his property and home at

A satisfactory Report for 1881 has been issued by Mr.
Paton, curator of the Kelvingrove Mu.-eum, Glasgow. The
natural history collections especially have greatly increased
during the past year, and if displayed properly, would themselves
fill the Museum. It seems strange that so wealthy a city as
Glasgow should be content to have iheir growing and valuable
museum so inadequately housed.
Dr. P. A. Bergsma has resigned his appointment as Director
of the Batavia Observatory, and is returning to Europe. We

We regret to learn of the deatb, at the early age of thirty-two, of a promising young science teacher and lecturer, Mr. Thomas
Dunman, lecturer on Physiology at the Birkbeck Institution, and
Physical Science Lecturer at the Working Men's College. His

by energy, perseverance, and a strong faith in one's own powers.
Mr. Dunman has done excellent work in science teaching at both
of the institutions mentioned. In 1879 he published a glossary
of "Biological, Anatomical, and Physiological Terms," and
finding his Lectures on Popular Scientific Subjects were so much
appreciated, he commenced last year to issue them in pamphlet
form.
Messrs. Bailliere, Tindall, and Cox have the following
announcements :A revised and enlarged edition of Harris and
Power's "Manual for the Physiological Laboratory" will appear

national Medical and Scientific Congress of 1881 is in course of
preparation, with a few additional portraits; a second part of
the President of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons'
(Mr. Fleming) work on "Animal Plagues," from the beginning
of the present century, will be published during the next few

Maj' 18, 1882] fs/'A T(/RE 69
vol. xv. lart 3, p. 360) "On the Knowledge of Distance given
by Binocular Vision," in which he elaborated the idea that the
apparent position of the combined image produced by rays, from
a pair of conjugate pictures, upon corresponding retinal points
of the two eyes, is determined by the intersection of visual lines
passing through conjugate points. He deduced a formula and
constructed a table of apparent distances, thus determined, for
various values of the angle of convergence between the visual
lines.
In 1849 Brewster described his invention of the lenticular
stereoscopc (P/nil. /llag. 1852, p. 16) and of the binocular
camera, by which slightly dissimilar pictures of the same object
may be simultaneously obtained for examination in the stereo-
scope. Various modifications of the instruments already in use
were explained, and in all of them the apparent position of the
combined image was referred to the point of convergence of the
visual lines, these being determined by the direction of rays on
entering the eyes after reflection or refraction in the stereoscope.
In |852 Wheatstone published a second paper (PML Ilhig.
1852, p. 504) on the Physiology of Vision, in which he discussed
the effects of varying the angle of convergence between the
visual lines, and also the distance of the pictures from the
mirrors of the reflecting stereoscope. He males no reference to

divergence of visual lines, but, like Brewster, he snbjoins a
table of the inclinations of the optic axes, which correspond to
the different distances," which is also applicable to the binocular
camera.
In direct binocular vision of a single point in front thc inter~
ocular line is the base of an isosceles triangle, whose two sides
are the visual lines. Helmholtz (Optique Physiologique,"
p. 93) has shown that the latter are not coincident with the optic
axes, but practically they may be regarded as axial in relation tn
the crystalline lens. For distinction it will be convenient to call
them visual axes, their intersection the optic vertex, and the
angle inclosed the optic angle, as has been customary.

\\'beatstone notices the exaggeration of perspective produced
uhen Il pair of conjugate pictures, taken with a large angle
bctu een the camera axes, are viewed in the stereoscope with the
visual axes nearly or quite parallel. He mentions, as a remark-
able peculiarity (Phil. Mag. 1852, p. 514), that "although the
optic axes are parallel, or nearly so, the image does not appear

to be referred to the distance we should from this circumstance
suppose it to be, but it is perceived to be much nearer. It
seems as if the dissimilarity of the projections, corresponding as
they do to a nearer distance than that which would be suggested
by the former circumstance alone, alters in some degree the
perception of distance." The last explanation is obviously inapplicable if two perfectly
similar pictures can be binocularly seen as one, \vith parallelism
or divergence of vi~ual axis. This condition is easily imposed
by placing before one eye a thin prism with its edge outward.
A single object in front is seen double until the visual axis
diverges enough to make the two images coincide in retinal posi-
tion. To test the strength of the external rectus muscles of the
eye-balls, this method has now been in use for many years by
oculists. The same effect may be attained by drawing a pair of
conjugate pictures apart until binocular fusion of their images
ceases to be possible. Divergence of visual axes, to the extent
of 8, hits been thus obtained by Helmholtz (Opt. l°hys., p.
616), and of 7§' by the present writer. Since this point of
meeting is, in these cases, in the rear of the observer, the theory
of binocular prospective held by Wheatstone and Brewster is
incorrect. It is nevertheless given without qualification, either

with the optic vertex, and to the distance of this the local
adjustment is adapted.
Let a = optic angle, varied by means of the stereoscope.
,, 0' = optic angle of normal vision for given distance.
 D = distance of optic vertex from each eye, determined
by the formula, D = J i cosec Ja.
,, D' = distance of radial point measured in the direction
from which the reflected ray enters the eye. It is
hence the distance of the vir ual image in normal
vision.
 A = distance of point of sight from binocular eye.
Under the conditions given above we have
a - a', and A = D = D'. Assume D' = 50 cm., then o' = 70 20'.
If now we make « = 37' 20', we have D = iocoi. But to
secure distinct vision, the focal adjustment must be adapted to
D', and therefore dissociated from the axial adjustment. This
to some extent antagonises the effect of tension of the internal
rectus inu-cles, and this antagonism is increased by the fact that
the visual angle remains constant. The combined effect is that
A>D but A<D'. The apparent size of the image is dimin-
ished in ihe ratio of A to D'. The effect of increasing the
          Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
optic an^le is hence to make the image appear nearer, smaller,
and less deep in proportion to its area, but more disnnt never-
theless than the new optic vertex.
If now we makea= -5°, we have D = -73'4cm., but the
relaxation of the internal rectus and contraction of the external
rectus mu-cles causes the ima^e to appear to recede in a positive
direction. This illusion is opposed by the constancy of the
visual angle, and the ciliary effort to keep the focal adjustment
adapted to D'. The result is that A>D', and the apparent size
of the image is enlarged in the same ratio, while its depth is
increased still more. The effect of making the optic angle
negative is hence to cause the image to appear farther, larger,
and deeper in proportion to its area.
If in the discussion just given we make a the angle between a
pair of camera axes, and D the distance of its vertex, while i is
the distance between the two lenses, the formula is readily
applicable, but a can have only positive values. The optic angle
for the observer while using the stereoscope is not necessarily, or
even generally, the same as that between the camera axes when
the picture "as taken. Apparent distance in the stereoscope is
thus not determined by the intersection of the observer's visual
lines, and no mathematical formula can be made to apply to the
interpretation of muscular tension in the muscles of the eyes.
The error into which Wheatstone fell, and which was repeated
and emphasised by Brewster, consists in the application of

geometry whtre physiological conditions are such as to des'roy
the value of all geometric constructions. Unfortunately this
error is still repeated in most of our text-books of physics,
wherever diagrams are employed to explain the theory of the
stereoscope. W. Le Conte Stevens

the end of the mercury column, whilst the other lens focussed
the tube, so that no alteration of the focus of the micro cope
was necessary in making an observation. Dr. Brown also found
that a constant zero temperature was better obtained from a
mixture of ice and water than from drained ice; and that it was
preferable to mix the ice with distilled water rather than ordinary
water. Acting on the suggestion of Dr. Guthrie, Dr. Whipple,
of Kew, had found that the ice itself might be from different
sources without appreciably affecting the result. Dr. Whipple
called attention to the change of zero in thermometers by heat-

sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and such like, produced no effect on

carbon and the amount and composition of the ash showed that
this structuieless substance is most nearly allied to wood. Mr.
JJaumann, consequently, looked for cellulo-e in the wall of the

wood. The specific gravity was found to be 1*36, »>. greater

CHARLES DARWIN''
II.
^T O man of his time has exercised upon the science of
"i Geology a profounder influence than Charles Darwin.
At an early period he took much interest in geological
studies, and all through life, while engaged in other pur-
suits, he kept himself acquainted with the progress that
was being made in this department of natural know-
ledge. His influence upon it has been twofold. It arises
partly from the importance and originality of some of his
own contributions to the literature of the science, but
chiefly from the bearing of his work on other branches of
natural history.
When he began to direct his attention to geological
inquiry the sway of the Cataclysmal school of geology was
still paramount. But already the Uniformitarians were
gathering strength and, before many years were past, had
ranged themselves under the banner of their great cham-
pion Lyell. Darwin, who always recognised his indebted-
ness to Lyell's teaching, gave a powerful impulse to its
general reception by the way in which he gathered from
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
all parts of the world facts in its support. He continually
sought in the phenomena of the present time the explana-
tion of those of the past. Yet he was all the while laying
the foundation on which the later or Evolutional school
of geology has been built up.
Darwin's specially geological memoirs are not numer-
ous, nor have they been of the same epoch-making kind
as his biological researches. But every one of them
bears the stamp of his marvellous acuteness in observa-
tion, his sagacity in grouping scattered facts, and his
unrivalled far-reaching vision that commanded all their
mutual bearings, as well as their place in the general
economy of things. His long travels in the Beagle
afforded him opportunities of making himself acquainted
with geological phenomena of the most varied kinds.
With the exception of one or two minor papers written
in later years, it may be said that all his direct contribu-
tions to geology arose out of the Beagle voyage. The
largest and most important part of his geological work
dealt with the hypogene forces of naturethose that are
concerned in volcanoes and earthquakes, in the elevation
of mountains and continents, in the subsidence of vast
areas of the sea-bottom, and in the crumpling, foliation,
and cleavage of the rocks of the earth's crust. His re-
searches in these subjects were mainly embodied in the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"Geology of the Voyage of the Beagle'"a work which,
in three successive parts, was published under the
auspices of the Lords of the Treasury.
The order chosen by Darwin for the subjects of these
three parts probably indicates the relative importance
with which they were regarded by himself. The first
was entitled "The Structure and Distribution of Coral
Reefs" (1842). This well-known treatise, the most
original of all its author's geological memoirs, has be-
come one of the recognised classics of geological literature.
The origin of those remarkable rings of coral-rock in
mid-ocean had given rise to much speculation, but no

satisfactory solution of the problem had been proposed.
After visiting many of them, and examining also coral-
reefs fringing islands and continents, he offered a theory
which for simplicity and grandeur strikes every reader with
astonishment. It is pleasant after the lapse of many
years to recall the delight with which one first read the
"Coral Reefs," how one watched the facts being mar-

America; while a third, on the geology of the Falkland
Islands, was published later.
While dealing with the subterranean agents in geolo-
logical change, he kept at the same time an ever watchful
eye upon the superficial operations by which the surface
of the globe is modified. He is one of the earliest writers
to recognise the magnitude of the denudation to which
even recent geological accumulations have been sub-
jected. One of the most impressive lessons to be learnt
from his account of Volcanic Islands is the prodigious
extent to which they have been denuded. As just stated
he was disposed to attribute more of this work to the
action of the sea than most geologists would now admit;
but he lived himself to modify his original views, and on
this subject his latest utterances are quite abreast of the
time. It is interesting to note that one of his early geo-
logical papers was on the Formation of Mould (1840), and
that after the lapse of forty years he returned to this sub-
ject, devoting to it the last of his volumes. In the first
sketch we see the patient observation and shrewdness of
inference so eminently characteristic of the writer, and in
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
the finished work (so recently noticed in these columns)
the snme faculties enriched with the experience of a long
and busy life. In bringing to light the operations of the
earthworm, he called the attention of geologists to an
agency, the real efficiency of which they probably do not
yet appreciate. Elie de Beaumont looked upon the layer
of grass-covered soil as a permanent datum-line from
which the denudation of exposed surfaces might be mea-
sured. But, as Darwin showed, the constant transference
of soil from beneath to the surface, and the consequent
exposure of the materials so transferred to be dried and
blown away by wind, or to be washed to lower levels by
rain, must tend slowly but certainly to lower the level
even of undisturbed grass-covered land.
To another of his early papers reference may be made
from its interest in the history of British geology. Buck-
land, following in the footsteps of Agassiz, had initiated
that prodigious amount of literature which has now been
devoted to the records of the Glacial period in this
country, by reading to the Geological Society a paper
"On Diluvio-glacial Phenomena in Snowdonia and in
Adjacent Parts of North Wales" (1841). Darwin,
whose wanderings in South America had led him to
reflect deeply upon the problems presented by erratic
blocks, took an early opportunity of visiting the Welsh

district described by Buckland, and at once declared
himself to be a believer in the former presence of glaciers
in Britain. His paper C1843) 'n which this belief is stated
and enforced by additional observations, stands almost at
the top of the long list of English contributions to the
history of the Ice Age.
The influence exercised upon the progress of geology
by Darwin's researches in other than geological fields, is
less eTS< to be appraised. Yet it has been far more wide-
spread and profound than that of his direct geological
work. Even as far back as the time of the voyage of the
Beagle, he had been led to reflect deeply on some "of
Lyell's - '-culations upon the influence of geological
chan«e=n the geographical distribution of animals.
From t1 t time the intimate connection between geo-
1 -tory and biological progress seems to have been
continually present in his mind. It was not, however,
until the appearance of the " Origin of Species" in 1859
that the full import of his reflections was perceived. His
chapter on the "Imperfection of the Geological Record"
startled geologists as from a profound slumber. It would

ancient types might be found lingering in protected and
isolated situations. "We can understand how it is that
all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together
one grand system ; for all are connected by generation.
From the continued tendency to divergence, the more
ancient a form, is the more generally it differs from those
now living. The inhabitants of each successive period in
the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the
race for life, and are in so far, higher in the scale of
nature; and this may account for that vague, yet ill-
defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that
organisation on the whole has progressed. If it should
hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a
certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the
same class, this fact will be intelligible."
Again, what a flood of fresh light was poured upon
geological inquiry by the two chapters on Geographical
Distribution in the "Origin of Species!" A new field
of research, or, at least, one in which comparatively little
had been yet attempted, was there opened out. The
grouping of living organisms over the globe was now seen

to have the most momentous geological bearings. Every
species of plant and animal must have had a geological
history, and might be made to tell its story of the changes
of land and sea.
In fine, the spirit of Mr. Darwin's teaching may be
traced all through the literature of science, even in de-
partments which he never himself entered. No branch
of research has benefited more from the infusion of
this spiiit than geology. Time-honoured prejudices have
been broken down, theories that seemed the most surely
based have been reconsidered, and, when found unten-
able, have been boldly discarded. That the Present must
be taken as a guide to the Past, has been more fearlessly
asserted than ever. And yet it has been recognised that
the present differs widely from the past, that there has
been a progress everywhere, that Evolution and not Uni-
formitarianism has been the law by which geological
history has been governed. For the impetus with which
these views have been advanced in every civilised country,
we look up with reverence to the loved and immortal
name of Charles Darwin.

THE records of science and philosophy during the
past few years have been especially fertile in indi-
cations of a desire to place the relations of these two
departments of inquiry upon a better footing than that of
their former history. The desire has its source not in a
spirit of concession but in a consciousness of necessity.
A deeper criticism of conceptions with which in scientific
investigation it is not possible to dispense, has brought
several of its chief apostles face to face with fundamental
obscurities and even contradictions which seem to cast
doubt upon the validity of these conceptions. On the
other hand philosophy has of late been coming into ex-
tensive contact with results obtained by scientific methods
and has been compelled either to modify its position, or
go to the wall. The result is that attention has been
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:08 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
increasingly directed to that critical examination of the
nature of human knowledge, which claims on its negative
side to have finally destroyed the old metaphysics and
assigned definite limits to investigation, on its positive
side to have exhibited these limits as arising out of the
ultimate constitution of mind. The translation, just pub-
lished, of the " Kritik der reinen Vernunft," is one of the
latest contributions to the literature of this subject. The
cry of "Back to Kant" which has of late years been
heard so frequently in this country and abroad, has been
responded to by Prof. Max Miiller with two well-appointed
volumes. Of these the first contains the translator's
preface, an "Historical Introduction" by Prof. Noire-,
and a translation of those passages of the second edition
of the "Kritik," which differ from the corresponding
passages in the first. The second volume consists of the
translation of the first edition. The merits of the intro-
ductions and translations will be best estimated after the
considerationas far as the compass of a review will
allowof Kant's position.
To understand the critical philosophy, it is essential to
realise that its problem and subject-matter are entirely
different from any thing that is or can be dealt with by
science in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and in
particular from the investigations of physiological or

otl.er psychology. Science deals with what it is customary
1:1 our aspect to call mind, and in another cerebral
organisation, and inquires into the relations of this to the
surrounding environment. It seeks to lay bare the
mechanism of perception and ideation, and to exhibit the
complete dependence of mental upon cerebral functions.
And of late years it has pretty well justified its title to the
exclusive occupation of the field as against the old intro-
spective psychology. Mind and its environment are alike
the objects of and given in what may be indifferently
spoken of as knowledge, consciousness, or experience.
That is to say, they presuppose knowledge (to use the
-ppellation which is perhaps least encumbered with
question-begging associations) as that through which, like
everything else, they exist, and in which the meaning of
existence is to be found. The old Berkeleian reduction
of esse to percipi is matter of common knowledge, and the
leaders of scientific thought show a very proper disposition
to treat it as a truism. For the statement that the uni-
verse in ultimate analysis is reducible to a succession ot
states or groups of states of consciousness, amounts to no

thought, which was -always subject and never object in
knowledge, of which it was wrong to predicate existence,
because it was above the categories of existence in that
only as its object could things be said to be. For Kant,
such an intellectual activity was something very different
from that "unknowable" of which so much has been
written. Of the "unknowable" it may be said, that
although it exists, is a cause and so forth, it can never be
intelligible to a finite mind, but it is none the less the
object as distinguished from the subject of thought.
 Kant's (as the time went) great knowledge of physical
science no doubt contributed to cause him to revolt
keenly against Hume's apotheosis of the individual self.
He had anticipated, and to a surprising degree grasped,
the modern conception of evolution. He had worked out,
independently of Laplace, the mechanical theory of the
solar system, and had enunciated the hypothesis of de-
velopment in the organised world. For him there was
no possibility of supernatural interference, and Man
was but the last link in a gradually evolved chain of life.
He could not assent to conclusions which assigned to an

individual consciousnessitself but a point in the bound-
less immensity of space and timethe position of being
the foundation of the whole phenomenal universe, and
which regarded knowledge as a fiction. He saw clearly
enough that the problem was not an ordinary scientific pro-
(blem of relations within experience, but the problem as to
the constitution ofexperier.ee itself. In science (as indeed
in metaphysics) we are always concerning ourselves with
some conceivable object of knowledge, and we assume that
there is no question about the conditions of that experience
in which that object is actually or conceivably included
as a part. But Kant's problem was that of knowledge
itself, with the relations of space, time, causality, &c,
which enter into its constitution, and which, as the condi-
tions of the possibility of objects of knowledge could
bear themselves, are implied in such objects. His
method was that which is the general method of inductive
reasoning, to apply an hypothesis to certain data, and to
modify it, as appeared necessary from the result of the
test of adequacy to the explanation of these data. His
findings were in outline these: Berkeley and Hume
showed that things cannot create thought, or exist other-
wise or in any other sense than for thought. Therefore
thought must create things. But we find an inexhaustible
material in nature which cannot be understood as the pro-

duct of thoughtthe matter of perception as distinguished
from the formal relations which are found to be exclusively
the work of thought in knowledge; this formless matter
Kant declares to become the object of knowledgethat is
to attain realityin so far as it is brought under two
pure a priori forms, which belong exclusively to mind,
space, and time. But in the constitution of the real
there is something more implied, for space and time,
tiken by themselves, are merely the formal possibilities of
spatial and temporal arrangement. Kant now shows
that the matter of perceptionthe raw material of sensa-
tion of which all we can say is that it is wholly meaning-
less and without reality, excepting as thought makes it
otherwiseis determined in the two pure forms of per-
ception in the fundamental relations which he terms
"categories," and which include not only quantity,
quality, substance, cause and effect, &c, but every other
relation of experience. ' The main difficulty in under-
standing Kant arises from the tendency to forget that the
process of creation, which has just been in outline indi-
cated, is not a process taking place in space and time.

for examplethe characteristic of which may roughly be
said to be that the whole determines its partsis a spe-
cies of relation which is unreal, in that it cannot be
represented as a fact in space and time. For qui space
and time what we call and must think of as an organised
whole, is merely a mechanical aggregate of parts which
are external to, and independent of each other. Yet the
knowledge of nature implies that the conceptions of
organisation are real in the sense that experience suggests
and forces them upon us, and without them nature would
not only seem quite different from what it is, but could
not be a connected whole at all. In other words, while
an aggregate of purely mechanical relations is logically
conceivable, such an aggregate would necessarily be quite
different from the universe as known to us. The recog-
nition of nature as beautiful and as organised is essential
to its existence as nature, and these aspects cannot be got
rid of although they are not real in the sense that the
mechanical aspects are real. There are thus different
phases in, or kinds of knowledge, all arising out of the
ultimate constitution of intelligence. This result carries

with it the solution for Kant of a number of difficulties.
To ask, for example, how that which is organised springs
out of an environment which is not organised, is to mis-
take a problem of knowledge for a problem of the relation
of the objects of knowledge. For there is no line of
demarcation which separates the organism from its en.
vironment. We speak as if there were such a line, be-
cause, for the purposes of advancing the limited know-
ledge of the individuals (which, because it is conditioned
by space and time, cannot comprehend the whole uni-
verse sub specie aternitatis), it is convenient to abstract
now from one sort of relations, now from another, and to
talk of things as if they presented the aspects only of
mechanism, or only of organisation. Kant declared that
the twofold aspect was everywhere potentially present,
because of the twofold operation of thought in the consti-
tution of things.
Whether Kant was right in his conclusion that there
were different kinds of knowledge, or w hether he ought not
to have taught that there were rather different stages than
kinds, this is no place to inquire. When the systems of
the late German philosophical writers have been stripped
of what is at the same time most prominent and most useless in them, it will be found that they contain much
valuable and detailed suggestion upon this point. It
may be that Kant's theory of knowledge is imperfect, and

that his distinctions are in many cases artificial and un-
warrantable. But his criticism forms the basis of a new
departure in investigation, and it cannot be understood
without being to a great extent assented to. Not the
least of his achievements is that he has sifted to their
foundation and placed in a new light such metaphysical
abstractions of science as matter, cause, organisation and
mind, and has shown why and in what sense they give
rise to problems which appear insoluble. His method
was intrinsically the same as that of science generally,
and to him belongs the credit of having brought science
and philosophy into a definite connection. Those who
have best followed his teaching have most clearly under-
stood that the future of philosophy is to be looked for,
not in a slavish adhesion to Kant's or any other system,
but in the detailed application of his principles, to the
critical investigation of the methods of particular branches
of empirical inquiry. Already the effect of such an appli-
cation has been shown in the new conception of history
which has resulted from it, and there are indications that

insects (mostly in great detail) feeding on particular trees,
such as oak, elm, hickory, willow, pine, &c, &c, without
special reference, in the first instance, to the particular
specks of these trees. This is a good plan, for it is only
occasionally that certain insects are attached particularly
to certain species in a genus of trees : these are specially
indicated under the larger headings. We have often
found ourselves in a dilemma in attempting a notice of
these American reports, and this condition is strikingly
in force with regard to this one in particular. Almost
without deception, they are sound and lasting additions
to the scientific literature of entomology ; this one is
especially so. But then there is the economic side of the

question to be considered, and that is the most difficult.
Naturally every insect that is attached to a particular
species of plant, by feeding upon it, may in a certain
sense be said to be "injurious" to that plant. Thus, in
this present Report, under "Willow" we find even the
"Camberwell Beauty" (Vanessa antiopd) included in the
list of enemies ; but we are quite sure that no one (not
even the author) seriously imagines that it (with myriads
of other species mentioned) is an " injurious insect" from
an economic point of view. Certain insects feed on cer-
tain plants, and will eat no other; if the plant is exter-
minated, the insect disappears, and to keep up the balance
of nature, it is quite possible that if the insect were exter-
minated in the first instance, some more destructive enemy
(or disease) might eventually attack the plant. But the
greater part of the eneiries to trees commit their ravages
by attacking the wood or bark, and here especially we
think economic entomologists keep too much in the back-
ground the fact that many insects (and many of those
here under consideration) act mainly the role of scavengers.
Undoubtedly a leaf-feeder often attacks the most healthy
trtes, and as a rule it only becomes really injurious
when present in extraordinary numbers; but with regard
to what may be termed lignivorous insects, we strongly
incline to refuse to see in the insect itself (in the

condition; on the contrary we regard it as only

unconnected with its presence. Cur author, apparently
unconsciously, virtually acknowledges this in his sug-
gestions of remedies with regard to a beetle infesting
the spruce (p. 277), and also elsewhere, by recommend-
ing, above all, preventive measures, these consisting in
destroying all dead and dying trees, in which the insects
especially abound. An unhealthy condition of the tree
is the most favourable for the development of t'le beetle;
but we are not of those who suppose a prescience in
the latter which induces it to attack healthy trees for the
benefit of prospectively remote generations of its descen-
dants.
We wish Dr. Packard had not gone out of his way

Dr. Siemens' Solar Hypothesis
I HAVE been vailing for several weeks for answers to the
following rather obvious objections to Dr. Siemens'Solar Hypo-
thesis, but I have not seen them either asked by others or
answered by Dr. Siemens.
1. How the interplanetary gases near the sun acquire a suffi-
cient radial velocity to prevent their becoming a dense atmosphere
round him?

attached to the planets, notably to the moon?
3. Why the earth has not long ago been deluged when a con-
stant stream of aqueous vapour that would produce a rain of
more than 30 inches per annum all over the earth must annually
pass out past the earth in order to supply fuel to be dissociated
by the heat that annually passes the earth?
4. Why we can see the stars although most of the solar radia-
tions are absorbed within some reasonable distance of the sun?
Geo. Fras. FitzGeralp

I have the pleasure to reply to the very pertinent questions
put by Prof. FitzGerald as follows :
1. The gases being for the most part hydrogen and hydrogen
compounds have a low specific gravity as compared with the
denser ga-es forming the permanent solar atmosphere. On
flashing into flame in the photo-phere, their specific gravity would
be vastly diminished, thus giving rise to a certain rebound action
which coupled with their acquired onward motion, and with the
centrifugal impulse they receive by frictional contact with the
lower atmosphere, constitutes them a surface stream flowing from
the polar to the equatorial regions, and thence out into space.
(Lest I should be misunderstood, allow me to add that I do not
look upon centrifugal action as sufficing in any way to overcome
solar gravitation.) Astronomers are in the habit of regarding
each spheroid possessed of an atmo phere as rotating in vacuous
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
space; under such circumstances the atmosphere must partake
of the rotatory moti in of the solid spheroid, and after having
attained an increased depth at the equator, will assume a state
of static equilibrium unless disturbed by external influences. No
such statical equilibrium is pos ible, however, if we assume the
same spheroid with its atmosphere, surrounded by an ocean of
indefinite dimensions, consisting of ga-eous matter not partaking
of the rotation of the spheroid, although subject to its attractive
influence. Lqual masses will under those conditions be equally
attracted both in the polar and eqmtorial direction, and the con-
tinued disturbance of equilibrium by rotatory motion must result
in continuous outflow. Nor need this outflow be accomplished
entirely at the expense of rotato-y motion of the spheroid because
the inflowing polar current when once established, will only have
to be changed in direction by frictional action in order to convert
it into the outflowing current.
2. Regarding the second question, I assume that the atmo-
sphere of each spheroid in S'-ace is precisely such as would
result from its mass, and if this view is correct, the moon also
must have an atmosphere, though of so attenuated a character as
to be scarcely perceptible by means of optical instruments; for

fall iu extensive landslips down the sides. These landslips or
rockslips are so numerous, that in fine weather they are most
conspicuous objects on the sides of the hills, and look like dry
water courses. One of these rockslips I witnessed at Cape
Grafton, from a distance of three miles. The noise was terrific,
and the ground trembled as though from an earthquake. On
examining the blocks of granite which had slipped to the bottom
of the ravine, I found many of them with their sides grooved
and scratched, and one fragment was as beautifully polished on
one side as if it came from the hands of a lapidary, excepting,
of course, the scratches and grooves. In the course of a few
cen'uries, much of the range will be worn away, and its sides
represented by an alluvial deposit mainly consisting of angular
boulders of every size and shape, many of which will be
polished, scratched, and grooved. There are very few geolo-
fogists who would not call it a glacial drift, even now, were not
the cause so evidently before them. Will this help to explain
tho e so-called drifts, which, like this instance, are found far
within the tropics? T. E. Tenison-Woods

THE ECLIPSE EXPEDITION

On the Nile, between Siout and Sohag, May 6
The astronomers have now nearly reached their des-
tination if all goes well, but it is by no means certain that
everything will, for the Nile has never been known to
be so low, and wc have already been aground many times.
To-morrow morning will see them and their instruments landed after their last water journey. The arrangements
made by the Egyptian Government and by His Highness
the Khedive himself, who takes the liveliest personal
interest in the work, have bsen simply perfect. Every- ithing seems to have been foreseen, every possible cause
of delay obviated, and everything that could conduce in any way either to the comfort of the observers or the suc-

cess of the observations provided. One officer of the Egyptian Government or another has been in constant
attendance upon the expedition since they landed at Suez,
and any indication of a desire that a certain course of action should be taken has been at once attended to.
There is no shutting one's eyes to the fact, that there are
many men occupying high positions in this wonderful
country, through which we are now journeying, who take
the keenest interest in scientific progress, and who are
more than anxious, that Egypt should take her place
among the more highly civilised nations, among whom
science is cultivated to a greater or less extent; and there
can be little doubt, that the efforts now being made to
educate the people will in time bear more fruit of this
soil. It is quite apropos to this train of thought to men-
tion, that the fact that the admirably equipped observatory
of Cairo will count for very little among the proposed
observations is keenly felt. It must not, however, be
imagined that because the metropolitan observatory
counts for so little, Egypt possesses no astronomers. I
mentioned in a former letter that it was hoped that Ismatt
Effendi, a member of the Khedive's household, might be
attached to the expedition. When the expedition reached
Suez and the Kaisar-i-Hind steamed into the harbour, it
was easy to see that something unusual was going on
there. The Khedive had not only sent Ismatt Effendi to
receive the expedition, but had sent orders to the Governor
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of Suez to welcome it in his name. Nor was this all. A
special train had been provided for the instruments and
observers, and every precaution taken for safe handling
and safe custody of the former. In the morning the
Governor of Suez speeded the parting guests, who were
accompanied by M. Ismatt, and this gentleman soon
showed how much he had profited by the long training
he has received in the observatories of Paris and Wash-
ington, and it was soon acknowledged that in him the
expedition not only found a most useful and agreeable
co npanion, but a collaborator of the highest value.
Un arrival at Cairo the party found General Stone,
chief of the staff, accompanied by Moktah Bey, on the
platform to welcome them. Of the former, it may be
that his influence for good on the higher education in
and on the officers who have served under him is
knowledged. He has lost none of the enthusiastic

in Egypt has been extraordinary. There has been much
rain and very little khamseen, and now there is a brisk
north wind blowing, which generally follows the dust
wind. Hence many weather-wise people say that the
khamseen is over; if so, of course, all the better. On
the other hand, to-night from our sandbank we have wit-
nessed a sunset rendered transcendentally beautiful by
clouds over fully one-half of the sky. It is possible
therefore that if the present weather continues, the sky
will not be quite so free from vapour as it is generally in
Upper Egypt. To avoid the khamseen, General Stone,
who has had the region reconnoitred, has suggested to
the English party to occupy an eminence to the north-
west of Akmin, a village a little higher up the river than
Sohag.
Near Sohag, Sunday
I had got so far at 11 last night, when the time came
for closing the mail bag, although we were fast aground,
and apparently with less chance than ever of getting off.
There were two mail bags, however, made up after all,

that I am still in time on Sunday evening to send a letter
which ought to catch the next Brindisi mail, though
whether it does or nor is very doubtful, for we have been
aground again twice to-day.
So, as we have at last arrived at our station, I will
endeavour to give an idea of the proposed arrangements.
In the first place, we have found the steamer on which
the various parties are to live as the guests of the Khedive
moored close to the shore, at a point where it trends north
and south, or very nearly so, about half a mile below
Sohag. This position, which has been selected by the
French partythe first to arriveis a very admirable one
for two reasons. First, the constant wind during the last
week has been from the north, and by keeping a staff of
people watering the foreshore of the Nile, all dust is ob-
viated. To the north of the place of observation trees,
and what looks like grass from a distance, grow close to
the margin of the river; so that the dust can only be of
nearly local origin; while a long stretch of sandbank to
the north, running east and west, is far enough away to
deposit its sand in the Nile before it can reach us.
Secondly, the khamseen, if khamseen there is to be,
will have to travel a mile and a half along the Nile before
it can enter the observatories; and it is thought this
amount of water surface will have an important effect in
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
reducing the amount of sand in the air, even in its case
also. Nous verrons. These considerations have induced
the English party to take up ground close to the boat and
their French confreres. The hills which look so tempting
in the mass are simply impossible as places of observa-
tion. With the means at command here it would take a
week to get the instruments up, much more in position;
while at Akmim, which is only two or three miles away,
there does not seem to be any spot more favourable,
taking everything into consideration, than the one here.
At five o'clock to-morrow, then, the work will begin,
and the next week will be a busy one, for in spite of the
fresh breeze and the cloudsfor there are very distinct
clouds to-daywork on the sand becomes very oppressive
in the middle of the day, and there are heavy weights to
move, which the observers must move themselves. The
scene from the ship is already interesting. To the north
two tents and various shelters, to the south one tent.
These «ill increase to six to-morrow. Here and there
groups, looking down the bank, stealthily from between
the trees. There is a pretty thick grove of acacia trees,

1879 Col. Rykatchoff, of the St. Petersburg Central Phy-
sical Observatory, established, on board the Nayezdnik.
an anemometer of his own construction, which was ob-
served during the ocean cruise of the clipper; and the
schooner Nordcnskjold, which unhappily was lost in 1879
at Yesso Island, had also an anemometer, which was
taken afterwards on board the Russian clipper Djighit
by M. Domojirov. The observations on board of the
Djighit werecarried on with this anemometer (of Casella)
put in such an apparatus (like that of the lamps on board
of ships), as always maintained it in a vertical position,
even during the heaviest seas, when the ship oscillated
for 30° on one side, and 35° on the other. The apparatus
was put on a 16-foot-long pole, which was pushed out for
each observation on the wind-side of the ship, from the
boat, and thus exposed to the full force of the wind for
ten minutes. The height of the instrument above the sea
was 26 feet. The direction of wind was determinated by
means of a vane, and its true direction computed from
the apparent one, on the principle of the parallelogram of
forces, by taking into account the velocity of the ship.

When the angle between the direction of the wind and the
direction in which the ship goes is known, as well as the
seeming velocity of wind (measured by the anemometer),
and the velocity of the ship, the true velocity of wind is
easily determined by means of simple computations, or of
the tables published for that purpose by M. Rykatchoff
(Russian Marine Review, February, 1880). A series of
experiments having been made for ascertaining in how
far the calculated figures agree with the true ones, M.
Domojirov arrives at the conclusion that these figures
are quite reliable; determination having been made
during the progress of the ship, she was immediately
stopped, and the determination made anew, both results
always being quite identical. But the measurements
from the side-boat are very tedious and even dangerous
during heavy seas, and each observation occupies no less
than three men for about twenty minutes. Therefore M.
Domojirov proposes to apply electricity to register the
rate of the anemometer.
The observations on board the Djighit were made five
and six times per day from March 23 to May 30, and the
complete results, with all elements for calculations, are
published in the papers of M. Domojirov. The north-
eastern trade-wind, observed on the passage from Japan
to the Sandwich Islands and back, had a very regular
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
force of from 5 to 9 metres per second; the south-eastern
trade-wind experienced on the passage from the Sunda
Islands to the Seyschels, had a velocity of 4 to 9 metres
per second, and the south-western winds on the passage
from Port Victoria to Aden, had velocities from 12 to 15
metres per second.
It would hardly be necessary to insist on the importance
of such observations for meteorology, as well as for prac-
tical purposes, and we hope that soon the still prevailing
prejudices as to the possibility of anemometrical observa-
tions on board ships having disappeared, and more con-
venient methods of observation having been devised, the
anemometer will become on board ships as necessary an
instrument as the log and barometer. P. K.

rear of the instrument. It will be noted that during the
instant of exposure, the sensitised surface is steady, and
when the exposure is over, it is at once passed away.
Pressure on the button (b, Fig. 2, 1) sets the machine in
motion. Before applying this instrument to the study of
the flight of birds, an experiment was made with it on a
black arrow, made to rotate against a white back ground
well lit up. The speed of the rotation of the arrow was
about 5 metres a second. The marksman, at a distance
of 10 metres sighted on the centre of the target, on
which the eye could perceive nothing save a confused
grey shadow, so quick was the rotation of the arrow: but
on the development being completed, twelve images were
to be seen, disposed in a circular manner, and each showed
not only the arrow, but its shadow, as sharp as if the
original had been immovable. Another experiment,
equally successful, was made on a pendulum beating
seconds. For to be more certain as to the duration of the
exposure, M. Marey next adapted to the gun a chrono-

the taking of each picture could be with precision ascer-
tained. After all these preliminary essays, the photo-
graphy of animals in movement was attempted; and in
Fig. 3 there will be seen the photographic representations of
a sea-gull, in which the twelve successive attitudes assumed
during the space of a single second by this bird during
flight are ascertained. On other occasions other success-
FlG. 5.Sea-gull; end of depression of wing.
ful photographic series of a sea-gull in flight were taken
when the bird was seen less in profile. The sea-gull gave
exactly three strokes of its wing each second, so in the
twelve photographs of each stroke four succeeding stages
were reproduced. The wings at first elevated to their
greatest, then commence to be lowered ; then in the follow-
ing image they are seen at the lowest point of their course;
and in the fourth image are again on the rise. In enlarg-
ing these images, figures seen from a good distance were
obtainable, but the sharpness of the enlargements left a
good deal to be desired ; for the negatives were somewhat
granular, no doubt owing to some slight fault in the
photographic process. The reproduction of these images
by the heliographic process gives excellent silhouettes (as
seen in Figs. 4 and 5) ; the originals, when examined
under the microiope, showed even the wing-feathers
distinctly.

On comparing the indi rations thus given by the photo-
graphic process with those already attained by the graphic
process, a confirmation o' most of the principal points
obtained by the latter were obtained; but otherwise so
far, the latter did not seem to add much to our knowledge
of the mechanism of flying. However, ere deciding that
this is so, numerous observations 01 different birds flying
and in different conditions of flight, during calms and
storms, and with and against the wind, must be taken.
Attempts were also made to photograph the bat, but its
its flight during the dusk, and its capricious
lying made it a difficult subject; but some of
vperiments revealed interesting results. The angle
of oscillation of its wings is very extended, especially from
below, when the two wings form two vertical planes
sensibly parallel.
These extremely interesting researches of M. Marey are
only, as it were, in their infancy; he intends pursuing
them much further, and his results will be looked for
with great interest by all those who study the subject ot
animal motion.

of each distinct species. But if two species, both equally
distasteful, closely resemble each other, then the number
of individuals sacrificed is divided between them in the
proportion of the square of their respective numbers; so
that if one species (a) is twice as numerous as the other (b),
then b will only lose one-fourth as many individuals as it
would do if it were quite unlike a; and if it is only
one tenth as numerous then it will benefit in the propor-
tion of 100 to 1. It is an undoubted fact that the species
of protected butterflies, like those of other groups differ
greatly in abundance of individuals, some being very rare
while others are among the commonest of all butterflies.
The proportion of ico to 1, therefore, is far below the
amount of benefit an uncommon species might derive by
resembling a common one. The benefit to be derived is
thus clear, if the protected species are subject to the
danger of attacks by young birds before they learn that
such species are uneatable. I agree with Dr. Miiller that
they are exposed to this danger; and when we consider
the great number and variety of insectivorous birds in
South America the danger must be considerable, and

quite sufficient to render it important for a numerically
weak species to reduce it to a minimum, although to a
species abounding in individuals it may be of litile im-
portance. It has been suggested that young birds have
an hereditary instinct enabling them to distinguish uneat-
able butterflies antecedent to experience; but this seems
in the highest degree improbable. It has no doubt been
shown by Mr. Darwin that monkevs in captivity have a
dread of snakes, and Mr. Jenner Weir believes that birds
have an instinctive knowledge of uneatable caterpillars.
But even admitting that in these two cases there is an
instinctive hereditary aversion, it does not follow that the
same will occur with regard to protected butterflies.
Snakes form one well-marked group, and it is not alleged
that monkevs distinguish between poisonous and harmless
snakes; and caterpillirs can also be readily divided into
the two classes of edible and inedible by their green or
brown (protective) colours on the one hand, and their
gaudy or conspicuous colouration or hairy bodies on the
other. But the protected butterflies have no such general
mark of inedibility. Their colours and forms vary greatly,
and cannot as a group be readily differentiated from those
of other butterflies; and it is not to be accepted without
actual proof that a young bird knows instinctively every
Heliconoid or Danacoid butterfly in its district, as well

as the protected Papilios and moths, almost infinitely
varied as they are in colour and marking, among the
equally numerous and equally varied butterflies of other
groups It therefore seems clear to me that we have
here a vera causa for the acquisition of true protective
mimicry by the less abundant species of inedible
butterflies.
There is however yet another cause which may have
led to mimicry in these cases, and one which does not
appear to have been discussed by Dr. Miiller. The fact
that the majority of butterflies are edible and are actually
eaten by birds and other insectivorous creatures, while a
considerable minority are distasteful and are thus pro-
tected, renders it pretty certain, a priori, that there exist
many degrees of distastefulness. Certain species appear
to be rejected by all insectivorous creatures, while some,
though not eaten by birds, may be devoured by lizards,
dragon-flies, or spiders. Some, too, may be eaten by
some birds and rejected by others, and no ornithologist
will think it strange or improbable that a trogon should
have somewhat different tastes from a tyrant-shrike or a

Mis first publication of importance was entitled "Grundziige
tiner allgemeinen Photometrie des Himmels" (1861), and in
1S65 followed the work, which must be considered his principal
o ie, "Photometrische Untersuchungen mit besonderer Riicksicht
auf die physische Beschaffenheit der Himmelskorper" (Leipzig,
Lngelmann). The photometer constructed by Zollner compares
the light of the celestial object observed with an artificial star
produced by a constant source of light (the flame of a paraffin
lamp kept at a constant height), which can be varied at will by
turning two of the three Nicols through which the light from
the flame has to pass. A crystal plate allows of variation of
cjlour. With this instrument Zollner observed both the moon,
the principal planets, and the fixed stars, and the last chapter of
his "Untersuchungen " contains an interesting attempt to explain
all the various phenomena of variable stars, sun-spots, &c, by
the gradual cooling of all the celestial bodies. In several late;
papers in the Proceedings (Berichte) of the Saxon Society of
Sciences these ideas are further developed, particularly with
respect to the nature and periodicity of sun-spots. Without
knowing it Zollner here followed in the footsteps of Buffon.
Zollner next directed his attention to spectrum analysis, and on

February 6, 1869, he read a paper before the Saxon Society on
a method of observing the solar prominences in full sunlight;
but Zollner did not obtain a suitable instrument for carrying out
his idea till some months later. His "Reversionsspektroskop '
which produces two spectra side by side and in opposite direc.
ions, has been utilised by himself and others for determining
the rate of rotation of the sun by the shifting of the spectral lines
at the opposite limbs. Most of his spectroscopic researches
relate, however, to the solar prominences. In 1871 Zollner
published a paper on the nature of comets in the Leipzig Btrichtel
and the following year he republished this paper together with
two papers by Olbers and Bessel, and a number of chapters "On
the Theory of Comprehension " in his well-known book, "Ueber
die Natur der Cometen," which excited much comment at the
time, and made him many enemies. About the same time a
new chair of "Physikalische Astronomie " was founded at the
Leipzig University, to which Zollner (who had for some years
been extraordinary professor) was appointed. His astrophysical
activity was at that time at its height, but soon after he turned
his attention to spiritualism, which seems to have absorbed all
his energy of late years.

came out of the water a little way during the night, and, attack-
ing several of the new-born perfect insects which had not yet
begun to fly, voraciously devoured them. This singular practice
(it is suggested) may explain why one finds such a small number
of ALschna cyanea, in comparison w ith the number of nymphs.
In raising the larva; and nymphs of the dragon-flies, the best
food, according to Signor Stefanelli, is meat, and especially

known that the nebula in Orion was discovered by Cysat in 1618,

and his discovery is mentioned in his "Mathemeta Astronomica

de Cometi Anni, 1618"; Bessel refers to-it in his investigation
of the elements of the great comet of this year, in the Berliner
Jahrbuch for i8d8. Cysat does not distinctly mention the
number of stars, but clearly indicates their locality. Hnygh ;ns,
in the "Systema Saturnium," 1659, describes his own discovery
of the nebula, and refers to "three stars close together," which
are shown in an accompanying figure. He saw the fourth star,
completing what is now known as the trapezium of Orion on
January 8, 1684, and Prof. Holden record, that the last obser-
vation made by Huyghens was upon this system, on February 4,
1694, and the sketch in his manuscript journal under that date
gives the four stars. In Hoove's "Micrographia," published in
1665, is a note (to which the attent on of the American astro-
nomer was drawn by Mr. H. B. Wheatley), which would imply
that he was aware of the existence of the fourth star (notified by
Cassini in his treatise on the comet of 1652), and of the fifth
star, the discovery of which is usually attributed to VV. Struve.
He writes: "In that notable asterism also of the sword of Orion
where the ingenious Monsieur Hugens van Zulichem has disco-
vered only three little stars in a cluster, I have, with a 36-foot
glass, without any aperture [diaphram] (the breadth of the glass
being some three inches and a half), discovered five, and the
twinkling of divers others up and down in divers parts of that
small milky cloud." Sir John Herschel, in the Mtmoirs of the
Royal Astronomical Society, vol. iii. mentions that Sir James South had pointed out to him in the original M.S. journals of

the Royal Society a note which runs thus: "September7, 1664
Mr. Hooke . . . the same relateth to have found those stars in
Orion's belt, which M. de Zulichem maketh but three to be
five." Prof. Holden made some special experiments in January,
1878, with the 26-inch refractor at Washington, the aperture
reduced to 3.J inches, and arrived at the conclusion that if the
fifth star were of the same brightness in 1664 as at this time, it
would not have been discovered by Hooke ; but, on the contrary,
Mr. Burnham has brought together a number of cases in which
'he fifth star has been seen recently with such an aperture. The
sit'h star was detected by Sir John Herschel in 1830. Of other
vars, suspecte 1 by several observers, Prof. Holden, during six
years' observations of the nebula surrounding the trapezium, has
not discovered any trace.

FOOD-PLANT IMPROVEMENT >
'"THE food question may be divided into two parts. I. lis
¦*¦ production (raw material). 2. Its preparation when pro-
duced. It is my intention to consider the first part onlyfood
production. This, again, seems naturally to divide itself into:
I. Plant-food. 2. Animal food. And again, I propose to
speak mainly of the first alone, alluding only incidentally to
animal-food, upon which I will commence by making what
remarks I have to make in order to clear the ground for the
consideration of //an/-food, the subject upon which I have been
invited to address you. The improvement effected in the pro-
duction of animal-food by the careful breeding or long repeated
selection of sheep, cattle, and swine is so well known as to
render it quite unnecessary to occupy much of our time in its
consideration; I will only adduce one or two striking illustra-
tions to show the kind of change which has been thereby accom-
plished. There is very strong ground for believing that the
celebrated improved breed of shorthorn cattle is descended from
a race originally black. Now black seems to have been in the
eyes of all the best breeders of it a colour to be got rid of or
wiped out, and this most certainly has been effected, for no
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
single instance of it is now to be found. The improvement in
the outward form of the animals has been carried almost to the
breeders' ideal of perfection. These are external changes.
Early in the history of shorthorns the breeders in Vorkshire
made the production of milk their chief point, while those in
Durham saved for breeding purposes the progeny of those cows
only which showed the greatest tendency to lay on meat, and
the result is the "Improved Durham," the pride and glory of
the modern cattle show, but which are very poor milkers; while
the "York" shorthorn is synonymous with a cow specially
productive of milk. These are internal changes effected in
anim lis by selection. When we turn to plants what do we find?
The first thing, aud which is apparent to everyone, is that each
produces "fruit after its kind. But close observation shows
something more than this, viz. that, although each produces
"after i's kind," no two plants of any kind are absolutely alike.
I speak not of mon>trositie-, of which the characteristics are not
heritable, but of that ever present tendency throughout nature to
variation, of which the hoiticulturist has availed him.elf. These
variations, of which we can 1 ro t through the great principle of
inheritance are generally slight, so much s >, indeed, as to be

largest ear produced 113 grains. The greatest number of ears
on one 'stool' was 72." And next I give the last report received
of the same wheat, from New Zealand, published in the Otago
Daily limes of June 3, 1881 :"We have been shown two
samples of wheat grown by Mr. M. C. OrbeE, at Waikouaitai,
and we do not remember to have seen any to compare with them
in this country. They are known as Hallett's Pedigree wheat,
Hunter's White, and Original Red. The yield exceeded any-
thing ever grown in the district befoie. Mr. Orbell sowed IJ
bushels upon one acre, and the yield was 72 bushels (or nine
quarters) of good marketable wheat. Many of the plants con-
sisted of over 90 ears, some of which contained as many as
132 grains each. Hallett's Pedigree white Canadian oats, intro-
duced by the same importers, have, we understand, been culti-
vated by Mr. Shannan, of Conical Hills Station, with the same
success as the wheat grown by Mr. Orbell." Thus, after 18
years (not without further selection, but the selection, having
been continued annually at Brighton throughout the interval), the
same wheat is found not only to have maintained, but to have
further developed its vigour of growth, producing over "90"
ears (instead of 72 ears) upon a plant, with 132 grains (instead

of 113) in an ear. In England, 1876, 105 ears on a plant con-
tained more than 8coo grains. (The average number of grains
in an ordinary ear is 22 only.) From Essex in the same year as
the date of the report first given, a crop of the same wheat
was reported of 27 quarters on three acres, or nine quarters per
acre, exactly the same quantity as that just given as obtained
eighteen years later in New Zealand I Can illustration further go
that there is no deterioration if only the selection be continued?
Here is another exp rience in another year and country :M.
Tiehonnais, editor of La Revue Agricolc tie tAugleterte, writes
October 9, 1865, from Brussieres, France"lam now staying
here, a large farm where your wheat is extensively cultivated.
The average this last harvest was at the rate of seven quarters to
the English acre; the average of the other sorts in the same
district did not exceed three quarters per acre."
Thus far as to vigour of growth and productiveness. I will
now give examples of the other two points named, hardiness and
quality. Report of the Minister of the Interior, Belgium: "I
continue to sow the varieties of wheat improved by Hallett,
above all the 'Red,'and 'Victoria' white. These varieties are
very hardy. During the winter 1875 and 1876 many of our
varieties of wheat have been destroyed by frost. The Hallett
Red has successfully withstood the frost. It has been the same
with the Victoria. On the other hand, the variety 'Galand' has been completely destroyed, not a single plant of it left. We
have seen many fields of even our 'little red ' variety, very hardy,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which have greatly suffered." Lastly, as an example of sustained
quality, a report from Linlithgow, Scotland, dated November
23, 1878: "I have again, making now ten years in succession,
had the honour of topping the Edinburgh market with your
Hunter's white wheat. I sent some of your barley to Australia,
and in a few years it spread and gave immense satisfaction."
The pedigree cereals having been grown in upwards of forty
different countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Aus-
tralasia, it is, of course, impossible to give, in such a paper as
this, any idea of how widely extended has been the success of
selection as exemplified in them, but I may mention that, in
acknowledgement of that success, the Minister of Agriculture at
St. Petersburg placed at my disposal the collection of all the
agricultural colleges of Russia; and the Minister for Hungary
sent through the Austrian Embassy at Vienna, and published, a
most flattering communication showing results obtained by his
Government by adopting my system. From Italy, Holland,

only in the North-West Provinces and Upper India, but in the
far more favoured cotton fields of our Presidency, is an adequate
testing and full authentication of some inexpensive method of
treatment or cultivation, which shall be equally applicable to the
exotic, hybridi ed, and good indigenous varieties, and which the
ryots themselves will be able to appreciate alike under their
present simple methods of tillage, or under any improved system
they may eventually be induced to adopt. There is at last, we
think, some prospect of this desideratum being attained. The
minute of his Excellency suggests more than simply a systematic
method of operation in future experiments. It describes what is
known at home as Ha//r/t'.r p.'digr¢¢° ry:/rr/1, which consists in the
selection by hand of the finest seed from each successive year's
crop, and the annual reproduction of the plant only from such
seed; and it enjoins the adoption of this plan in experiments
both with exotic and indigenous cotton, as the best means of
acclimatising the one and improving the other. The advantage of
this system appears so very manifest that the wonder seems to
be that it has never yet been tried. A cultivator selecting the
finest bolls in his field of cotton, and putting them aside, extracting from them at leisure the seed for his next sowing, is a thing
that has never yet been heard of; but the matter is so simple, so
reasonable, that we have little doubt that the system will be
generally adopted when the ryots come to be acquainted with it,

and its advantages are explained to them. The same article
then goes on to say : The pedigree system was begun last year
in different parts of the Presidency, but cannot be said to have
yet had to any appreciable extent a trial, as it is obvious that the
effect of it can only be judged by the character of the produce of successive years. In the experiments now being conducted in
accordance with the plan suggested by His Excellency, there is
yet another element of success in the efficient character of the
agency employed. The Cotton Departments are assisted in the
work by four practical horticulturists, Messrs. Shearer, Stormont,
Strachan, and Milne, who have been sent out to this country for
the purpose by the Secretary of State, who, we believe, selected
them from a number of applicants on the recommendation of
Dr. Hooker, of the Botanical Gardens at Kew. I wrote to my
friend Sir Joseph Hooker, who, in reply, says the men were sent
out from Kew in 1869, but that he has no statement of the results
beyond a newspaper cutting, stating that their services were
highly approved of, adding, "cotton is coming down from the
country much better in quality and in much larger quantities." I
therefore wrote tothe lndia Ofiice requesting to be furnished
with a copy of the Minute above referred to, and with informa-
ti in as to the exact plan adopted and the results obtained. I
can only suppose that there is some difficulty in doing this, as,
although I stated that these particulars were required for the
Congress this day, they have not yet reached me.

my system, done me the honour to consult me upon it, I should
have pointed out that mere horticulturists, however skilful,
would not (unaided) be likely to accomplish very much. It
appears that in India there are thirty different kinds of cotton
grown, in as many separated districts, for the Liverpool market.
In each district the kind of cotton grown there is said to be that
most suitable, and indeed the only kind that can be cultivated
there with advantage. If this be so, then there must be thirty
~electors -one in each districtin order to improve to the utmost
the cotton most suitable to it. I do not profess any special
knowledge of the growth of cotton, but I know something of
the growth of wool, and I apprehend that fineness, and length
and strength of fibre are qualities equally desirable in both. I
have seen a buyer of wool, when blindfolded, tell by the touch
the age and sex of the animal from which the fleece in his hand
came, and I have tested beyond all possibility of doubt his
ability to do this. I am told there are men in Liverpool who
have an equal gift in judging cotton, but that such men soon
ti-altc their fortunes there. But these are exactly the men who
are wanted for cotton selectors in India. The available differ-

and steadily pursuing the same plan year by year, by selecting
from all their crops, and again selecting from that selection, will
be able apparently, if the present results may be relied on, to
increase the production and fruitfulness of the plant, and in the
course of a few seasons to establish a veritable 'Tedigree Cotton,'
as unlike its parent as the 'English thorough-bred,' with his long stride and fine skin, is unlike the stock whence he originally
sprang. It remains for me to notice the avidity with which our
surplus seed was purchased by the cultivators. Mr. Wilkinson

and that the crop produced was an abundant one. He further
adds, 'I was informed by the Patel of one of the villages that
this seed had given great satisfaction ; yields being reported of
96 lbs. to 150lbs. cotton per acre, according to the amount of
care in cultivation.' This gives an average of 123lbs., but I
will only take 100 lbs. as the average product, and even then I
find the figures loudly speaking in favour of carefully picked
and selected seed.

continuousat the end of this stage about j the alumina

THE influence which our great naturalist has exerted
upon zoology is unquestionably greater than that
which has been exerted by pmy other individual; and as
it depends on his generalisations much more than upon
his particular researches, we may best do justice to it by
taking a broad view of the effects of Darwinism on
zoology, rather than by detailing those numberless facts
which have been added to the science by the ever vigilant
observations of Darwin. Nevertheless, we may begin
our survey by enumerating the more important results of
his purely zoological work, not so much because these
have been rarely equalled by the work of any other zoolo-
gist, as because we may thus give due prominence to the
remarkable association of qualities which was presented
by Mr. Darwin's mind. This association of qualities was
such that he was able fully to appreciate and successfully
to cultivate every department and ramification of biologi-
cal researchwhether morphological, physiological,syste-
matic, descriptive, or statisticaland at the same time to

rise above the minutia of these various branches, to take
those commanding views of the whole range of nature
and of natural knowledge which have produced so enor-
mous a change upon our means of inquiry and our modes
of thought. No labourer in the field of science has ever
plodded more patiently through masses of small detail;
no master-mind on the highest elevation of philosophy
has ever grasped more world-transforming truth.
Taking the purely Zoological work in historical order)
we have first to consider the observations made during
the voyage of the Beagle. These, however, are much too
numerous and minute to admit of being here detailed.
Among the most curious are those relating to the scissor-
beak bird, niata cattle, aeronaut spiders, upland geese,
sense of sight and smell in vultures"; and among the most
important are those relating to the geographical distribu-
tion of species. The results obtained on the latter head
are of peculiar interest^inasmuch as it was owing to them
that Mr. Darwin was first led to entertain the idea of
evolution. As displaying the dawn of this idea in his
mind we may quote a passage or two from his " Voyage
of a Naturalist," where these observations relating to
distribution are given :
"These mountains (the Andes) have existed as a great
barrier since the present races of animals have appeared,

and therefore, unless we suppose the same species to have
been created in two different places, we ought not to
expect any closer similarity between the organic beings
on the opposite sides of the Andes, than on the opposite
shores of the ocean."
"The natural history of these islands (of the Galapagos
Archipelago) is eminently curious, and well deserves
attention. Most of the organic productions are Aboriginal
creations, found nowhere else; there is even a difference
between the inhabitants of the different islands; yet all
show a marked relationship with those of America, though
separated from that continent by an open space of ocean,
between 500 and 600 miles in width. The archipelago is
a little world within itself, or rather a satellite attached

this article do not admit of our giving a summary of these
results, so we shall only allude to the one which is most
important. This is the discovery of the " Complemental
Males." The manner in which this discovery was made
in its entirety is of interest, as showing the importance of
remembering apparently insignificant observations which
may happen to be incidentally made during the progress
of a research. For Mr. Darwin writes:
"When first dissecting Scalpellum vulgare, I was sur-
prised at the almost constant presence of one or more
very minute parasites, on the margins of both scuta, close
to the umbones. I carelessly dissected one or two speci-
mens, and concluded that they belonged to some new
class or order amongst the articulata, but did not at the
time even conjecture that they were cirripeds. Many
months afterwards, when I had seen in Ibla tint an
hermaphrodite could have a complemental male, I remem-
bered that I had been surprised at the small size of the
vesiculae seminales in the hermaphrodite 5. vulgare, so
that I resolved to look with care at these parasites; on
doing so I now discovered that they were Cirripedes, for
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
I found that they adhered b^ cement, and were furnished
with prehensile antenna;, which latter, I observed with
astonishment, agreed in every minute character, and in
size, with those of -S". vulgare. I also found that these
parasites were destitute of a mouth and stomach; that
consequently they were short-lived, but that they reached
maturity; and that all were males. Subsequently five
other species of the genus Scalpellum were found to pre-
sent more or less closely analogous phenomena. These
facts, together with those given under lb!a (and had it
not been for this latter genus, I never probably should
have struck on the right line in my investigation), appear
sufficient to justify me in provisionally considering the
truly wonderful parasites of the several species of Scal-
pellum, as Males and Complemental Males" (vol. i. pp.
292-3>
The remarkable phenomena of sexuality in these ani-
mals is summed up thus :
"The simple fact of the diversity in the sexual relations,
displayed within the limits of the genera Ibla and Scal-
pellum, appears to me eminently curious. We have (1)
a female, with a male (or rarely two) permanently attached
to her, protected by her, and nourished by any minute
animals which may enter her sac; (2) a female, with
successive pairs of short-lived males, destitute of mouth
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
and stomach, inhabiting the pouches formed on the under
sides of her two valves; (3) an hermaphrodite, with from
one or two, up to five or six similar short-lived males
without mouth or stomach, attached to one particular spot
on each side of the orifice of the capitulum; and (4) her-
maphrodites, with occasionally one, two, or three males,
capable of seizing and devouring their prey in the ordinary
Cirripedal method, attached to two parts of the capitulum,
in both cases being protected by the closing of the
scuta."
With reference to these Complemental Males (so
called " to show that they do not pair with a female, but
with a bisexual individual") Mr. Darwin further observes:
"Nothing strictly analogous is known in the animal
kingdom; but amongst plants, in the Linnean class,
Polygamia, closely similar instances abound ;" and also
that "in the series of facts now given we have one curious
illustration more to the many already known, how
gradually nature changes from one condition to the other,
in this case from bisexuality to unisexuality" (ii. 29).

discovery of some cause which could be reasonably re-
garded as not incommensurate with some of the effects
ascribed to it. And, unlike the desperate though most
laudable gropings of Lamarck, the simple solution fur-
nished by Darwin was precisely what was required to
give a locus standi to the evidence of descent.
But we should form a very inadequate estimate of the
services rendered to science by Mr. Darwin if we were
to stop here. The few general facts out of which the
iheory of evolution by natural selection is' formedviz.
struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and heredity
were all previously well-known facts; and we may not
unreasonably feel astonished that so apparently obvious
a combination of them as that which occurred to Mr.
Darn in should have occurred to no one else, with the
single exception of Mr. Wallace. The fact that it did not
do so is most fortunate in two respectsfirst, because it
gave Mr. Darwin the opportunity of pondering upon the
subject ab initio, and next because it gave the world an
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
opportunity of witnessing the disinterested unselfishness
which has been so signally and so consistently displayed
by both these English naturalists. But the greatness of
Mr. Darwin as the reformer of biology is not to be esti-
mated by the fact that he conceived the idea of natural
selection; his claim to everlasting memory rests upon
the many years of devoted labour whereby he tested this
idea in all conceivable waysamassing facts from every
department of science, balancing evidence with the
soundest judgment, shirking no difficulty, and at last
astonishing the world as with a revelation by publishing
the completed proof of evolution. Indeed, so colossal is
Mr. Darwin's greatness in this respect, that we doubt
whether there ever was a man so well fitted to undertake
the work which he has so successfully accomplished.
For this work required not merely vast and varied know-
ledge of many provinces of science, and the very excep-
tional powers of judgment which Mr. Darwin possessed,
but also the patience to labour for many years at a great
generalisation, the honest candour which rendered the
author his own best critic, and last, though perhaps not
least, the magnanimous simplicity of character which, in
rising above all petty and personal feelings, delivered a
thought-reversing doctrine to mankind, with as little dis-
turbance as possible of the deeply-rooted sentiments of

the age. In the chapter of accidents, therefore, it is a
singularly fortunate coincidence that Mr. Darwin was the
man to whom the idea of natural selection occurred; for
although in a generation or two the truth of evolution might
have become more and more forced upon the belief of
science, and with it the acceptance of natural selection as
an operating cause, in our own generation this could only
have been accomplished in the way that it was accom-
plished; we required one such exceptional mind as that
of Darwin to focus the facts, and to show the method.
It seems almost .needless to turn from this aspect of
our subject to enlarge upon the influence which a general
acceptance of the theory of descent has had upon biology.
We do not state the case too strongly when we say that
this has been the influence which has created organisation
out of confusion, brought the dry bones to life, and made
all the pieviously dissociated facts of science stand up as
an exceeding great army. Let any one turn to the eloquent
prophecy with which the pages of the "Origin of Species"
terminatea prophecy which sets forth in order the trans-
forming effect that the doctrine of evolution would in

twenty years has in so astonishing a measure verified the
prophecy of the "Origin of Species," surely, in conclu-
sion, we are more than ever constrained to agree with the
sentiments expressed by its closing words :" When I
view all beings, not as special creations, but as the lineal
descendants of some few beings which lived long before
the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited, they
seem to me to become ennobled. . . . There is grandeur
in this view of life, with its several powers, having been
originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or
into one ; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on
according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a
beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonder-
ful have been, and are being evolved."

nature, and, as the old saw has it, dolus latet ingeneralibus.
This year the work has put on very much more of a quan-
titative look, and each observation therefore more or less
means a real step in advance. And indeed the time had
come when this should be so, for day by day the quantity
of laboratory work done which can be more or less com-
pared with eclipse observations is increasing, and in the
case of general observations either in one case or the other
comparisons are impossible. I have taken many prior
occasions of insisting upon this point; but perhaps the
reason why this principle has been so generally acted
upon on the present occasion has been a capital example
set to future eclipse parties. Some days before the
eclipse there was a regular Congress of the leaders of the
different expeditions and the chief observers, held under
the presidency of Mahmoud Pacha, the astronomer at
Cairo, and not only was the general plan of observations
agreed upon but the necessity of a limited field of inquiry
was generally acknowledged; hence at the moment of the
eclipse each worker had only a limited part of the spec-
trum to study, and the instrument to be employed what-
ever its form, and there were many forms employed, was
carefully prepared for this part, and this part only, before
totality.
In the way of dispersion, MM. Thollon and Trc!pied

outdistanced all their confreres, as each had the most
powerful form of Thollon spectroscope yet constructed.
The dispersion in this instrument is about the same as
that given by a Rutherfurd grating (of 17,000 lines to the
inch) in the third order, with this important difference,
that the quantity of light is much greater, so that a spec-
trum can be much better observed. With these spectro-
scopes, object-glasses of 9 inches aperture, and siderostats
of a simple altazimuth focus were employed. All the
other spectroscopic arrangements, whether for eye or
photography, were mounted on equatorial stands. The
instruments employed for exposing the rapid plates, which

therefore probably best represented in prominence-spec-
trum. B and C, layers further from the sun, and there-
fore cooler, and therefore probably best represented in
spot-spectrum.
If this be so, when'we can see the lines of these layers
we shall see something like this
The lines of Athe hottest layerwill be brightest
and shortest.
The lines of Bthe next cooler layerwill be less bright
and longer, and will also go down to the sun, on account
of the part of the layer at B, although it is unrepresented
at A, along the section XY.
And so on with C.
In an eclipse we have a condition in which the atmo-
spheric light is gradually withdrawn. The lines should
appear, therefore, in the order of their lengths ; that is,
the line which turns out to be longest should be the last
to appear, and this is a magnificent proof that the sub-
stance which produces the line does not extend down to
the sun, for if it did it should be brightest at bottom, and
should at first appear as a short line.

the order of appearance
May 17, 8.18 a.m., saw F and T, very short.
(T, meaning the single iron line of the three w/d.9233
so constantly seen by Tacchini in prominences).
8.19 ... F + Tt + 4933 short.
8.20 ... F + Tj + 4933 + b long.
8.23 ... F + Ti + 4933 + b + T2 short.
(T2 meaning a high temperature iron line at wl50176,
constantly seen by Tacchini with 49233).
At this time the darkness sensibly decreased, and then
for the first time several long thin lines suddenly burst
out
8.23.30 : Single iron line at 49565, and double at 4918
and 49195 and line at 49325, the last three being the
longest. Other long lines made their appearance, but
their positions were not absolutely determined.
Totality was announced at 8h. 25m. 42s., and it was
arranged that I should then change my instrument. I
fancy the signal was given a little too soon, for when I
went to my 3$ telescope to study the structure of the
corona the cross wires were still some distance from the
point at which the sun disappeared ; but be this as it

may, I missed the flash, but this was unimportant, the
real work was done. Still this is a point so crucial that
we ought not to be satisfied till all these changes, even
including the flash, have been photographed on a moving
photographic plate, an idea which struck me too late for
utilisation during the present eclipse.
Next, as to the structure of the corona. Again the
predictions were fulfilled ; we were in presence of a repe-
tition of the eclipse of 1871; everything special to that
of 1878 had disappeared. There was absolutely no struc-
ture near either pole. I was using the same telescope as
in 1878, when this feature was so marked, so there can
be no mistake on this point. The filamentous character
of the streamers, a marked feature in 1871, was however
not so decided.
As with the structure so with the ring spectrum. The
rings so bright in 1871, so conspicuously absent in 1878,
were again visible, but with a Rutherfurd grating they
were not so obvious as I at all events expected to find
them. As seen at mid-eclipse, 1474 was the faintest ring,
and C the brightest.

We believe that Pasteur was the first to suggest, twenty
years ago, that the process of nitrification going on in
soils and waters might be due to the agency of an
organism; but it was not until the last five years that the
researches of Schlosing and Miintz and of Warhgton
conclusively showed that this is the case and that the
organism is a bacterium. This bacterium is present in
all fertile service soils and under the proper conditions of
temperature, moisture, supply of oxygen, and presence of
salifiable base is continually converting ammonia and
nitrogenous organic matter, which has passed the putre-
factive stage, into nitrates. That nitrates are the chief
form from which most crops and especially the cereals
assimilate their nitrogen is now admitted generally, even
by the few physiologists who still cling to the belief that
plants can assimilate free atmospheric nitrogen ; the very
great use of this nitrifying organism is thus apparent. It
may be remarked in passing that this Schizomycete is
able to effect a change in a mineral substance, a nmonia,

causing its oxidation into nitric acid, all other known organised ferments being concerned in the transformation
of organic bodies, and this is an operation hitherto un-
suspected in the life of any Bacteria.
Nitrification takes place in soils most rapidly in the hot
months of the year, and as a cereal crop assimilates
little or no nitrogen after June, but merely transfers that
already taken up and present in the roots, stems and leaves
to other organs, it follows that, on a cornfield, in the late
summer and the autumn months, nitrates will be formed
and, will, in the event of wet weather, be readily washed
out of the soil.
Observations made during many years at Rothamsted,
and recently published by Messrs. Lawes, Gilbert, and
Warington,1 show the extent to which this loss of nitrates
may occur. They find that on land uncropped and un-
manured, that is, a bare fallow, during 4 years 1878-1881,
nearly forty-two pounds of nitrogen per acre per annum,
equal to nearly two and a half hundredweight of ordinary
nitrate of soda, was lost by drainage. They also estimate
that on land under continuous wheat cropping from ten
to twelve pounds of nitrogen per acre per annum was lost
by drainage from plots which received no nitrogenous
manure. When nitrogen is applied in the manure, considerably larger quantities are lost in the drainage, and
this is exclusive of that diffused into the lower layers of
soil below the reach of plant roots, and of that which

elementary nitrogen.
In an ordinary rotation the loss of nitrogen will be
considerably less than in these experiments, for crops
will often be growing for months after the cereal crop is
removed, and thus conserve the available nitrogen an i
store it up for future use. It is however obvious, that,
with a bare fallow favouring the production of nitrate1,
followed by a wet season, a very considerable loss of
available nitrogen will occur through loss of nitrates, ani

He examined every step in the observers' computations,
especially all that related to the adjustments of the instru-

an enormous mass of calculations so severely criticised,
and where necessary, repeated." In the latter part of
1880, the calculations with portions of introduction for

The volume is divided into five parts, referring to as
many expeditions for the observation of the transit, with
an appendix. Part I. treats of the expedition to the
Sandwich Islands, and the observations at Honolulu,
Kailua, and Waimea; II. the expedition to Egypt

Rodriguez, and the observations at Point Venus, Point

in New Zealand. The observations and reductions in
the expedition to the Sandwich Islands are printed at
much length, but particulars relating to the other expedi-
tions were presented on the scale which Sir George Airy
had proposed in an address to the Royal Astronomical
Society in March, 1875. It 's hardly necessary to say
that the actual observations of the transit are given in

which last method Sir George Airy had called early
attention, as one which it might be essential to apply in
certain cases. The reduction of the observations is
carried to the formation of the equations of condition,
from which the parallax, Sec, have to be determined.
Sir G. Airy says he has "endeavoured to give the equa-
tions in the shape that will admit of combination in the
easiest way for the computer's further operations
(whether he may desire to use the Calculus of Probabili-
ties for the whole, or to make any special selection of
combinations)when he shall have decided on the re-
corded phase of contact of limbs which he thinks best to
adopt."
The Appendix contains some tabular details and an
account of photographic observations of the transit. The
photographs are preserved at the Royal Observatory, and
Sir G. Airy considers it possible that some astronomer
may deem them worthy of rediscussion, though he does
not anticipate that any great improvement can be made
in measuring them.

We regret this failure the more because the author, as

fervour of a deeply religious mind. Indeed, we may
question whether there is not rather too much of this,
even in view of the emotional effects which it seems to
be the main object of the speaker to produce. The in-
tellectual or argumentative object throughout is to show
that the "ideality in the physical sciences" points to
ideation in the source of the physical universe, or, to
quote the concluding paragraph : "Judge the tree by its
fmit. Is this magnificent display of ideality a human
delusion, or is it a divine record? The heavens and the
earth have spoken to declare the glory of God. It is not
a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing. It is the
power of an infinite imagination, signifying immor-

Difficult Cases of Mimicry
In the very interesting communication by Mr. Wallace, in
Nature, ante p. 86, on some difficult cases of mimicry, there is
one statement 11 hich apparently challenges comment.
Mr. Wallace states that although it has been so suggested, it
is highly improbable that young birds have a hereditary instinct
enabling them to distinguish uneatable butterflies antecedent to
experience. Mr. Wallace has not alluded to the very thorough
and careful experiments made by the late Mr. Dougl. A. Spalding
on this point. It is unnecessary to refer to the results obtained
by Mr. Spalding in proving the inherited acquisition of ideas
and experience in young chicken-, it will at least suffice to repeat
the observations made by him, on the actions of a young turkey
which he had adopted"When chirping within the uncracked
shell." Now this young turkey, not only on the tenth day of its
life, exhibited the most intense terror at the sound of a hawk's
voice which was confined in a cupboard but also proved its in-
herited knowledge of uneatable insects.
"When a week old my turkey came on a bee right in its path
the first, I believe, it had ever seen. It gave the danger chirp,
stood for a few seconds with outstretched neck and marked
expression of fear, then turned off in another direction. On this
hint I made a vast number of experiments with chickens and

bees. In the great majority of instances the chickens gave
evidence of instinctive fear of these sting-bearing insects, but
the results were not uniform, and perhaps the most accurate
general statement I can give is, that they were uncertain, shy
and suspicious."
If domesticated fowls and turkeys exhibit such inherited
"instinct," may we not postulate a much greater excess of the
same in purely insectivorons birds in a state of nature. And if
this is so, it will be unnecessary to explain away, what appears to
be one of the most philosophical considerations in ihe doctrine
of "mimicry." W. L. Distant

phenomena of the conversion of iron into steel in the cementation
process all point to the conclusion that the carbon is simply
absorbed, as the varying rate of impregnation with variations of
temperature, the gradual change from the outside to the inside,
and the large deposition of free carbon from such steel, if dis-
solved in hydrochloric acid, or chloride of copper, or cold dilute
nitric acid.
As to No. 2, the author adopts the theory of Jullien, that the
hardening of steel is due to the crystallisation of the so-called com-
bined carbon (really absorbed) in a form resembling the diamond.
He observes that cemented steel only becomes hard when
heated and quenched, and that the fracture then shows innumer-
able small crystals, which, under the microscope, present physical
features very much like small diamonds. These crystals do not
appear in wrought iron, increase in number as the proportion of
carbon increases, and as the hardening increases, and are more
numerous at the outside of the piece, where the hardness is al-o
less. They are therefore crystallised carbon, in other word--,
diamond. Estimations of carbon in the different layers of a
piece of hardened steel have always shown that the actual pro-
portions, as formed by combustion, are the same throughout,

but that, as examined by the colour test, they increase gradually
from the outside to the inside. This shows that some change
has taken place in the carbon. The author's theory is that at a
red heat the molecules of iron are expanded and partially sepa-
rated ; that in this state the absorbed carbon is partially disso-
ciated from the iron, and upon the steel being suddenly
quenched, the carbon is not reabsorbed, tut takes up a small
amount of hydrogen, and is fixed in the state of diamond. It is
known that hydrogen is present in the diamond, and also in steel,
and it is submitted that it forms the active agent in reducing the
carbon from the amorphous to the crystalline form. On ana-
lysing this hardened steel, it is supposed that the crystallii e
carbon goes off in all cases as gas; so that less "combined
carbon will remain to be shown by the colour tests or deposited on
solution in hydrochloric acid. It must follow from this view that
carbon is the acting hardener of steel, and that the idea of other
elements, as phosphorus hardening steel is a delusion. In support of this it is observed that phosphorus does not harden
wrought iron and that probably the real effect of phosphoius
and silicen is to cause dissociation of carbon, thus producing a
larger extent of crystallisation and a harder metal. Thus it is
found that the higher the proportion of phosphorus, the greater
will be the difference between the carbon, as shown by the colour
test, and as fixed by analysis. Again, English Bessemer or
Siemens steel will require 20 per cent, less carbon to make it
work and harden equally well with best Swedi-h steel; the
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
explanation being that the phosphorus in the former assists the
dissociation and crystallisation. To this effect of phosphorus
many of the mysterious failures of steel may probably be traced.
With regard to No. 3. the author regards the variations of
tempering as due solely to the completeness, or otherwise, of the
decomposition of the crystalline carbon in the hardened steel.
He observes that carbon and ir> n have no action on each other
at the heat at which tempering is effected; while, even at such
temperatures, the abstraction of hydrogen from carbon, in the
presence of iron, cannot be deemed impossible. The tempering
of steel by simply querching it in hot water or oil, may thus be
explained; the outer layers may be supposed to be hardened at
first in the ordinary way, but then, as the interior heat does not
pass away si rapidly, it has time to act on the crystalline carbon,
and partly to dissociate it agar", thus prcdu»ing something be-
tween hardened and unhardened steelin other words, tempered
steel. The crystallised carbon in the hardened steel is supposed
to be diffused in a state of molecular disaggregation, and to be
less intimately united with the iron than before hardening.
As to No. 4, the startling statement that the ultimate strength
of steel is very little dependent on its amount of carbon, is ex-

distinct from the other British species.
It will be remarked that all the English species are
from marine or estuarine deposits, and it is a singular fact
that no trace whatever of leaves or fruit of the Abietineae
have been found in those plant beds of freshwater origin
in England, which have recently yielded such exceedingly
rich floras. It is equally strange that all our Eocene
cones from the London clay and strata beneath have
been imbedded before shedding their seed, while those
from the Middle and Upper Eocenes are gaping and
seedless. If inference upon such slender ground were
permissible, it would seem as if those that were imbedded
during the cooler Lower Eocene period had grown near
to where they were imbedded, and their leaves may yet
be found in our little-known Lower Eocene floras, while
those that were imbedded during the hottest Eocene
periods had drifted a long way. The well-ascertained
absence of pine foliage during the Middle Eocene in
England, and the constantly-decayed condition of the
cones, are the data upon which this view may be grounded.
Farther north, at Antrim, as we should anticipate, the
cones seem more perfect.
It appears desirable to test the relative length of time
that ripe and unripe pine cones, seeds and foliage will
float, especially in sea-water, and the length of time

required to reduce them to the decayed condition of the
Barton and Bracklesham specimens, and it is to be hoped
that some one possessing facilities, will undertake experi-
ments.
It will also be interesting to trace out why cones so
frequently fall in a closed unripe condition. A Bourne-
mouth resident writes to me that it takes three years for
the cone to come to perfection, and that if it remains on
the tree all that time, the scales open wide as it hangs,
beginning at the base, and making a plainly audible
crackling noise as they separate. This occurs chiefly on
sunny summer days. The seeds being liberated, either
fall or are picked out by tom-tits.
Cedrus.Only four species, or varieties according to
some, are knownthe Himalayan, Lebanon, Atlas, and
Cyprus cedars. The cones are globose and erect on the
upper side of the branches. The scales are thin, leathery,
and closely pressed together, and persist for some time
after the seeds are shed. The cones break up on the
trees, and fall piecemeal, the scales falling separately,
except near the apex, where they remain together as a

paper by its own momentum only. On falling back.
should the striker, T, be still kept raised, the pricker will
rest upon it, but its point will be free of the cylinder, and
at some distance, n, below it. The strikers, Tu &c,
are worked by electro-magnets: the spiral spring shown
just above the head of each pricker, is compressed when
the pricker is projected between the head and sheath, and
assists in the disengagement of the pricker from the
paper. The punctures of the prickers are very marked
and distinct.
A NON-ELECTRIC INCANDESCENT LAMP A BRIGHT light, easily obtained and sufficient for
projections, has frequently been regarded as a
desideratum, where it has been impracticable to procure
either the electric or the lime-light. The French Minister
of Public Instruction lately appointed a special commis-
sion to indicate the apparatus most suitable for projection
in primary schools; and it appeared that while there was
no lack of simple arrangements for the projection proper,

the problem of easy production of an adequate luminous
source was hardly solved.
Dr. Regnard has lately conceived the idea of getting a
bright light by burning on platinum gauze a mixture of
air and petroleum vapour. The intense heat which re-
sults raises the platinum to bright incandescence, giving
a light equal to about half the lime-light.
The apparatus (described in La Nature, to which we
are indebted for the accompanying figure) is very simple.
There is an ordinary Bunsen burner, terminated by a
small cage of platinumwvire. The mixture of air and
petroleum vapour is admitted below, in place of the gas;
it is produced by a familiar method, and the current is
generated by means of a pair of bellows or a Richardson
 pear. With a ventilator or  trompe, several of the
lamps may be maintained in action at once, for lighting
halls, workshops, &c., where there is no gas. The aspect

CHEMICAL LECTURE EXPERIMENTS
SEVERAL interesting and instructive experiments have
been described of late in the chemical journals: we
propose to give a short account of the more important.
I.Physico-chemical Experiments
A. Mixing of Gases by Diffusion.That gases do not
mix very rapidly by diffusion alone, may be illustrated by
placing a strip of white paper moistened with lead acetate
solution inside a tall glass stoppered cylinder, so that
when the cylinder is inverted the paper extends from the
bottom (which now forms the uppermost end) not more
than one-third of the total length of the cylinder. A little
sulphuretted hydrogen water is placed in the hollow stopper
of the cylinder, and the stopper is inserted loosely into its
place. After ten to fifteen minutes the production of
brown lead sulphide on the white paper shows that the sul-
phuretted hydrogen gas has risen two-thirds of the height
of the cylinder. Paper moistened with starch and potas-
sium iodide, and chlorine water, may respectively replace
the lead acetate paper and the sulphuretted hydrogen
water (C. von Than, Berichte, xii. 1414).

B. Liquefaction of Gases by Increasing Pressure or
Lowering Temperature.Ethylic chloride, which boils at
12°, is easily liquefied. A Hofmann's lecture eudiometer,
with one limb about 100 cm. and the other 50 cm. in
length, serves as apparatus. The eudiometer is filled
with mercury; ethylic chloride gas is led into the shorter
limb through the upper stopcock, while the mercury flows
out by the other stopcock; when the smaller limb is partly
filled with gas, the mercury is adjusted to the same level
in both limbs, the gas is liquefied by pouring ether over
the shorter limb, and any air which has entered with the
gas is allowed to escape by opening the upper stopcock
for a moment. The liquid ethylic chloride is gasified by
running out as much as possible of the mercury in the
larger limb, and so reducing the pressure. If the tem-
perature is loweredby pouring ether on to the outside of
the shorter limbor if the pressure is increasedby
pouring mercury into the longer limb, equal to an extra
half atmosphere of pressurethe ethylic chloride becomes
liquid (Hofmann, Berichte, xii. 1124).
C. Absorption of Heat Accompanying Change from
Liquid to Gaseous Form.A test tube, partly filled with
water, is placed in a small glass cylinder containing ether
sufficient to completely cover that part of the tube in
which there is water. A brisk stream of dry air is driven
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
through the ether, which rapidly evaporates; in a few
minutes the water in the tube is completely frozen (Hof-
mann, Berichte, xii. 1125).
D. Thermal Changes Attending Solution of Salts in
Water.A small flask of about 100 cc. capacity is fitted
with a cork carrying a glass tube, 3-4 mm. diameter, bent
twice at right angles; the larger limb of the tuhe is about
70 cm. in length, and passes through a cork nearly to the
bottom of a wide-mouthed bottle, of about 40 cc. capacity,
containing coloured water. A straight piece of similar
tubing of about the same length passes through a second
hole in the cork, and also reaches nearly to the bottom of
the wide-mouthed bottle. The salt under examination is
placed in the flask, water is added, and the cork is in-
serted. If heat is evolved during solution, the coloured
water rises in the straight glass tube, which is open at
the upper end; if heat is absorbed during solution, the
water rises in the tube connected with the small flask
(Rosenfeld, Berichte, xiii. 1475).

III.Experiments Illustrative of Combustion
Phenomena
A. Bunting Oxygen in Sulphur Vapour.A two-
necked balloon is fitted with cork?, each carrying a tube,
one of which passes towards the bottom of the balloon,
and has its tip slightly bent upwards, the other, begin-
ning flush with the inner surface of the cork, passes
downwards into a cylinder containing water. The first
of these tubes communicates, by means of a long piece
of caoutchouc tubing, with a supply of dry oxygen. About
40 to 50 grams of dry sulphur are placed in the balloon,
and heated till the vessel is quite filled with reddish
vapours, the oxygen delivery tube being meanwhile with-
drawn. Oxygen is allowed to flow from the delivery tube
in a stream sufficiently rapid to cause a glowing chip of wood
held 2 to 3 millims. from the ejid of the tube to burst into
flame; a small piece of charcoal is attached by platinum
wire to the tip of the oxygen delivery tube ; the charcoal
is ignited, and the cork carrying the tube which delivers
o.\ygen is inserted into the neck of the balloon. The
oxygen is soon seen burning in the vapour of sulphur

which fills the vessel; the product of combustion, viz. sul-
phur dioxide, is led by the second tube into the water in
the cylinder, the presence of sulphurous acid in which is
easily exhibited (C. von Tham, loc. cii.).
B. Burning Sulphuretted Hydrogen in Vapour of
Nitric Acid.60 to 80 c.c. of concentrated nitric acid
(sp. gr. i'53) are placed in a flask of 500 c.c. capacity. A
rapid stream of sulphuretted hydrogen is passed, through
water, into the acid, whereupon red fumes are copiously
produced. The delivery tube is slowly raised from the
surface of the acid towards the neck of the flask; at a
certain'distance from the acid the sulphuretted hydrogen
take; fire and burns with a blue flame; the upper part of
the flask becomes filled with white fumes of sulfuric acid,
the lower part with red fumes of oxides of nitrogen, little
or no sulphur separating (Kessel, Bericlite, xii. 2305).
C. Burning Ammonia in Oxygen.A wide-mouthed
flask .s fitted with a cork, which carries a tube passing
nearly to the bottom of the flask, and also a large straight
drying tube, which contains solid caustic soda and is
closed at its upper end by a cork carrying a little piece of
tubing drawn out to an opening about 2 mm. in diameter.
A quantity of strong ammonia liquor is placed in the flask
and heated nearly to boiling, the lamp is withdrawn, and
the cork with its tube inserted. A stream of oxygen is

pas-ed into the hot liquor, and the dry ammonia, mixed
with oxygen, is ignited as it issues from the caustic soda
tube. As the amount of ammonia diminishes, the flame
becomes smaller, but very hot ; a piece of platinum wire
may be melted, or a lime cylinder may be caused to give
out much light, by holding it just above the central zone
of the flame (Rosenfeld, Berichte, xiv. 2104, and xv. 169.)
D. To s/ioiv that Water is produced by Burning Hydro-
gen in Oxygen.A small platinum flask (as is figured in
Roscoe and Schorlemmer's "Chemistry," I., p. 339) is
lurnished with a good cork carrying two tubes of ordinary
pipe-clay, which reach towards the bottom of the flask:
one of these tubes communicates by caoutchouc tubing
with a supply of dry hydrogen, the other with a supply of
dry oxygen. The exit-tube of the flask is attached to a
piece of glass tubing which connects with a glass worm
condenser, underneath which a beaker is placed. Dry
hydrogen is passed into the flask until the air is com-
pletely replaced from the entire apparatus: while this is
being done, the caoutchouc tubing which connects the
clay tube with the oxygen supply is securely clamped just

Messrs. Hachette and Co. have just published two "map-
size" chromo-lithographic plates of the "Phylloxera de la
Vigne," one of which illustrates the habits of the insect, whereas
the other represents it in its varied stages and conditions. They
are especially suitable for the lecture-room, and their distribution
in some of our colonies might serve to nip unnecessary panic in
the bud. All the figures are enormously enlarged, and highly
(perhaps a little too highly) coloured, with full explanatory text.
Miss Ormerod's "Reports of Observations on Injurious
Insects during the year 1881" (W. Swan Sonnenschein and Co.)
is far more bulky than its predecessors. This is mainly due to
a lengthy and valuable series of reports on the Turnip Fly, which
we commend to the notice of all who are likely to be directly
influenced by this pest. Other old fiiends (?) receive their
usual share of attention. Miss Ormerod was recently appointed
honorary consulting entomologist to the Royal Agricultural
Society.
The following is the programme of the Davis Lectures on
zoological subjects which will be given in the lecture-room in the

We are glad to notice that the Principal of the Royal Agri-
cultural College at Cirencester has supplemented the teaching of
biology in that institution, by establishing a thoroughly equipped
and efficient biological laboratory. One of the largest and best
lighted rooms in the college has been devoted to this purpose,
and under the direction of Prof. Harker, has been furnished
with dissecting tables and apparatus suited to modern require-
ments for the effective teaching of the subject. A number of
microscopes have been provided; and practical demonstrations
in the laboratory now form a necessary part of the course. The
students are afforded every opportunity of acquainting them-
selves with the methods of microscopic manipulation. A special
collection of types and a reference library in biology are to form
part of the new institution. In view of the growing importance
of biology in relation to agriculture, we think this is a wise step
in the interests of the student.
According to the Golos correspondent at Singapore, M.
Miklukho Maclay was at that place on April 10, on his return

from Australia and on his way home. But his visit home is
to be short, as he expects soon to return to Australia, where
he has left his large collections. His health is very bad in con-
sequence of continuous fever and neuralgia, and notwithstanding
his being only thirty-seven years old, he looks an old man. His
twelve years' travel, accompanied with all possible privations,
has broken his health. It is to be feared therefore that the
publication of the results of his journeys and the description of
his extensive collection will be considerably delayed.
In the Scandinavian Exhibition now being held at South
Kensington, there is a very fine and complete collection of
objects in prehistoric archaeology.
We have received the second part of the "Descriptions of
new Indian Insects from the Collections of the late Mr. W. S.
Atkinson," by Mr. Frederic Moore (published by the Asiatic
Society of Bengal). The remarks that have already appeared
in Nature, concerning the first part, apply equally to this,
and we defer a longer notice until the completion of the work.

Norwegian naturalist to conduct a scientific mission to Kam-
chatka. At two days' notice, Herr Stejneger started, on March
22, well supplied by the U.S. Signal Service Department with
all the instruments and appliances necessary for carrying out his
instructions which emanate conjointly from the Smithsonian and
the U.S. Meteorological Institutions. A year and a half has
been suggested as the term of his mission, but in this, as in
other matters, he is left to follow his own judgment in regard to
the best way of attaining the objects it is proposed to secure.
These are: (1) the erection of a meteorological station, of the
first class if possible, on the coast of Kamchatka, and one of
the second or third class >n Behring Island, and at Petro-
pawlovsk, for each of which he is to make arrangements that
will secure their permanent efficiency after his departure; (2) in
the capacity of a member of the U.S. Fish Commission, to draw
up a report of the fishing-grounds, more espec:ally with reference
to the condition of the cod-fisheries; (3) to collect, for the
national museum the largest attainable number of the remains of
the now extinct Rhytina, or Arctic sea-cow, good skins of Phoca
Uonina, Otaria ursina, and other sea-animals, together with a
few skeletons and a large number of the crania of these and other

marine mammals, and of the local birds and fishes. Herr Stej-
neyer promises to keep the readers of Araturtn acquainted with
the success that may attend him in the prosecution of his various
and arduous labours.
We are glad to observe that the telegraph is making rapid
way in China. The Shanghai-Tientsin line has been working
now for a few months, and a line is being constructed in the
south between Canton and Hongkonga distance of about 100
miles. The first section is to connect Canton, which is practically
the commercial capital of China, with the frontier of British
Kowloon, situated opposite the town of Victoria. After some
consideration it has been decided that a land-line is preferable to
a submarine cable, as it will be more economical, and the latter
also would seriously interfere with the enormous junk traffic and
fishing operations in the estuary of the Canton River. It is
interesting to remark that this line is purely a private under-
taking of a company of Chinese merchants in Canton, who,
doubtless, want to be on a level with their brethren in the north, in rapidity of communication with the markets of the world.
The line, as above stated, will for the the present terminate on
the confines of British territory. It seems hardly crediblebut
the fact is stated in the Hongkong journalsthat opposition is
made by the British authorities to the further construction of
the line, and especially to the cable across the harbour necessary
to connect Kowloon with Hongkong, unless it is constructed by
a British company, j

We regret to see that the project of a meteorological observa-
tory in Hongkong, which we have alreadydescribed in Nature,
is still "under consideration." Major -.Palmer's ;very complete
scheme, on which we commented at the time, was in the hands
of the Colonial Office six months ago, but nothing has since
been done, and there seems to be grounds for the fear that a
work of much importance, local as well as general, for which
funds are amply provided by the colonial authorities, will be
postponed so long that the officer to whose knowledge and ability
the scheme is chiefly due will have left the colony. It will be
difficult and may be impossible to find a well-qualified substitute
in a small community such as that of Hongkong.
The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain propose to hold
next year an exhibition similar to the one held in the year
1868 at the Crystal Palace, with the object of ascertaining the
position of the science of aeronautics, and with the view of
affording an opportunity to inventors to embody and exhibit the
results of their labours. Several prizes will be offered, and an

the substance could be heated in a test-tube; and the other con-
sisted of a platinum vessel co constructed that the substance
could be inserted into a horizontal tube.
Although l.aspeyres in the article just quoted argues most
conclusively that an absolutely constant temperature cannot be
maintained by controlling the gas-supply, and Jac. Myers con-
cludes his considerations on the subject by saying, "For so long
must we give up the hope of being able to regulate these tem-
peratures at pleasure," yet the subject of temperature-regulators
is one to which so many have at various times turned their
attention, that a comparison of the different methods is not
without interest. Most of the instruments constructed may be
classified under one or another of the following heads, viz., as
modified :-
Air thermometers, with mercury or other fluid arranged to
control supply of gas :(a) in which the mercury employed
becomes more or less heated while in use; (//) in which the
mercury or other fluid does not become heated.
Mercurial thermometers (a) acting directly on gas-supply;
(b) acting on gas-supply through the intervention of electric
arrangements.

Vapour-tension thermometers.
Air \Thermometers (a).Kemp's regulator (1852) consists of
a glass tube, at one end of which an elongated bulb is blown;
the part of the tube near the bulb is then bent s 1 that the open
end of the tube and the bulb are parallel.1 Sufficient mercury i»
then introduced to partly fill the bulb, the remainder being
occupied by air. To the open end of the tube is cemented a
bras? cap, which is provided at the side with the ga- inlet tube,
aud in the centre with a stuffing box, through which the bra-s
ou'let tube slides. The temperature is adjusted by moving this
tube up or down as the case may be.
Bunsen's modification made the apparatus more compact, but
not so simple or easy of construction.2 It consists of a glass
cylinder whose lower part is clo-ed, and serves as air-ves-el
which communicate 1 with the upper portion by a tube reaching
nearly to the bottom. In the upper portion is inserted a wide
glass tube which is provided with a side-tube, and which dips
into the mercury. Fastened to the up; er end of this tube is the
gas-upply tube, which is rather shorter, and which has a fine
opening in it. The position of these tubes i.< adjusted by the
screw-thread in a brass cap, which works on a corresponding
thread in the supply tube. The two pnrts of the apparatus are
held together by a spring (in the newer patterns this is replaced
by a pin woiking in a groove).
His low-temperature regulator has a much larger air-chamber,

so as to increase its sensitiveness.' It is also provided with a
side-tube fitted with a stopcock, so that mercury may be added
or drawn off at pleasure. Guthrie* (1868) constructed a regu-
lator on Kemp's principle, but attached the top of the vertical
tabe to the bottom of an U-tube which the gas had to traverse,
 W that the mercury on rising checked the flow. The adjustment
* consisted of a side tube (bent at a right angle) attached to the
vertical tube; in that tube a glass red could be raised or de-
pre-sed, being held in its position by passing through a perforated
cork. Miincke's5 (1876) is very similar to Bunsen's, but the
bras cap and fittings are entirely dispensed with, as the gas-
supply pipe works stiffly through a perforated cork which fits the
top of the tube

A piece of glass tube about seven-sixteenths of an inch diameter
and IJ inch long is fitted at one end with a short round cork;
through the centre of this cork a hole is bored, so that the stem
of the thermometer just fits in it; the other end of this glass
tube is closed by a short tightly-fitting india-rubber cork, which
is pierced by a fine brad-awl through its centre. Into the hole
thus formed is forced a piece of fine glass tubing three inches
long and small enough to fit loosely inside the stem of the
thermometer. The gas enters by this fine tube.
Fletcher2 (1876) stated that he had for some time used a
similar regulator, but that the thermometer had an iron bulb
capable of containing two or three pounds of mercury. He also
reversed the direction of the gas.
Mercurial Thermometers (b).Scheibler3 (1865) devised the
following arrangement. In the bath or chamber which is being
heated is placed an electric thermometer; this communicates
with an electro-magnet which is inclosed in a small metallic
chamber through which the gas for the burner has to pass.
When by a rise in temperature the circuit is closed, the
hinged armature of the magnet is brought into contact with the

opening of the gas inlet-tube, and is not liberated until a fall in
the temperature breaks the circuit.
O. Zabel4 (1867) placed in communication with an electric
thermometer a contrivance which consisted of two electro-
magnets acting on a hinged metallic screen. The completion
of the circuit by a rise in temperature placed the screen over the
flame, and thus checked the heat.
J. Maistre5 (1866) recommended an electric thermometer con-
nected with an electro-magnet, the armature of which could
remove the gas-burner from under the bath, or which could be
connected by means of a lever with the gas-supply tap.
Springmuhl" (1871) arranged an electro-magnet with a hinged
armature, so that on the completion of the circuit a weight
attached to a lever closed the gas-tap, which was not opened
until the release of the armature liberated a spring which acted
in the opposite direction.
Vapour-tension Thermometers.Appold's 7 consists of a glass
tube having a bulb at each end. The tube is filled, as also about
half of each bulb, with mercury; the lower bulb containing ether
to the depth of half an inch, which floats on the mercury. The
tube is secured to a plate of boxwood, supported on knife-
edges, on which it turns freely. At the end of the plate, under-
neath the higher bulb, is a lever, which controls the supply-valve
of a gas-stove or the damper of a furnace. With a rise in the
temperature the increased tension of the ether-vapour drives

more mercury into the upper bulb; this end then falls. With a
diminished temperature the reverse action takes place.
Andreae's8 (1878) is like Kemp's and various others, on the
principle of an U-tube with one limb closed. It is, however,
rendered more sensitive by the introduction of a certain quantity
of a volatile liquid into the air space. It must be borne in mind
that the liquid must be selected according to the temperature
required, as it is obvious that the regulator cannot be used in
any case where it has to be heated beyond the boiling-point of
the liquid. b'
Benoit9 (1879) constructed an apparatus in which he regulated
the temperature by adjusting the pressure on the volatile liquid
contained in the bulb. The following is the arrangement:A
small reservoir, which can be shaped to suit the oven or bath in
which it is placed, holds the volatile l.quid. This is connected
by means of a tube from the bcttom, to which is attached an
india-rubber tube, to a regulator of the same pattern as that
used by Keichert. The regulator is fixed on a board which can
be raised or lowered, and is provided with two side tubes for
adding or drawing off mercury at will.
By-pass.Since it is obvious that in cases where the quantity

expected that an election to the post will therefore take place

acted in the best interests of science in the University, and given
this professorship precedence amongst several other schemes
which might have been carried out by it first instead. The
Profesor is required by the Statutes to give instruction in Human
and Comparative Physiology, with histology.
Cambridge.The annual report of the Museums and Lecture
Rooms Syndicate at Cambridge has contained in past years no
more valuable record of work than that lately issued. Taking
first the department of experimental physics, \ve learn that
sixty-two students were attending the practical classes in the
Lent term, doing work which few of the candidates for the
mathematical or natural sciences triposes ever did at Cambridge
before the establishment of the Cavendish Laboratory. The
pupils in mechanism in Prof. Stuart's workshop have numbered
thirty-six during the past winter. In chemistry the increase in
the students has considerably exceeded the accommodation
available in the University laboratory, notwithstanding the
existence of several college laboratories. Professors Liveing
and Dewar plead strongly for further provision as regards both
buildings and appliances, such as may bear comparison with

those of Zurich and Bonn; they believe that to delay building
until other departments can be adequately dealt with will be
most detrimental to the present flourishing prospects of che-
mistry. A new register of the specimens in the mineralogical
museum is completed; but the want of additional apparatus is
seriously felt. Prof. Hughes records the use of the Arts School
as a lecture-room, and the arrangement for additional class and
work-rooms in the Woodwardian museum. The accessibility of
the collections, and the determinations being kept up to date,
attract many geologists who wish to pursue special investigations.
Among the additions to the collections are 700 species of Plio-
cene shells from Tuscany, casts of vertebrates from Lausanne
Miocene, 270 species of Miocene shells from the Vienna basin;
Upper greensand corals from Devonshire, many Cretaceous
specimens from the neighbourhood of Cambridge, 450 speci-
mens from Neocomian of Saint Croix, Switzerland, and casts of

specimens from Portland Sands, Swindon, Wilts, collected by
Mr. H. Keeping, the curator of the museum; numerous speci-
mens of rocks and building-stones.
Turning, now, to the biological departments, the Woodward
and Hepburn collections of shells have been carefully examined
and catalogued by the curator, Mr. A. H. Cooke. The report
gives notes upon the principal families of mollusca, as repre-
sented in the museum, with indications of gaps in the series; it

should be widely circulated in the interest of the museum itself,
as many old University students must have it in their power to
supply deficiencies at a slight cost of trouble to themselves. Mr.
Salvin reports that his catalogue of the Strickland collection of
birds is complete, making an octavo volume of 653 pages. The
species in the collection number 3125. Mrs. Strickland has pre-
sented a further portion of the valuable library of her late
husband to the museum. In Amphibia and Reptilia the collec-
tion is still relatively poor. A beautiful skeleton of Menopoma
has been prepared by W. Robinson, one of the assistants in the
museum, and a considerable number of skeletons and skins of
representative genera in these groups has been added. Among
the mammalian acquisitions should be mentioned the skeleton of
a male giraffe purchased from the Zoological Society; a skeleton
of a mare, presented by Mr. R. Pryor, of Trinity College;
skeletons of a ringed seal, a bladder-nosed seal, and a Polar
bear, all carefully killed and preserved, so that the bones were
neither injured nor missing, as is too often the case. A complete
skeleton of an Indian elephant has been given by Sir John Phear,
and a less perfect skeleton of an individual of the same species,
sent from Calcutta through the kind exertions of Sir Joseph Fayrer. English additions of interest continue to be made, such

In seme of the new specimens the vasculo-niedullary axes
jrescntno differences from these of the As trcmyel'oii already
described. The radiating lines of cells separating the lamir«e
prove to be transverse sections of elongated vertical laminae
composed of cells with a mural arrangement, andwhich separate
large vertical lacuna; of varying lengths; a type cf cortical
tissue clearly indicating a plant of aquatic habits. So far as
this bark is concerned, all the ramifications of the plant display
similar features, but several of the specimens exhibit important
variations in the structure of the vasculo-mcdullary axis. In
them the central cellular medulla is replaced by an axial va cular
bundle, which has little, or in some examples apparently no,
cellular element intermingled with the vascular portions. In
some examples this axial lundle is invested by the thick exoge-
nous zone seen in Astromyelon. In others that zone is wholly
wanting. Yet there appears to be no rea-on for doubting that
these are but varied slates of the same plant which branched
freely, the differentiated branches having, doubtless, some mor-
phological significances, as yet incapable of being explained.
That the plant was a Phanercg;m allied to Myriophyllum, is
most improbable. It has several features of resemblance to

the Cryi togamic Marsilea', fr< m which it does not differ more
widely than the fossil Lepidodendra do from the living Lyco-
podiacete.
The author describes a new specimen of Psaronius Rinaultii,
found by Mr. Wild, of Ashton-under-Lyne. Those previously
described, consisted almost entirely of fragments of the bark
and its serial rootlets. The present specimen contains a perfect
C-shaped fibro-vascular bundle and a portion of a second one,
resembling some of those described by Corda, and which leave
no room for doubting that our British Coal-measures contain at
least one arborescent fern, equal in magnitude to those obtained
from the deposits at Autun.
In his Memoir, Parts IX. and X., the author described, under
the provisional generic name of Zygosporites, some small
spherical bodies with furcate peripheral projections. Similar
bodies had been met with in France, and were regarded by
some of the French palaeontologists as true Carboniferous repre-
sentatives of the Desmidiacea?. The author w as unable to accept
this conclusion, deeming it much more probable that they would
prove to be spores of a different kind. Mr. Spencer exhibited
the specimen now described at the York meeting. It is a true
sporangium, containing a cluster of these Zygosporites. Though
they undoubtedly bear a close superficial resemblance to the
zygospores of the Desmidire, their inclosure within a common
sporangium demonstrates them to be something very different.

There is now no doubt but that they are the spores of the
strobilus, described by the author in his Memoir, Part V.,
under the name of Volkmannia Dawsoni. Hence the genus
Zygosporites may be cancelled.
Another interesting specimen found by Mr. Wild, is a young
Calamite, with a more curiously differentiated bark than any
that has hitherto been discovered. The structure of the vascular
cylinder and of the innermost layer of the bark, differs in no
essential respect from those previously described; but the outer-
most portion displays an entirely new feature. It consists of a
narrow zone of small longitudinal prosenchymatous bundles,
each one having a triangular transverse section, the apex of each
section being oirected inwards, whilst their contiguous bases are
in contact w ith what appears to be a thin epidermal layer. As
in every previously discovered Calamite in which the cortex is
preserved, the peripheral surface of this specimen is perfectly
smooth or "entire." It displays no trace of the longitudinal
ridges and furrows seen in nearly all the traditional representa-
tions of Calamites figured in our text-books.
It has long been seen that the medullary cells of the Lepidodendra, as well as the vessels of their non-exogenous medullary

doubts as to whether two varieties could affect the character of
the buds produced by either, it appearing more probable to him
that the so-called new variety was due to bud-variation. The
Baron de Villa Franca thereupon forwarded a document signed
by eight distinguished Brazilians, testifying to the fact that valu-
able varieties have been raised by the process in question. Dr.
Glass furthermore describes in detail his early but fnrtlcss

early times have been occupied by man. The exceeding rarity

record of their being found in these western Scottish Isles.

Ants, Bees, and Wasps; a Record of Observations on the
Social Hymenoptera. By Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,
M.P., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D., Pres. B.A. and L.S., &c.
International Scientific Series, Vol. XL. (London:
Kegan Paul, Trench, and Co., 1882.)
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK has done well to gather all the
results of his serially published observations on the
social hymenoptera in one treatise, and to bring out the
treatise in the International Scientific Series. On the one
hand the extensive and important research on which he
has for so many years been engaged is thus presented to
the naturalist no longer in the form of scattered papers,
and on the other hand the International Scientific Series, both on account of its popularity at home, and of its well-
organised machinery for securing rapid translations
abroad, is the most suitable place for publishing results
which are in so eminent a degree of interest to general
readers.
Looking to the investigations as a whole, or in the
connected form in which they are now presented, we think
that they deserve to be considered the most scientifically

methodical, as well as in many respects the most scien-
tifically fruitful, which have hitherto been prosecuted in
the region of comparative psychology. In saying this we
do not forget the investigations of Reaumur, Huber,
Forel, Darwin, Moggridge, McCook, Morgan, or Spald-
ingall of whom we regard as holding more substantial
claims to recognition in this respect than many others
who might be mentioned in the same connection. But
when we compare the researches of Sir John Lubbock
with those of any other comparative psychologist, we find
that he has the merit of showing, if not the greatest ap-
preciation of scientific method, at least the greatest deter-
mination in applying such method to the questions with
which comparative psychology has to deal. Darwin and
Spalding are the only other men who in this department
of science have shown an adequate estimate of the im-
portance of experiment as distinguished from observation;
but neither Darwin nor Spalding had time to experiment
in psychology on a large scalethe former having had so
many other lines of inductive and deductive research to
attend to, and the latter having died so young. Thus it
is that when we compare the investigations of Sir John
Lubbock with those of other workers in the field of
animal psychology, we must assign to him the first place
among these workers as a scientific observer.

For the most part the volume before us is a reprint of
the papers read before the Linnean Society, with only as
much re-casting as is rendered necessary to give a syste-
matic form to the book. A few coloured plates, however,
are added, as well as a brief account of some of the chief
facts recorded by other observers of ants. The latter,
indeed, is slender, and is not even attempted in the case
of bees; so that the essay is strictly, as its title proclaims,
"A record of observations on the social hymenoptera";
it is not an account of all that we know concerning the
psychology of these animals. As the essay is -sure to
attain a wide popularity, it is perhaps to be regretted that
Vol. xxvi.No. 658
its author did not take the opportunity of disseminating
complete information upon so interesting a subject, to-
gether with the " record" of his own " observations." But
this is a matter on which opinions are likely to differ, and
there can be no doubt that within the scope laid down by
its title, the work is admirably arranged.
We shall now proceed briefly to enumerate the principal
results which this record of observations sets forth.

[June 8, 1882
NATURE
The chloroformed ants were treated by their companions
as dead, but the intoxicated ones were recognised and
taken into the hive, while intoxicated strangers were
rejected. The manner in which recognition is effected
has long been a standing puzzle to observers, and although
Sir John Lubbock has not shown "how it is done," he
has at least shown very conclusively how it is not done.
Previous hypotheses supposed the faculty to depend on
recognising personal appearance, personal scent, or on
there being some pass-signal understood by all the mem-
bers of a hive, and not known to members of other hives.
But Sir John has found that the recognition is effected
when the pupa: are hatched out away from their native
hive, and even when the eggs are developed in one half of
a divided hive, and the matured insects then returned to
the other half. He also found that the memory of com-
panions or nest-mates extends over at least a year and
nine months.
Regarding the power of communication, the experi-
ments went to show a strange uncertainty, though they
agree with previous observations in establishing the main
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
fact that such a power exists. Thus, for instance, when
a dead fly was pinned down so that the ant which found
it could not drag it towards the nest, she returned to the
nest and procured assistance. This experiment was
repeated, with small variation, a great number of times,
and certainly proves a power of communication at least
to the extent of "follow me." Moreover, by an ingenious
device with three parallel tape bridges extending from a
nest to three similar glasses, one empty, another holding
a few larva.1, and the third filled with many larvae, Sir
John was able to show the interesting fact that ants
can give definite information to one another as to
locality, without requiring merely to lead the way. For
he took two ants and placed one of them to the glass with
many larvae, and the other to that with a few. Each of
them took a larva, carried it to the nest along the respec-
tive tapes, returned for another, and so on. After each
journey he put another larva in the glass with a few larvae
to replace the one which was taken away. Every new
ant which came to either of the glasses was imprisoned
till the end of the experiment. Such being the condi-
tions, it was observed that no ants went along the tape
bridge to the empty glass, 104 ants went to the glass with
a few larva?, and 304 to the glass with the many larvae. Thus it seems that the two original (marked) ants were
able to tell their companions, not only where larvae were
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to be found, but even where the largest store was to be
met with.
Concerning the powers of special sense, a large number
of experiments proved that ants are able to appreciate

stained glass, analysis of some of these experiments
showed that there had congregated "under the red 890,
under the green 544, under the yellow 495, and under the
violet only 5." Other experiments showed that red light
was the same to them as darkness, or, at least, that about
the same proportion of ants congregated under red glass
as congregated under a slip of porcelain. With reference
to the parts of the spectrum invisible to our eyes, other
experiments proved "that the limits of vision of ants at
the red end of the spectrum are approximately the same
as ours, that they are not sensitive to the ultra-red rays;
but, on the other hand, that they are very sensitive to the
ultra-violet rays." A layer of sulphate of quinine or of
bisulphide of carbon had the effect, as might be supposed
from the latter statement, of rendering the ultra-violet
rays invisible, or less obnoxious to the ants. Conversely,

Only one chapter of the book is devoted to bees, and
one other to wasps. These, however, are very interesting,
as the following rtsum/ will show :
Numerous observations went to prove "that bees do not
bring their friends to share any treasure they have dis-
covered so invariably as might be assumed from the state-
ments of previous writers ;" and also that in general
bees are rather stupid in finding their way to honey out of
rooms, &c. Their affection and sympathy is even less
developed than in ants, so that Sir John doubts " whether
they are in the least fond of one another." Their special
senses are much the same as those of ants, hearing being
to all appearance absent, while smell and sight are well
developed, the latter enabling the insects to distinguish
differences of colour on coloured surfaces. They prefer

All these remarks apply to the experiments on wasps
no less than to those on bees, except that they arc some-
what more clever in finding their way, and show less
preference for certain colours. One individual wasp was
tamed, used to perch upon the hand, "apparently ex-
pecting to be fed," and even allowed herself to be stroke.1
without any appearance of alarm.
We have now said as much as our space peimits to
recommend this work to all who take an interest in one
of the most interesting branches of natural history. We
can only find two points on which to offer criticism. Over
a hundred pages are occupied with appendices, conveying
minute details of the observations and experiments men-
tioned in the previous part of the work. These details
appetr to us unnecessary in a popular book, and we
think that the space filled by them might have been more
profitably devoted to a well compressed abstract of the
observations of other naturalists upon the psychology of
the hymenoptera.
The second point, which seems to us fairly open to
criticism, is that concerning the author's views on the
philosophy of vision. He discusses the theories of vision
by simple and compound eyes of insects, and says, " The
prevailing opinion of entomologists now is that each facet
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
receives the impression cf one pencil of rays; so that, in
fact, the image formed by a compound eye is a sort of
mosaic," and proceeds to observe that this theory "pre-
sents great difficulties," because "those ants which have
very few facets must have an extremely imperfect vision,''
and also because the ants have simple eyes as well as
compound, so that, according to the theory, the former
ca^t reversed images, and the latter directa considera-
tion which leads Sir John to remark, "that the same
animal should see some things directly, and others re-
versed, and yet obtain definite conceptions of the outer
world, would certainly be very remarkable."
Now, as regards the first objection, the perfection or
imperfection of the vision would not necessarily be deter-
mined by the number of the facets any more than by
their size. If a given area or eye-space is throughout a
receptive surface, it need make no difference whether the
area is composed of a few facets or of many; the perfec-
tion or imperfection of the apparatus as an eye would in
either case depend on the distinctness or definition with
which a pencil of rays is admitted into each facet, whether

perhaps, for the purpose of looking at the illustrative

Both these works are elementary: their scope is in the

for the army. Mr. Lock's is by far the fuller work, and
is well adapted for a student who has not constantly at

hand the assistance of a private tutor; in fact, such a
reader, if of fair intelligence, might be independent of
extraneous aid, if he have previously grounded himself
carefully in geometry and elementary algebra. The work
contains a very large collection of good (and not too hard)
examples. The only faultif we must grumbleis that
there is too much, we think, for ordinary school teaching.
As Mr. Vyvyan remarks, " in all public schools but a few
hours a week can be given to mathematics by the gene-
rality of boys," and trigonometry has to take, in general,
a very small portion of that limited time. But Mr. Lock
is to be congratulated, when so many " Trigonometries"
are in the field, on having produced so good a book, for
he has not merely availed himself of the labours of his
predecessors, but by his treatment of a well-worn subject
has invested the study of it with interest. The figures
are numerous, and are drawn so that the salient features
arrest the eye at once.
Mr. Vyvyan's work also is well adapted to the end he
has in view. He aims at producing a book which may
fairly be mastered by any schoolboy of average ability,
whose sole desire in studying this branch (or any other
branch of mathematics) is to satisfy the University ex-
aminers in an early stage of residence, that so he may
be free to read other subjects, and bid farewell to

mathematics.
The matter is clearly, though somewhat concisely put,
and is sufficient in quantity for Mr. Vyvyan's purpose,
which is not to bring out a book that will render a school-
boy or other junior student independent of the assistance of
a masterthis he considers to be an impossible task. We
ourselves have found that very much explanation is re-
quired by the generality of pupils. There is a sufficient
collection and variety of exercises.
We cannot say that either text-book will supersede all
other text-books, but each merits, and will no doubt
secure a very fair circulation in schools. Mr. Lock's
being the fuller, is likely to be the more generally
acceptable.

Earth-Tremors in Japan
An article on earth-tremors, which appeared in the Times last
November, seems to have attracted considerable attention in Japan,
and a few facts respecting the work which has been attempted in the
investigation of niieroseismic disturbances in this country, may
possibly be of interest. In the Transactions of the Seismolugical
Society of Japan we have already had three communications on
this subject. Prof. II. M. Paul told us how, when searching
for a site for the United States Naval Observatory at Washington,
by watching Hie reflection of the image of a star in a vessel of
mercury with a telescope, he was easily enabled to detect earth-
tremors pi-educed by a railway train at the distance of a mile.
. Major II. S. Talmer, R.E., of Hong Kong, gave us an
account of how, by digging a trench large enough to contain

himself and his in-trunieirs when seeking for a station from
which to make observations on the Transit of Venus, he practi-
cally escaped from eanh-tremors which emanated from a railway
line about 400 yards distant. As there are strong reasi ns for
believing that many of the earthquakes which are felt in \ edo
are produced by the faulting of the rocks, it was natural to
as-umethat before the actual breakage took place there n.igM be
a crackling or gradual giving way which would be indicated to
»s by preceding earth-tremors.
In order to determine the presence of these earth-tremors, at
the er.d of 1879 I commenced a series of experiments with a
variety of apparatus, amongst which were microphones and sets
of pendulum apparatus, very similar in general arrangement,
but, unfortunately, not in refinement of construction, to the
arrangements now being used in the Cavendish Laboratory.
The microphones were screwed on to the heads of stakes
driven in the ground, at the bottom of boxed-in pits. In order
to be certain that the records which these microphones gave
were not due to local actions, such as birds or in-eccs, two dis-
tinct sets of apparatus were used, one being in the middle of the
lawn in the front of my house, and the other in a pit at the back

Limulus
Concerning the systematic place of Limulus, I should like
to draw attention to a habit which has, as far as I know, never
been alluded to in discussions, viz. the manner of casting its
skin, mentioned by me in Deformation of Insects [Man. Comfar.
Zoology). Limulus splits the skin exactly around the front margin
of the head. Among Crustacea the Decapods at least split the
skin around the hind margin of the carapace. Insects split the
skin in the longitudinal middle line of the occiput and thorax,
with the later addition of a transversal split on the head. I
have seen cast skins of Scorpio, Pseudoscorpions, Hydrachna,
and Arachnids, but they are not now at hand for a sure verifi-
cation. As far as I remember all of them split the skin in the
middle line of the anterior parts. At least I do not remember
to have seen any transversal anterior split. H. A. Hagen

Dr. C. J. Macgowan has sent me from Han Chow, Province
of Hain-n, China, a little paper on the "Utilisation of Ants as
Insect Destroyers in China." It seems that in many parts of
the province of Canton the orange trees are injured by certain
worms, and to rid themselves from these pests, the inhabitants
import ants from the neighbouring hills. The hill-people
throughout the summer and winter find the nests of two species
of ants, red and yellow, suspended from the branches of various
trees. The "orange ant breeders" are provided with pig or
goat bladders baited inside with lard. The orifices of these they
apply to the entrance of the bag-like nests, when the ants enter
the bladders, and, as Dr. Macgowan expresses it, "become a
marketable commodity at the orangeries." The trees are
colonised by placing the ants on their upper nranches, and
bamboo rods are stretched between the different trees, so as to
give the ants easy access to the whole orchard. This remedy has
been in constant use at least since 1640, and probably dates from
a much earlier peri' d. This is certainly a new way of utilising
ants, which as a rule are deservedly considered a nuisance by
the horticulturist. I should like to learn from any entomological
reader of Nature whether the facts communicated have before
been known in Europe, and, if so, whether the species of ant
has been determined. C. V. Riley

subject. Since that time a host of enthusiastic observers
has arisen over Europe, and innumerable examples of
"cups and circles" have been discovered and described.
It is difficult to account for the fascination that allures
men to the study and pursuit of these "pitted stones."
They are neither beautiful, nor intrinsically valuable.
They are often earth-fast boulders, too large for transport,
and unsuitable for " collections." But there is an element
of mystery about them, and the mysterious is often more
attractive than the beautiful or the useful. They piqne
the curiosity of the ordinary observer by the obvious sug-
gestion that they have a story to tell if they could be
made to speak; and they whet the ardour of the scientific
investigator by the equally obvious suggestions that they
are the products of a definite human purpose, which may
be discoverable from an examination and comparison of
their special characteristics. Probably no series of
archaeological remains has been more carefully examined,

nature of the purpose or purposes for which they were
produced it cannot fail to add largely to the extent and
precision of our knowledge of an essentially obscure
subject.
It is certainly a matter of great interest, whatever may
prove to be its general significance, that "cup-stones"
and " pitted stone«," which are in many cases analogous
to those in the Eastern Hemisphere, are found in the
United States and other parts of the Western Continent.
Perhaps the most remarkakable of those found in the
United States is one at Ironton, in Lawrence County,
Ohio, which was first brought to the notice of European
archaeologists by Prof. Daniel Wilson, in the Proceedings
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland for June, 1875.
It is a boulder of grey sandstone 3 feet long, 2 feet 7 inches
wide, and a foot and a half high, weighing between 1000
and 1200 pounds. The surface of the stone is pitted all
over by about 116 cups, whose average diameter is i£
inches and their depth about \ inch, and on one side of
the block there are several grooves 4 or 5 inches long,
shallow and circularly hollowed in the bottom, so that "a
cylindrical stone applied in the direction of its length
would have produced the grooves, and its end by rotation
the cup-shaped cavities." Another cupped boulder of

granite occurs at Niantic, in New London County, Con-
necticut. It has only six cups, varying from about 2 inches
to 3k inches diameter, and from \ inch to almost 1 inch in
depth. Mr. Rau does not notice a still more remarkable
boulder of granite in Forsyth County, Georgia, 9 feet
long, 44 feet high, and 3 feet wide, of which Prof. Wilson
has given a figure. Along one side of the boulder is a
row of cups, eighteen in number, connected by an incised
line or gutter, while the face of the boulder is covered
with markings of single or double concentric circles, sur-
rounding small cups in the centre. In some cases two of
these circles are connected by a straight gutter. Two
very large boulders on the bank of the Ohio, a few miles
below Manchester, in Adams County, have been seen by
Dr. Hill, but are not more precisely described than that
they are of sandstone, the one having twenty-nine and
the other thirty-seven cups. A large cupped boulder at

almost impossible. The ornamental theory is negatived
by the fact that they occur so often in situations in which
they cannot be seen, as for instance on the under sides of
cist-covers. The commemorative theory admits of much
being said in its favour, but fails to suit all the circum-
stances of the case. The theory that they fulfilled some
purpose in relation to the religious observances of pre-
historic man is perhaps the most plausible that has yet
been suggested, and has the following arguments in its
favour.
If this early system of sculpturing these enigmatic
markings on rocks and stones originally had reference to
a common idea connected with the religious observances
of prehistoric times, the existence of some traces of this
connection might reasonably be looked for in the super-
stitions of the area in which it was formerly prevalent.
This, in point of fact, is found to be the case. In many
parts of Sweden, these cup-marked boulders are known
as elf-stenar, and are still believed by the common people
to possess curative powers. They say prayers, and make
vows at them, anoint the cups with fat (usually hog's

lard), place offerings of pins and small copper coins in
them, and when they are sick, they make small dolls or
images of rags, to be laid in them. These facts are stated
in the Manadsbladof the Swedish Academy of Science.
Miss Mestorf, as quoted by Mr. Rau, is more explicit ;
"The elfs are the souls of the dead; they frequently
dwell in or below stones, and stand in various relations
to the living. If their quiet is disturbed, or their dwell-
ing-place desecrated, or if due respect is not paid to
them, they will revenge themselves by afflicting the per-
petrators with diseases or other misfortunes. For this
reason, people take care to secure the favour of the
'little ones' by sacrifices, or to pacify them when
offended. Their claims are very modest: a little butter
or grease, a copper coin, a flower, or ribbon, will satisfy
them. If they have inflicted disease, some object worn
by the sick person, such as a pin, or button, will reconcile
them. A Swedish proprietor of an estate in Uppland,
who had caused an elf-stone to be transported to his
park, found, a few days afterwards, small sacrificial gifts
lying in the cups. In the Stockholm Museum are pre-
served rag dolls, which had been found upon an elf-
stone."
These superstitious practices are connected with actual
cup-stones of prehistoric times, but there are others, for

the practice of which cups have been made in modern
times. In the Proceedings of the Berlin Anthropological
Society for June, 1875, Dr. Veckenstedt called attention
to the existence of cup-markings on the walls of the
church of Cottbus, in Brandenburg. Since then, they
have been discovered on the walls of churches in more
than twenty different localities in Prussia, and also in
Germany and Switzerland, and even in Sweden. They
are usually on the southern side of the churches, near
an entrance, and not be)ond the height of a man's arm.
According to some accounts, in Germany at least, the
cups were believed to possess healing virtues, chiefly
for charming away fevers, and in some instances these
modern cups in the church walls have been anointed
with grease, like the cups in the prehistoric elf-stenar of
Sweden. In Posen a tradition refers to the cups on the
church-walls as the work of damned souls who ground
them out in the night-time.

its place in scientific history by the side of many other
out-of-the-world places, which seem to be chiefly affected
by eclipses, and its memory may still puzzle the dryasdusts
of the future.
As the 17th approached the excitement of almost every-
body visibly increased, and as the energy waned the
tension waxed. A little wind eddy of fearful violence,
which produced a small sand-storm on the land, and
almost a waterspout as it tore its way out of sight across
the Nile, after hurling down one of the French tents and
driving the dahabeeah occupied by the English party
from its moorings, was almost a relief; and a further
variety was introduced into the monotony of heat and
work by the arrival of the dahabeeahs and the final visit
of the Governor-General to the astronomers and his new
visitors, Aly Pacha Cherif (son of Cherif Pacha, Minister
of Mohamet Aly); Osman Pacha Caleb, Governor-General
of Assiout; Mahmoud Pacha, director of the Cairo Ob-

interpreter, and the final arrangements for the eventful
day were made. First among these the military guard
had to be largely strengthened, for not only is a very
pardonable curiosity a thing to be utterly suppressed
during eclipses, but a whisper had gone abroad that the
False Prophet of the Soudan had included the eclipsers in
his anathemas, and even one fanatic in the camp at Sohag
might give a deal of trouble. And at last the 17th came,
ushered in by the finest morning we had had(clouds had
been terribly persistent for several previous days at the
time the eclipse was to happen)and when the observers

four critical points: the first, second, third, and fourth
contacts, so calledthe first when the moon makes its
appearance on the sun, the second when its first totality

certain definite positions will tell us what substances are
present. Now, in 1871 rings were seen, and they were
very bright. In 1878 no ring whatever was seen. The
question to be decided, then, was, Did this year's eclipse resemble in this respect the eclipse of 1871 or 1878? The
result of the inquiry was that there were rings, but that
they took time to see. This indicated a solar condition
more resembling that presented in 1871 than in 1878, but
stopping short of it.
Owing to these difficulties, hardly had Mr. Lockyer
time to pass back to the telescope by means of which the
spectrum of the corona was to be studied, when the clock
showed that sixty-five seconds had elapsed, and Mr.
Buchanan's "over" filled all with regret that the pheno-
menon, so rare and beautiful, and full of such precious
knowledge, which each was doing hia "level best" to
secure, should be so ephemeral. So the caps were put on
the cameras by Dr. Schuster and his assistant, Mr.
Woods, lest the precious records which it was hoped
might have been secured thould be spoiled by the first
beam of the reappearing sun. It turned out, however,
that so admirably had the eclipse been calculated, and so

exactly had the French party hit upon the central line,
that the totality really lasted 7 seconds more, that is, the
full 72 seconds. The spectrum of the corona, therefore,
was studied for a second or two under, perhaps, better
conditions than had ever been present before, excepting
during the memorable observation of Janssen in 1871.
There were the red and green and blue lines stretching
right across a wide field of view, and although no obvious
dark lines were seen in the momentary glimpse, it was
obvious that the spectrum was not truly a continuous
one. There were variations of intensity here and there,
and not the equal toning generally observed. So then
ended the totality in one of the observatories. Dr.
Schuster and his assistants at once proceeded to the ex-
temporised dark room on board the steamer to develop
the photographs, while those members of all the parties
who had made telescopic or spectroscopic observations
retired to the solitude of their tents to write down their
results while they were still fresh in their minds.
Later on in the day there was a conference, at which
the collective note, which I have already telegraphed to
you, was drawn up and signed on behalf of the several
expeditions. The observations were thought then, and
are thought now, to have been a splendid success. The
photographic results obtained by Capt. Abney's rapid

plates have secured permanent records of the highest
value, which largely increase our knowledge of the sun's
atmosphere. They connect the spectrum of the sun with
that of the stars in a most unmistakable manner; and,
taken in connection with the observations of Lockyer
and Tre"pied on the bright lines visible before totality
observations predicted a year ago in the teeth of received
opinionshow that those who would explain solar phe-
nomena in the light of terrestrial chemistry have their
work cut out for them. But on this and on some other
matters I may hive something to say in a subsequent
letter.

oscillation of Nordenskjold's "glory" independence on
the seasons. Another, diurnal oscillation, according to
which the auroral belt would slowly advance towards the
north (for Godthaab) during the night, seems very
probable. It would explainM. Tromholt says--the
greater intensity of aurora; towards midnight, as well as
the greater frequency of northern aurora; among those
which were observed at Godthaab during the morning;
but this 11st phenomenon, of course, might depend also
upon some diurnal variation of the intensity of the
"common arc." In any case, these conclusions are to
be considered as provisory ones, and must be submitted
to the further test of observations carried on at points
more favourably situated than Godthaab for the study of
these oscillations. Such is also the opinion of M.
Tromholt himself.
Of course, the fifteen years' observations at Godthaab
do not include a period of time sufficiently long for
enabling us to deduce from them the laws of periodicity
of auroiie. But still they allow of several interesting con-
clusions which may serve as a guidance for further re-

searches. Thus, it appears from themcontrary to what
was said as to the aurora; being more frequent during the
most cloudy daysthat the number of observed aurora;
is directly proportionate to the brightness of the sky.
This dependence appears not only for different years or
months, but also for separate days. If all the days when
auror;e were observed are classified according to their
brightness, which is expressed by the figures 1 to 4, and
the brightness compared with the average number of
aurora; observed during the days thus classified, we see
that while the quantity of clouds was i"6, 17, 1 S, I"8 ...
3'*. 3'3> 3 4, and 35. the average corresponding number
of auroras was 70, 7'o, 5-0, 5-0 ... 29, 27, 35, and 15,
the decrease being altogether very regular, so as to leave
little doubt as to the accuracy of the law.
The following data have some bearing on the 11J ) ears*
period of aurone which was deduced from observations
in more southern latitudes, and which is considered as
depending upon the amount of solar spots. Reckoning the
years from August to May, so as to comprise in each year
all autumn, winter, and spring aurora; during the bright
nights of the summer they are not observable), the yearly
number of auroras during the years 1865-66 to 1879-80 is
given by M. Tromholt as follows:97, 112, 65,84,45,

irregular. Nevertheless, it is easy to perceive in these
figures a certain periodicity with three maxima corre-
sponding to the years 1866-67, 1876-77, and 1878-79. By
introducing a correction which depends upon the bright-
ness of the sky, and reducing the observed number of
aurora; to an average cloudiness, M. Tromholt finds
another series which is more in accordance with the
number of solar spots as given by Wolf. Both series
for the years 1865-66 to 1879-80 (August to May), appear
as follows :
Number of aurora, -with corrtctitn for brightness of sky

It would seem from these two series, that instead of
being proportionate to the number of solar spots, the
number of auroras is rather inversely proportionate to
this number, the two maxima of aurora; corresponding
with the two minima of solar spots, and the minimum of

Deer also belongs to the American group of the Cervidte,
but has some special peculiarities, and together with an
allied formthe Andean Deer (Furci/cr anlisiensis) 
constitutes a small and distinct section of the American
Deer, remarkable for the simple character of the bifurcated
antlers.
The Chilian Deer is generally known to the natives of
Chili as the "Guemul," and, though but slightly devia-
ting from the ordinary deer in general appearance, has
been strangely misunderstood by some of the older
authors. Molina, in his work [on the Natural History of
Chili, classed it as a horse (!) under the name Equus
bisuleus, while Hamilton Smith has referred it to the

I Llamas, and other authors to the Camels! Gay, in his
j "Fauna Chilena," published in 1847, first gave a clear
1 account of this animal, and figured the female in the
accompanying "Atlas," from a specimen in the Museum
of Santiago. Gay tells us it is rare in Chili, being only
met with in the Cordilleras of the southern provinces. Mr.
E. C. Reed, who sent a skin and skull of the "Huernul"
for exhibition before the Zoological Society in 1875,' tells
us that several specimens of it have of late years been
procured by the Chilian vessels engaged in exploring the
Chonos Archipelago, and that it extends throughout
Patagonia down to Sandy Point, in the Straits of
Magellan.
The Chilian Deer is of about the size of a large roe-
deer, but much stouter and thicker in its limbs. The
antlers of the male, as will be seen by the illustration
(Fig. 21), are very simple in character, consisting of a
Fig. 22. the K.l-ii.ued CiroL.li--Cu'.k )
well-developed beam provided with a single anterior snag
or brow antler, which curves rapidly upwards, and
attains nearly an equal length with the beam itself.
The example of this rare deer in the Zoological
Society's collection was received from the Jardin d'Ac-
climatation of Paris in December last, and is believed to
be the only individual of the species ever brought alive to

22. The Radiated Ground-Cuckoo {Carpoccccyx radia-
tus).To the minds of most people the name cuckoo con-
veys only the idea of a tree-loving bird of strong flight, that
utters a well-known cry and drops its eggs in other birds'
nests. But the Cuckoo family (Cuculidae) of naturalists
is an extensive group, containing many birds which not
only have neither cuckoo-like call nor parasitic habits,
but differ greatly from our familiar summer visitor both
in structure and in manner of life. No better instance
can be given of this truth than the very remarkable bird
which we now figure (Fig. 23) from an example living in
the Zoological Society's "Insect House.".-_ Though a
"cuckoo" in all the essential points of its conformation,
it is a purely terrestrial bird with a pair of long and
strong legs, and in its general gait and actions much more
nearly resembles a pheasant or a rail than the ordinary
cuckoo of this country, with which it claims relationship.
The Radiated Ground-Cuckoo was first made known to
science in 1832, by Temminck, who described and figured
it in one of the livraisons of his "Planches Coloriees,"

»34
{June 8, 1882
NATURE
Our great countryman, Mr. Wallace, who, we believe,
met with this ground-cuckoo in Sarawak, also speaks of
its terrestrial habits, and states that its mode of life
resembles that of the pheasants of the genus Euplocamus.
Litde else appears to have been recorded respecting this
cuckoo, which is certainly one of the most peculiar forms
of bird-life that have of late years been exhibited in the
Zoological Society's aviaries.
On examining the specimen in question, which, when
it first arrived, had only a half-grown tail, but is now in
excellent plumage, it will be at once observed that the
naked space round the eye has been incorrectly coloured
in Temminck's figure of this species. Instead of being of a red colour as there represented, it is of a nearly uni-
form pale green, as is likewise the bill. Few non-pro-
fessional ornithologists, indeed, would recognise a cuckoo
in the pheasant-like ground-loving bird with large bright
bill, which is labelled in the Zoological Society's Gardens
"The Radiated Ground-Cuckoo."

Prof. Bjerknes of Christiania exhibited his remarkable
experiments with little drums or tambours vibrating under
water, and attracting or repelling each other according as
the phase of the pulsations was like or unlike. An
account of his results was published in Nature, vol. xxiv.
p. 361, and the analogy between them and the well-known
effects of magnetism was there drawn attention to. The
field opened up by Prof. Bjerknes has been entered
by Mr. Augustus Stroh, a well-known member of
the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electri-
cians, who recently delivered a lecture on his re-
searches. Mr. Stroh has gone over the experiments
of Dr. Bjerknes in air as a medium for propagating the
pulsations of the drums instead of water, and has ad-
vanced beyond his predecessor in further experiments on
the same line. The beauty of the apparatus and methods
devised by him, and the exquisite skill with which he
manipulated them, elicited the unanimous admiration of
his hearers.
The drums employed by Mr. Stroh were small shells
of wood having their mouths covered by an elastic mem-
brane and their rears communicating with a flexible pipe,
through which the pulsating air was communicated to the
membrane, so that it could cause the latter to bulge out
or collapse at every wave of air. The source of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
vibrations was a vibrating reed, against which the air
was forced by a small hand-bellows shaped like an
accordion. By employing a flexible forked tube with
arms of equal length, each fitted with a drum at the end,
the vibratory air-blast from the reed could be conveyed
to the drums so as to set them vibrating in like phase;
and when one of the drums was mounted on a vertical
axis, and free to rotate round it like the pole of a balanced
magnetic needle, the approach of the other drum to it
resulted in an attraction between them which was very
pronounced. In this case the drums were vibrating in
like phase, that is to say, they both bulged out and bulged
in simultaneously. The mechanical explanation of the
attraction is that there is a rarefaction of the air between
the drums produced by the simultaneous advance and
recession of the membranes toward each other. This
rarefaction occasions a difference of pressure between
the front and backs of the drums, causing them to move
towards each other.
When, however, the vibrations are in opposite phase,
that is to say, when one drum bulges out while the other

arrived at. By a series of test experiments he demon-
strated that the lines of pressure in the air between the
two drums are practically identical in direction with those
which Faraday revealed to us in the magnetic field by
means of iron filings. These were investigated by ex-
ploring the field between the drums with a small taper
flame and noting the direction of the blast, as well as
with a small windmill mounted on a stand, but the action
of both these explorers requires a still atmosphere, and
therefore could not be shown to a large audience. Mr. Stroh
however, had devised a means of showing the movements
of the air by models of the drums vibrating in glycerine
traversed by the electric light which threw an image of
the drums upon a screen. The membranes of the drums
were oscillated in this case by working a crank and pulley,
and four star-like water-wheels were pivoted between
them in such a manner that when the drums were vibrated
the wheels revolved under the streaming of the glycerine
caused by the vibrations of the drums. Aniline blue
placed in the glycerine at the middle of the surfaces of
the drums also indicates the stream lines of the fluid to
an audience. Starting from the middle, the glycerine

separating into two trails, curved outwards into a kind of
volute. This happened at both membranes, so that
the space between was filled up by four such curves having
a diamond space between them. This effect was pro-
duced by unlike phase, and closely resembled the arrange-
ment of lines seen when two like magnetic poles are
opposed to each other. On the other hand, the stream
lines produced by vibrations in like phase were much less
complex, and resembled the lines of force crossing over
between two unlike magnetic poles.

The tide of travel, with insects, as with men, seems naturally
to be from east to west. With the noted exception of the grape
phylloxera and the Colorado potato beetle (as Miss Murthly
points out in a paper to the St. Louis Academy), Europe has not
received from America any considerable pest, while innumerable
noxious species have crossed the Atlantic from Europe. There
is a comparative scarcity, too, of Asiatic insect species on the
western seaboard of America, notwithstanding frequent ocean
traffic. Spite of great arid plains and lofty mountains, nearly
all the insects of Eastern American States, including those from
Europe, have found their way to the fields, orchards, and vine-
yards of the Pacific States. One of the latest insect-invaders
from Europe is the cabbage or rape-butterfly (Pieiis rjf<e,
Schrank). It appeared about twelve years ago in some northern
seaports, and its range now extends from far north in Canada to
the south of Georgia. It attacks every cruciferous garden vege-
table, but in the flower garden curiously rejects plants of that
family in favour of mignonette. Miss Murthlyhas noted a large

amount of premature emergence from the chrysalis, and conse-
quent death ; indicating imperfect adjustment of the insect to the
climate of its new habitat. In Europe the insect is mainly kept
in check by numerous parasites. For several years in America
none such came to the aid of the disheartened gardener, but
some have now appeared, the most important being a small,
metallic green fly, which, though identical with the most de-
structive European parasite, is proved to be indigenous on
both sides of the Atlantic. It lays its eggs in or upon the skin
of the mature caterpillar, and from these come small maggots, which live on the fatty tissues of their victim, but do not touch
its vital organs till the chrysalis state is reached.
The mines opened a short time since in China in the province
of Chihli, with the special support and patronage of Li Hung
Chang, have recently become the subject of much adventitious
interest in Europe. The working of these mines was wholly a
native enterprise; foreign machinery was imported in large
quantities, and up to a month or two ago all seemed going on
well. A canal between the mines and Tientsin was nearly com-
pleted, and it was calculated that 250 tons of fine coal could be
forwarded daily to the latter port. Five thousand tons were, it
was said, ready at the pit's mouth for conveyance as soon as the
canal was opened. It was believed that, with sufficient transport,
one thousand tons a day could be raised for many years from the
present pits, while it was said that fifty collieries of an equal size
to the present one could be opened in or near Kaiping. The

information, therefore, telegraphed by Reuter's agent in Shanghai
that the further working of the mines had been peremptorily
stopped by the Government, came with a shock to many in-
terested in progress in China. It was stated that a censor in a
memorial to the throne complained that the long galleries in the
mines, and the smoke of the foreign machinery, disturbed the
earth dragon, who in his turn disturbed the spirit of the Empress(
who died some months ago, and who was buried about a hundred
miles off. The irate spirit of the departed lady promptly took
vengeance by afflicting the denizens of the palace in Peking with
measles. The latter were, the censor is reported to have said,
distinctly traceable to the Kaiping mines, which interfered with
XhefeHg-sAui. The conclusion was obvious: the mines must be
stopped. Such was the story told by the Tientsin correspondent
of a Shanghai newspaper. The process by which a suggestion
that the mines should be stopped grew in the excited minds of
the residents of Shanghai into the certainty that they were
actually stoppedand thus to Reuter's telegramis not an
unfamiliar one. The latest information from the East enables
us to say that the mines are still working as usual, and there is
not the slightest evidence that there is or has been any intention

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN The Comet (1882 a).In a circular issued from Lord Craw-
f<>ra'.s Observatory on May 29, Dr. Copeland remarks that the
spectrum of the nucleus of the present comet deserved the
closest attention, as it showed "a sharp bright line coincident
vith D, as well as strong traces of other bright lines, resembling
in appearance those seen in the spectra of 7 Cassiopeia: and
allied stars." For some weeks the head had exhibited white
light, which might be inherent in the comet or the reflected light
of the sun; on May 28 the nucleus began to throw out yellow
rays, which on June I were also given out by parts of the tail
immediately behind the head. Of 7 Cassiopeia;, Secchi writing
in 1877, says: "Le plus rcmarquabledeces etoiles exceptionelles

J. W. BRUHL, from the results of determinations of molecular
refractions of many carbon compounds, concluded that the
atomic refraction of carbon varies according as the atoms of
carbon are tetravalent, divalent, or monovalent (singly, doubly,
or trebly "linked "), in the molecule under consideration. In
calculating molecular refractions, Biiihl used the empirical
expression I*M; Landult has recently re-calculated the
ratios ot many molecular refractions by the use of the formula

In their researches on ozone, MM. Chappuis and Hautefeuille have made use of the spectroscope to trace the progress of the
chemical change which occurs when oxygen, or a mixture of
oxygen and nitrogen, is subjected to the action of the electric
discharge. They find that ozone is characterised by a distinct
absorptive spectrum, the prominent bands in which are two in
nu'ober situated in the neighbourhood of D. The same bands
are prominent in the absorptive spectrum of liquid ozone.
MM. Chappuis and Hautefeuille also find that the

charge on a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen increases to a
maximum, then decreases to a minimum, then again increase-,
and so on; by the aid of the spectroscopic method they trace
this oscillation to the formation and decomposition of an oxide
of nitrogen not hitherto observed, which they propose to call
pernitric oxide (acide pernitrijuc) (Compi. rind., xciv. 858 and
mi).
The Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, the fourth
number of which is now before us, promises to be of very great
service to all who are interested in chemical manufactures. The
present number of the journal contains papers read before the
Society on "Smoke Abatement," "The Chemical Technology
of Jute Fibre," "The loss of Sulphuric Acid in the Manufacture

technical applications of chemistry and chemical physics, and
very useful classified abstracts of recent patents complete the

In the last number of the Birichte of the German Chemical
Society (xv. 1161) HH. v. Meyer and H. Goldschmidt describe
an apparatus by means of which the specific gravities of gases
may be determined at very high temperatures. The apparatus
concists of a cylindrical porcelain tube 500 or 600 mm. in length,
capacity about 100c.c, furnished with a capillary tube of about
2O0C.C. long at each end. The apparatus is heated, the air is
driven out by an inert gas, e.g. by nitrogen, the gas whose

specific gravity is required is allowed to enter the appa'atus, and
the weight of this gas is determined by driving it out, by means
of an inert gas, into some liquid by which it is completely ab-
sorbed. The temperature may be calculated from the ratio
between the volume of air contained in the apparatus under the
conditions of the experiment and the volume contained at the
ordinary temperature of the room. By the use of this apparatus
the authors have determined that the density of cyanogen is
norma] [i.e. corresponds with the formula C2N,) between 100° and 800°, but that at 12000 this gas is decomposed with evolution
of nitrogen.
PHYSICAL NOTES
A NEW method of comparing the brightness of different
coloured lights has been proposed by Herr Briicke (ll'ien. Ber.,
84). He finds that objects cease to be visible at a greater visual
angle, the more they differ from the background on which they
are seen, only in colour and not in brightness. If a board be
set up, which is black at one end and white at the other, with
successive shades of grey between (a brightness-table), one may
determine the brightness, e.g. of a coloured paper, by placing a
piece of it before different parts of the board, and noting the
place where, with shortest interval, it becomes invisible. This

on the nature of the motion. A ra| idl> rotated haft has an
adjutable eccentric with jointed rod, which at each rotation
pulls a lar^e drum-.-kin to and fro. A bell-mouth strengthens
and o m Citrates the tones. The velocity of rotation determines
the picli; the eccei.tricity the strength of the tones. The
phi/tiomotoi acts on the opposite principle, rotatory motion being
got from vibration. In the electromagnetophone a piece of sheet- iron under an tlectr. magnet has a point dipping in mercury; a
currtir pas-ing through the coils and the point becomes readily
intern.iiten', and the membrane sounds. The electromagnetic
memiiane-tiitn is similar, but a solid sliding contact takes the

tion. Again, a tuning-fork is supported so as to be capable of
rotation before a resonance-case. According to position it gives
a strong resonance or a weak interference tone, the latter slightly
higher. On rotating, the former becomes lower, the latter
higher, and the dissonance ever greater. A resonance-inter-

Continuing his researches on "adsorption," or condensation
of gases on surfaces of sol.ds. Heir Kayser (Wild. Ann. No. 4)
has -iudied the influence of the adsorbing material. The pres-
sure was determined, which occurred in the glass vessel when
given volumes of gas had been in contact with the solid mate-
rial. The gases were carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, and
ammonia, and these were adsorbed in the empty glass vessel, by
coarse glass powder, and by turnings of brass and wrought iron.
'1 be metal-turnings were quite clean and unoxidised, and before
each experiment they were heated in vacuo to about 300°, to
remove gas. It was found that pressure was greatest, and so
ad-orption least, in the empty ves el. 'Ihe or^er of increasing
a' sorption was, in general : empty vessel, iron, brass, and glass
powder. By the empty vessel, SO, was least condensed, CO,
and. NH, about equally. Also, on the metallic surfaces, S02
al« ays gave greater pie-sure ihan NH3; between CO, and SO,
there was hardly any difference. By the glas- surfaces, on the
cither ha.id, CO., was comparatively little condensed, NH3 con-
siderably, and SOj to a large extent.
The behaviour of mercury when polarised in contact with
dilute sulphuric acid (as in l.ippmann's well-known experiments),
and with other acids and salt solutions, has been studied by Herr
Konig at the instance of Prof. Helmholtz {Ir'red. Ann., No. 5).

The surface-tension, it is shown, reaches a maximum at a mean
state of polari-ation different- for different liquids; the values
diminishing on either side, as one removes from this, and both
with positive and negative charges. Prof. Helmholtz offers some
comments by way of theory on the phenomena.
From experiments at Wurzburg (H'icJ. Ann., No. 5), Mr.
William Hallock infers the correctness of the view that the
changes of electromotive force of the Smee element are due to
action of polarisation. The electromotive force of polarisation
is by no means independent (he affirms) of the nature of the
electrodes, and it considerably exceeds that necessary for visible
decomposition. The polarisation cannot be calculated from the
heat phenomena.
To find whether the two coefficients used in equations of
motion of incompressible liquidsone of viscosity, the other of
variable adherence of the liquid to the wallsare independent of
velocity, M. Elie (Jonrn. de Phys., May) rotates a solid sphere
within another filled with liquid, and hung bifilarly. Thesmaller
sphere (004 m. diameter) is supported by a metallic wire passing
through an aperture in the larger (012 m.) between the suspend-
ing wires to the vertical axis of an electric rotatory apparatus.

In the year ending May 20, 18S2, photographs of the sun

inequality of vertical force and its dependence on solar activity,
notwithstanding the great care taken to keep the magnetic base-
ment at as nearly uniform a temperature as possible. After
giving details as to rearrangements of the earth-current appa-
ratus, the report states that "on four days during the year,
viz., September 12 and 13 and April 16 and 19, magnetic
storms have occurred. Those of April we-e of more marked
character than any that have taken place since the great storms
of the year 1872, and it is a significant fact that exceptionally
large spots made their appearance on the sun shortly before,
viz., on April 11 and 17. Smaller magnetic movements are now
alsjmuch more frequent, the traces exhibiting a marked con-
trast to their general appearance some two or three years ago.
In regard to the long period variation of about 11 years, we are
able now to say definitely that the minimum as regards diurnal
range of declination occurred at the commencement of 1879,
whilst as regards diurnal range of horizontal force, it occurred
unmistakeably earlier, about August, 1878. Since the epochs
mentioned, each element has, with small fluctuations, continued
regularly to increase again in magnitude, the daily range of
declination having increased from 6''59 at the beginning of 1879
to 9''I5 in 1881, and that of horizontal force from -oono (in
parts of the whole H.F.) in 1878 to -00181 in 1881. We
have frequent applications from mining surveyors for the values
of the magnetic elements, and recently the wish has been

cated from time to time to the Colliery Guardian newspaper, in
order that mining surveys may be carried out with due allowance

"the mean temperature of the year 1881 was 48*"], being o°'6

air temperature was 97°'I on July 15, and the lowest I2°'7 on
January 17. The mean temperature was below the average,
6°-7 in January and 4°'8 in October, and above the average,
5°-9 in November. In other months the temperature in general

an explanation of the above phenomenon which seems to me

very likely t be the true one. On inquiring from Capt. Abney whether it had already been explained, he wrote: "The usual
explanation of the phenomenon you describe is that the silver
solution on the part of the plate on which the dark objects fall
has nowhere to deposit, and hence the metallic silver is dep >sited
to the nearest par' strongly acted upon by light." As this
expl mation seems to me to involve some difficulties, I venture to
offer another.
1. I will first mention the suggestive experiment, which is not
wholly uninteresting on its own account, as affording a pretty
illustration of what is already known, and furnishing an easy and
rapid mode of determining in a rough way the character of the
absorption of media for rays of low refrangibility.
The sun's light is reflected horizontally into a darkened room,
and passed through a lens,1 of considerable aperture for its focal length. A phosphorus is taken, suppose sulphide of calcium
giving out a deep blue light,'-' an t a position chosen for it which
may be varied at pleasure, but which I will suppose to be nearer
to the lens than its principal focus, at a place where a section of
the pencil passing through the lens by a plane perpendicular to
its axis shows the caustic surface well developed. A screen is
then placed to intercept the pencil passing through the lens, and
the phosphorus is exposed to sunlight or diffuse daylight, so as
to be uniformly luminous, and is then placed in position; the
screen is then removed for a very short time and then replaced,
and the effect on the phosphorus is observed.
Under the circumstances described there is seen a circular disk
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of blue light, much brighter than the general ground, where the
excitement of the phosphorus has been refreshed. This is sepa-
rated by a dark halo from the general ground, which shines by
virtue of the original excitement, not having been touched by the
rays which came through the lens.
2. The halo is due to the action of the less refrangible rays,
which, as is well known, discharge the phosphorescence. Their
first effect, as is also.known, is, however, to cause the phosphorus
to give out light; and if the exposure were very brief, or else the
intensity of the discharging rays were sufficiently reduced, the
part where they acted was seen to glow with a greenish light,
which faded much more rapidly than the deep blue, so that after
a short time it became relatively dark.
3. This change of colour of the phosphorescent light can
hardly fail to have been noticed, but I have not seen mention of
it. In this respect the effect of the admission of the discharging rays is quite different from that of warming the phosphorus,
which, as is known, causes the phosphorus to be brighter for a
time, and then to cease phosphorescing till it is excited afresh.
The difference is one which it seems important to bear in mind

have; a lens of flint glass would have been better, as giving more separation

acting along with the diffused light from all parts of the sky,
they did more harm than good. They behaved, in fact, like the
rays from the lamp in the experiment of Section 6. The slightly
inferior luminosity of the parts to some little distance on both
sides of that on which the shadow fell, shows that the loss of
the diffuse light corresponding to the portion of the sky cut off
by the pole w as quite sensible when that portion lay very near
the sun.
All this falls in very well with what we know of the nature of
the direct sunlight and the li^ht from the sky. In passing
through the atmosphere, the direct rays of the sun get ob-
structed by very minute particles of dust, globules of water
forming a haze too tenuous to be noticed, &c. The veil is
virtually coarser for blue than for red light, so that in the unim-
peded light the proportion of the rajs of low to those of high
refrangibility goes on continually increasing, the effect by the
time the rays reach the earth increasing as the >un j;ets lower,
and has accordingly a greater stretch of air to get through. Of
the light falling upon the obstructing particles, a portion might
be absorbed in the case of particles of very opaque substances,
but usually there would be little los- thi- way, and the greater
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
part would be diffused by reflection and diffraction. This dif-
fused light, in which there is a predominance of the rays of
higher refrangibility, would naturally be strongest in directions
not very far from that of the direct light ; and the loss accord-
ingly of a portion of it where it is Strauses', in consequence of
interception by the pole in front of the tablet, accounts for the
fact that the borders of the place of the shadow were seen to be
a little less luminous that the parts at a distance.
8. The observations on phosphorescence just described have
now prepared the way for the explanation I have to fuggest of
the photographic phenomenon.
It is known, that with certain preparations, if a plate be ex-
posed for a very short time to diffuse daylight, and be then
exposed to a pure spectrum in a dark room, on subsequently developing the image it is found, that while the more refrangible
rays have acted positively, that is, in the manner of light in
general, a certain portion of the less refrangible have acted in
an opposite way, having undone the action of the diffuse daylight
to which the plate was exposed in the first instance.
It appears then that in photography, as in phosphorescence,
there may in certain cases be an antagonistic action between the
more and less refrangible rays, so that it stands to reason that
the withdrawal of the latter might promote the effect of the
former.
Now the objective of a photographic camera is ordinarily
chemically corrected; that is to say, the minimum focal length
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
is made to lie, not in the brightest part of the spectrum, as in a
telescope, but in the part which has strongest chemical action.
What this is, depends more or less on the particular substance
acted on; but taking the preparations most usually employed, it
may be said to lie about the indigo or violet. Such an objective
would be much under-corrected for the red, which accordingly
would be much out of focus, a d the ultra-red still more so.
When such a camera is directed to a uniform bright object,
such as a portion of overcast sky, the proportion of the rays of
different refrangibilities to one another is just the same as if all
the colours were in focus together; but it is otherwise near the
edg<: of a dark object on a light ground. As regards the rays in
focu', there is a sharp transition from light to dark; but as
regards rays out of focus, the transition from light to dark,
though rapid, is continuous. It is, of course, more nearly
abrupt the more nearly the rays are in focus. Just at the out-
line of the object there would be half illumination as regards the
rays out of focus. On receding from the outline on the bright
side, the illumination would go on increasing, until on getting
to a distance equal to the radius of the circle of diffusion (from
being out of focus) of the particular colour under consideration,

these the hardness may be determined by the pressure which
must be exerted on a round surface, to exceed, by the deformation
produced, the limit of elasticity. In the case of plate-glass, e.g. it was found by experiment, that at a pressure of 136 kg. per
square mm., the limit was passed, and a circular crack was
produced; 136, accordingly, expresses the degree of hardness of
the glass. Every isotropic body which has exceeded its limit of

CHARLES DARWIN i-
IV.
IN attempting to estimate the influence which Mr.
Darwin's writings have exerted on the progress of
botanical science, a little consideration will show that we
must discriminate between the indirect effect which his
views have had on botanical research generally, and
the direct results of his own contributions. No doubt in
a sense the former will seem in the retrospect to over-
shadow the latter. For in his later writings Mr. Darwin
was content to devote himself to the consideration of
problemswith an insight and patience essentially his
ownwhich, in a limited field, brought his theoretical
views to a detailed test, and so may ultimately seem to be
somewhat merged in them. It is wonderful enough that
so great a master in biological science should, at an ad-
vanced age, have been content to work with all the fervour
and assiduity of youth at phenomena of vegetable life
apparently minute and of the most special kind. But to
him they were not minute, but instinct with a significance
that the professed botanical world had for the most part

missed seeing in them failing the point of view which Mr.
Darwin himself supplied. It is not too much to say that
each of his botanical investigations, taken on its own
merits, would alone have made the reputation of any
ordinary botanist.
Mr. Darwin's attitude towards botany, as indeed to
biological studies generally, it should always be remem-
bered was in his early life essentially that of a naturalist
of the school of Linnaeus and Humboldta point of view
unfortunately now perhaps a little out of fashion. Nature
in all its aspects spoke to his feelings with a voice that
was living and direct. The writer of these lines can well
remember the impression which it made upon him to hear
Mr. Darwin gently complain that some of this warm
enthusiasm for nature, as it presents itself unanalysed to
ordinary healthy vision, seemed to be a little dulled in the
younger naturalists of the day, who were apt to be some-
what cramped by the limits of their work-rooms. The pages
of the "Journal of Researches" show no such restraint,
but abound with passages in which Mr. Darwin's ever
unstudied and simple language is carried by the force of
warm impression and a perfect joy in nature to a level of
singular beauty. One passage may be quoted as an
illustration: it is from the description of Bahia in

the far more numerous cases where there is no discover-
able similarity of physical conditions, and of their not
occurring in places where the conditions are similar.
Now under the theory of modification of species after
migration and isolation, their representation in distant
localities is only a question of time, and changed physical
conditions. In fact, as Mr. Darwin well sums up, all the
leading facts of distribution are clearly explicable under
this theory; such as the multiplication of new forms, the
importance of barriers in forming and separating zoo-
logical and botanical provinces; the concentration of
related species in the same area; the linking together
under different latitudes of the inhabitants of the plains
and mountains, of I he forests, marshes, and deserts, and
the linking of these with the extinct beings which formerly
inhabited the same areas; and the fact of different forms
of life occurring in areas having nearly the same physical
conditions."
If Mr. Darwin had done no more than this in the
botanical field he would have left an indelible mark on the
progress of botanical science. But the consideration of
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
the various questions which the problem of the Origin of
Species presented led him into other inquiries in which
the results were scarcely less important. The key-note
of a whole series of his writings is struck by the words
with which the eighth chapter of the Origin of Species
commences :
"The view generally entertained by naturalists is that
species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed
with the quality of sterility, in order to prevent the con-
fusion of all organic forms."
The examination of this principle necessarily obliged
him to make a profound study of the conditions and
limits of sterility. The results embodied in his well-
known papers on dimorphic and trimorphic plants afforded
an absolutely conclusive proof that sterility was not in-
separably tied up with specific divergence. But the
question is handled in the most judicial way, and when
the reader of the chapter on hybridism arrives at the con-
cluding words in which Mr. Darwin declares that on this
ground "there is no fundamental distinction between
species and varieties," he finds himself in much the same
intellectual position as is produced by the Q.E.D. at the
end of a geometrical demonstration.
It was characteristic of Mr. Darwin's method to follow
up on its own account, as completely as possible, when

opportunity presented, any side issue which had been
raised apparently incidentally in other discussions. In-
deed it was never possible to guess what amount of evi-
dence Mr. Darwin had in reserve behind the few words
which marked a mere step in an argument. It was this
practice of bringing out from time to time the contents of
his unseen treasure-house which affords some insight into
the scientific energy of his later years, at first sight so in-
explicably prolific. Many of his works published during
that period may be properly regarded in the light of ex-
cursuses on particular points of his great theory. The
researches on the sexual phenomena of heterostyled
plants, alluded to above, which were communicated to
the Linnean Society in a series of papers ranging over
the years 1862-8, ultimately found their complete deve-
lopment in the volume "On the Different Forms of
Flowers or Plants of the same Species," published in
1877. In the same way, the statement in the Origin of
Species, that "the crossing of forms only slightly dif-
ferentiated, favours the vigour and fertility of their off-
spring," finds its complete expansion in " The Effects of

rather be said that plants acquire and display this power
only when it is of some advantage to them; this being of
comparatively rare occurrence, as they are affixed to the
ground, and food is brought to them by the air and rain."
The diversity of the power of movement in plants natu-
rally engaged his attention, and the last but one of his
worksin some respects perhaps the most remarkable of
themwas devoted to showing that these could be re-
garded as derived from a single fundamental property.
"All the parts or organs of every plant while they con-
tinue to grow . . . are continually circumnutating."
Whether this masterly conception of the unity of what
has hitherto seemed a chaos of unrelated phenomena will
be sustained time alone will show. But no one can doubt
the importance of what Mr. Darwin has done in showing
that for the future the phenomena of plant movement can
and indeed must be studied from a single point of view.
Along another line of work Mr. Darwin occupied him-
self with showing what aid could be given by the principle
of natural selection in explaining the extraordinary variety
of detail in plant morphology. The fact that cross-fer-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
tilisation was an advantage, was the key with which, as
indicated in the pages of the "Origin of Species," the
bizarre complexities of orchid flowers could be unlocked.
The detailed facts were set out in a well-known work, and
the principle is now generally accepted with regard to
flowers generally. The work on insectivorous plants gave
the results of an exploration similar in its object and
bringing under one common physiological point of view a
variety of the most diverse and most remarkable modifica-
tions of leaf-form.
In the beginning of this article the attempt has already
been made to do justice to the mark Mr. Darwin has
left on the modern study of geographical botany (and that
implies a corresponding influence on physio-palxonto-
logy). To measure the influence which he has had on
any other branches of botany, it is sufficient to quote
again from the "Origin of Species" :" The structure
of each part of each species, for whatever purpose used,
will be the sum of the many inherited changes, through
which that species has passed during its successive adap-
tations to changed habits and conditions of life." These
words may almost be said to be the key-note of Sachs's
well-known text-book, which is regarded as the most autho-
ritative modern exposition of the facts and principles of
plant-structure and function. And there is probably not

a botanical class-room or work-room in the civilised
world, where they are not the animating principle of both
instruction and research.
Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical
work, Mr. Darwin always disclaimed any right to be
regarded as a botanist. He turned his attention to plants
doubtless because they were convenient objects for study-
ing organic phenomena in their least complicated forms;
and this point of view, which if one may use the expres-
sion without disrespect, had something of the amateur
about it, was in itself of the greatest importance. For,
from not being, till he took up any point, familiar with
the literature bearing on it, his mind was absolutely free
from any prepossession. He was never afraid of his facts
or of framing any hypothesis, however startling, which
seemed to explain them. However much weight he
attributed to inheritance as a factor inorganic pheno-
mena, tradition went for nothing in studying them. In
any one else such an attitude would have produced much
work that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwinif one

appreciation of their excellence, we weary of their very
virtues. One turns from their copious Griindlichkeit, as
from the indispensable labour of life, and one finds in the
reading of a good__French text-book a never-failing
pleasure.
Only the first volume of the Lecons is as yet before us,
and some of our criticisms may have, on that account,
to be taken with allowance; for the head, however im-
portant, is not the whole body. We see at once that
there is little in common between them and the " Electri-
city Statique ;" the plan of the work, so far as it has gone,
is quite different. It originated, so the preface tells us, in
the lectures of one of the authors at the College de
France. The first volume is general and theoretical; the
second is to be special and practical. As to the propriety
of such an arrangement, much depends on the class of
students to which it is addressed. If it is meant for such
as have already a considerable knowledge of electrical
phenomena, and some practice in accurately conceiving
and describing them, then the plan is good. If, on the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
other hand, the reader is supposed to be a beginner in
electrical science, knowing nothing of the phenomena,
but furnished merely with the requisite mathematical
knowledge, then we do not think well of it. We prefer in
that case, the arrangement of the "Electricite" Statique,"
that is, a fuller account of the phenomena upon which
the fundamental principles rest, with a mathematical
treatment sufficient to prevent vagueness of impression,
and thereafter a detailed deductive account of the con-
sequences of the fundamental principles, and a full de-
scription of the phenomena irrespective of their agreement
or disagreement with theory. Assuming that we have to
deal with a student, who has the first element of a physi-
cist, viz. a tolerable mathematical education, perhaps the
greatest danger to be avoided is formalism, or blind
swearing, in verba magistri. Nothing is more likely to
encourage this, than hurried and hasty discussion of
fundamental facts. Nothing in reality is gained by
driving the learner express to the law of the inverse
square, and then leisurely expounding its consequences.
Far better, that we should first secure for him a thorough
qualitative understanding of the natural phenomena; and
then teach him how they can be built together upon an
abstract frame-work, whose lines they will follow, not
necessarily with absolute coincidence. The learner must
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be taught at the very outset that analysis is the servant and
not the master of the physicist; and that a physical idea
is not always simplified by clothing it in an analytical
suit of buckram. This much as a warning to possible
students of this volume.
With one feature of the plan of these Lecons we must
express unqualified satisfaction; that is the adoption of
the methods of Thomson and Maxwell. At times these
are so closely followed that the paragraphs are little more
than translation; at other times considerable changes,
chiefly in the way of simplification, are introduced.
At the same time, the authors have not scrupled to borrow
from other sources, where good material was to be had.
They have gone on the principle of Moliere, "jeprends
mon bien ou je le trouve "; and rightly, for scientific light
(unlike political or theological), is not supposed to be the
property of one sect or one country. The English reader
will not find much that is new, or perhaps we should say
not accessible to him in his own language, however much
he may learn as to arrangement and demonstration.

63 may have been originally drawn by M. Bertrand;
but, as no reference is given, we cannot meantime
be sure whether his claim is any better than that of
Clausius.
Detailed analysis being clearly out of place here, we
conclude with a few running comments on the different
parts of the work. The first part deals with Electro-
statical Phenomena. Except that we think the introduc-
tory chapter somewhat hurried and meagre, we commend
the general simplicity of the arrangement. A quasi-
physical proof of most of the general propositions con-
cerning electrified systems is given, and, we think, in the
interest of the physical reader, that this is right. The
seventh chapter of this part is especially recommended to
the notice of our readers; there, so far as we know for
the first time, Sir W. Thomson's theory of dielectrics
finds its place in a text-book on Electrostatics; both here
and in the corresponding chapters on Magnetism the
authors show a complete appreciation and mastery of this
important step in mathematical physics. Until Maxwell's
treatise was written, this piece of Thomson's work had
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
been apparently forgotten. It has lately been taken up
in Germany, more especially by Helmholtz more suo.
This neglect is no doubt to be explained by the equal
neglect of the ideas of Faraday, of which Thomson's
theory is the mathematical embodiment. The errors one
occasionally finds on this subject in continental text-
books of authority are very surprising, e.g. it will be
found stated that a small sphere of magnetic or dia-
magnetic substance tends to move along the lines of
force; the better diffusion of the true theory will surely
tend to prevent such fundamental mistakes as this.
The application of Thomson's theory to dielectrics is
most interesting and important theoretically; but great
difficulty has been found in verifying it experimentally,
owing to the scarcity of bodies that will insulate suffi-
ciently well. Its application to magnetics has been most
successful, as our readers doubtless know.
The second part treats of electric currents, stationary
and variable, and will probabiy be found well suited for
the higher class of practical electricians; the account of
the theory of telegraphic signalling deserves special
mention. In Chapter II. of this part the authors are more cautious as to Volta's law of contact than they are
at the end of the former part, knowing doubtless, as
sound practicians, that they are on delicate ground.
The theory of magnetism, which constitutes the third

part, suffers, as did the electrostatics, in the .beginning,
from the suppression of experimental detail. We cannot
reconcile ourselves to the definition given of the magnetic
axis as the line joining the poles of the magnet. This
seems a very artificial and difficult way of introducing this
fundamental conception; and we do not see the advan-
tage over the ordinary method, which defines it as that
direction which is always found parallel to a certain fixed
vertical plane when the magnet is suspended freely under
the earth's action alone at a given time and place. We
also fail to see why, in mentioning the hypotheses ad-
vanced to explain terrestrial magnetism, Gilbert and Biot
should be mentioned, and Hal ley and Hansteen forgotten.
In other respects, this part of the work gives as good an
account of its subject as most treatises we have seen.
Our readers may note the discussion of the direct mag-
netic action of the heavenly bodies as something fresh in
a text-book.
The last part of the work deals with Electro-magnetism.

You have given some figures about the winter of 1881-82 in

The general character of the e months is thus a very decided
high temperature. That of January was the warmest on record
in the 130 years' observation. If we take the mean of the three months, January, February, and March, it is also the highest on
record, viz., 287; the other years in which these three months
had the highest temperature were: 1822, 28.1; 1863, 27^4;
1843, 26"9; 1794, 266. The temperature of the five months,
November to March, viz, 28"2 in 1881-82, was surpassed only
once, in 1821-22, 293; the other years when these months were
warmest are: 1842-43, 27*6; 1761-69, 27-l; and 182627,
26-9.
The Neva was frozen less than four months, while on the
average the ice lasts nearly five months (147 days), and in the
winter of 1880-81 the river was frozen 184 days, the longest
time on record since the observations began, that is, for about
175 years. The date of opening of the river this year, March 30,
is the earliest, except that of 1822 (March 18).
The last winter is, besides, noticeable for its deficiency of
snow, there being scarcely ten days of fair sleighing. The pre-

cipitation of the months from November to March was l"'9 less
than the average, that of December alone by o"-8, that is, by
nearly two-thirds. Besides, a large part of it fell as rain. On
account of the want of snow, the rivers had not their ordinary
spring floods, and great quantities of timber, prepared to be
floated for the use of St. Petersburg, could not be moved.
On the middle and lower Wolga, the snowfall of last winter
was excessive, and even Taschkent and the valley of Ferghana,
in Central Asia (lat. 4o"-42°), had an exceedingly cold winter,
with permanent and deep snow. The winter was also very cold
in Transcaucasia, the minimum temperature in November, 1881,

Fleet was inundated from a breach in the beach, and the church
washed down, and many houses in Chesilton destroyed.
It is said locally, that the material is so finely graduated, that
a native boatman or fisherman can tell in the darkest night the
exact locality his boat may come ashore or be beached on, by
picking up a handful of the gravel. In a south-west gale it is
next to impossible to stand on the eastern crest, from the rain of
pebbles projected over its summit by the breaking waves.
The Chesil is shown with great accuracy in early manuscript
maps, especially in a remarkable series of drawings collected
by the great Cecil, well known at the British Museum as "Lord
Burleigh's Book;" also in drawings by Collins and Lilly. From
these it would appear, that two or three centuries back the
"Fleet " was wider, leading to the inference that the beach had
retreated landward; but a close inspection of the bank does not
support this conclusion, but appears to show that the surplus
material is driven in heavy weather right over the crest sloping
towards the "Fleet," the area of which has been narrowed and

reduced by this continued process.
The gradation of material here again shows the ultimate lee-
ward movement from west to east, due to preponderance of
winds from the first quarter; the altitude from three to four
times that of the normal elevation of ordinary English beaches
above high water; also the upper plateau above the usual neap
and spring " fulls" are striking features, showing its abnormal
character.
The largest shingle travelling to leeward and to the sum-
mit, is illustrative of the accumulative energy of the heavier
projectiles, and their being less acted on by the recoil than
the smaller materials.
It may be well to notice here the soundings taken in H.M.S.
Beagle, between Santa Cruz and the Falkland Islands, referred
to by the late Mr. Darwin in his work "Geological Observa-

senting the usual phenomena in such cases. The material

Meteor
On Wednesday, June 7, 9 45 p.m. G.M.T., at a station 396
yards north-west by west of the transit-circle of the ob-ervatory,
Mr. W. H. Robinson's attention was attracted by the sudden
appearance of a fine meteor about 3° below Mars, which parsed
through a point 50 below Regulus, and, continuing its course
about 12" further, finally disappeared. Almost instantly after
being first seen, it shone very brightly, then assumed a train of
detached luminous beads, and towards the end of its path burst,
presenting an appearance similar to the bursting of a rocket. Its
greatest brilliancy was equal to Venus. The length of the whole
track was about 25°, and the time of visibility of the train was

ments by means of bulkheads. A longitudinal bulkhead
is fitted at the middle line; the boilers are contained in
four separate water-tight compartments; the engines in
two; and the coal bunkers are also water-tight.
The engines and boilers are manufactured by Messrs.
Humphreys and Co. There are two pairs of engines
working twin screws. They are of the horizontal com-
pound type, the cylinders of each pair being 38 inches
and 64 inches in diameter, and the stroke 39 inches.
They are intended to indicate an aggregate horse power
of 5500. These engines are remarkable for their lightness
and the comparatively small space they occupy. Most of
their novel features have been adopted for the purpose of
economising weight and space. They are almost entirely
of wrought iron, Whitworth steel, and gun-metal; very
little cast iron being used in their construction. The
screws are three-bladed, and are 14 feet in diameter, with
15 feet to 17 feet pitch. The shafts are left bare where
they come outside the hull of the ship, and are not sur-
rounded by tubes, as is usual in ships of the Navy.
These tubes have been dispensed with for the purpose of

diminishing the resistance. The boilers are of the loco-
motive type; and these also were adopted in preference to
the ordinary marine boiler, for the purpose of saving
weight and space. They are 5 feet 3 inches in diameter,
and 14 feet 4 inches in length, and work with a steam
pressure of 120 tons per square inch. The shells are of
steel, the fire-boxes of iron, and tubes of brass; and they
are similar to ordinary locomotive boilers, except that the
tubes are shorter and the fire wells less deep. The stoke-
holds are closed in, and forced draught is worked with, as
in the fast torpedo boats. This is supplied by four fans,
two of which are 4 feet and the other two 3 feet 6 inches
in diameter. The fan engines have 9-inch cylinders, and
\\ inches stroke, and run at the rate of 900 to 1000 revo-
lutions per minute when working at full speed.
The trials of the machinery have, so far, not been suc-
cessful, chiefly on account of difficulties with the boilers.
During the first series of trials, on March 2, 4, and 6 last,
nothing could be done on account of priming. The
greatest speed realised was 10 to 12 knots, when the
boilers primed so badly that a stop had to be come to.
On March 31 there was another trial, the last down to
the present time, when the difficulties of priming were
mainly got over. The indicated horse-power on that
occasion was about 5000, and the speed a little over 17

knots. The air-pressure in the stoke-holds, which gave
the forced draught, was equivalent to 5 inches of water.
On this occasion the boiler-tubes leaked very badly, so
that the full power could not be realised. The priming
was due to oil from the engines getting into the boilers,
and this now appears to be remedied. In the torpedo
boats that are fitted with locomotive boilers, the same
difficulty arises, and oil is not used at all in the cylinders,
or only very sparingly. The leaking of the tubes is a
more serious difficulty to get over, although in the Poly-
phemus the arrangements appear to admit of improve-
ment. For instance, solid iron stays were fitted in the
midst of the brass tubes; and it must be obvious that the
unequal rate of expansion of the stays and tubes when
heated to a high temperature must have considerably
strained the tube plates. These stays are now being
removed, and new tubes are being fitted throughout, the
ends of which are to be screwed into the tube plates.
This difficulty of leaky tubes is not peculiar to the
Polyphemus. Messrs. Thornycroft are in the same posi-
tion with a large number of torpedo boats they have

DOUBLE STARS
COME stars when looked at in a telescope are seen
*-' really to consist of two stars so near together that
the naked eye is not able to distinguish them, but sees
them as a single star.1 The knowledge of some of these
objects may be presumed to be almost as old as the
telescope. In fact Hevel remarked some of them in the
middle of the seventeenth century, but no attention was
paid to them, as it was thought that they were really far
asunder in space, and merely appeared close together in
the heavens, because they were nearly in the same visual
ray. It thus escaped notice that one star frequently
moves round the other, and Lambert, as late as 1761,
founded his opinion that those fixed stars that appear
near others, were in no physical connection with them,
upon this absence of relative motion, because, as he says
in his " Cosmologische Briefe," if they do not move round

each other, and still gravitate towards each other, they
must long ago have collapsed. But a few years after the
Rev. John Michell applied the rules of the calculation of
probabilities to the stars in the Pleiades, and showed that
it was exceedingly improbable that these stars could
appear so near together, if their proximity was the result
of a random scattering of the stars over the heavens, and
he showed that among 40,000 stars, one could expect to
find only one pair within twelve seconds of arc of each
other, and none nearer. These speculations were, how-
ever wholly conjectural, as long as no proper observations
were available, and it was therefore to the purpose when
the highly merited Jesuit, Christian Mayer, of the obser-
vatory at Mannheim, founded by the Elector of Pfalz,
commenced to search for, and systematically to observe,
double stars. But he met with no support from his con-
temporaries, and had to defend his opinions in several
polemical pamphlets. His instrument, a mural quadrant
by Bird, was scarcely sufficient for the purpose, and his
opinion, that, "satellites" of the brighter fixed stars were
found at a distance of as much as three degrees, was cer-
tainly wrong in the instances he adduced, though Madler
has shown that stars as far asunder may possibly be phy-
sically connected.2 We must, therefore, consider William
Herschel to be the first who proved the existence of

double stars. This he did by aid of micrometric me 1-
sures,3 which he originally had made with the view of
finding the parallax of fixed stars, similar observations
having previously been attempted by the Rev. Roger Long,
of Pembroke College, Cambridge, who, however, had not
been very successful.
Herschel commenced micrometric measures in 1776,
when he observed 8 Orionis. In 1779 he began syste-
matically to search for and measure double stars, and as
early as 1782 he laid his first "Catalogue of Double
Stars" before the Royal Society. It contained 269 ob-
jects, but few of which had been observed by Chr. Mayer.
Subsequently he published other catalogues, which, how-
ever, contain many stars more than 32" asunder, which
are not now considered as double stars proper; but of the
latter Herschel discovered between four and five hundred.
He measured double stars micrometrically up to 1785, and
again for some years after 1790. The measures showed
some discrepancies, but it was impossible "> decide
whether the relative motion of the componentsfor
changed their position some of them evidently hadwas

merit he worked indefatigably for thirteen years, making
above 10,000 measures ; and it may be said that by this
telescope the genius of its maker carried the palm on be-
half of refractors in measuring minute quantities in the
sky, while the reflectors stepped into the background, and
were subseqnently preferred only in cases where the
definition is of less consequence than light-grasping
power.1 Struve not only made measuresthanks to
Fraunhofer's excellent micrometer and his skill in
handling itmore accurate than had been possible up to
that time, but he also catalogued about 3000 double stars
between the pole and fifteen degrees southern declination.
He had their places exactly determined with Ertel's
meridian-circle, and these observations, compared with
those of later date, have in many cases established the
fact that the proper motion was common for two stars,
that revolved so slowly that no change in their relative
position had been discovered by aid of the micrometer.
Thus their physical connection is then established, but
indeed "optical double stars" are so uncommon within
the limits here considered, that the discovery of an

optical couple is almost a greater curiosity. In such a
case the micrometric measures serve to accurately fix the
amount of the proper motion of one star, the other being
generally so distant that it appears stationary, as well as
to ascertain the parallax of the nearer star if perceptible.
Struve also every night carefully noted the magnitude and
colour of the stars he observed, and divided them into
Lucida and reliqucr, according to whether the smallest
star is above or below the eighth magnitude. According
to their mutual distance, he divided them into eight
classes, as follows:

multiplicium mensurae micrometrica? per magnum Fraun-

institutis."
Though Struve achieved his main results after the
arrival of Fraunhofer's refractor, he had made double-
star observations as early as 1814, but his apparatus were
then so deficient, that he had to try to make use of dif-
ferences of right ascension observed with a small transit
instrument, an attempt that, in spite of his experience as
an observer, could not but prove a failure. His observa-
tions were subsequently continued, under his direction,
by his son, who, with the 14^-inch refractor at Pulkowa,
discovered about 500 additional objects. He has made
about 7000 measures during the last forty years, and thus
we are in possession of observations continued during
about seventy years by the Struves, after the same
methods.
Meantime, similar investigations had made consider-
able progress elsewhere. In England, the subject was
taken up by the Rev. W. R. Dawes, who, taking into con-
sideration the smallness of his means, achieved more
than any contemporary observer. He is justly considered
one of the most distinguished of those amateur astrono-

more than 1000 observations up to this. Latterly, this
branch of science has made distinct advances in Ame-
rica, where Burnham has made excellent use of the
gigantic refractors, which are made by Alvan Clark of
Boston. He has discovered a number of important
double Stars, the components of which cannot be sepa-
rated at all in older telescopes!
In 1878 the French astronomer Flammarion, who is so
favourably known from his excellent popular treatises,
published his " Catalogue des Etoiles doubles et multiples
en Mouvement relatif certain, comprenant toutes les
Observations faites sur chaque couple depuis sa décou-
verte, et les résultats conclus the ll§.tude des mouvements," a work that is highly valued by double-star investi-
gators, but private observers will do well in consulting
also Messrs. Crossley, Gledhill, and Wilsons Hand-
book of double-Stars," with its  Supplement."
As remarked above Herschel found that changes had
taken place in several systems of double-stars, and in
1836 Struve was able to give a list of a hundred systems,
where the components appeared to revolve; but on
account of the difficulty of the measures, it was not easy
to decide whether this was owing to actual motion of the
star or in some cases to divergences of the observations.

But he proved beyond dispute in about half the cases
that the companion had revolved, and Madler, who was
one of the most indefatigable double-star observers, as
well as the most prominent calculator, raised this number
to several hundreds. His work,  Tabula geueralis
stellarum duplicium indicationem motus gyratorii ex-
hibentium," was published in 1849, and contains 650
entries, but many of these were mere surmises, and have
not been corroborated by subsequent research.
If the observations were absolutely free from errors, it
would be an easyltask to investigate the path of the companion, but in addition to the imperfection of every
observed position, we have as explained above to guard
against systematic differences between the different ob-
servers. In long series of observations of quickly
revolving stars, this gives occasion to endless discussion.
We draw, for instance, a powerful aid in discerning sys-
tematic errors, from Keplcr`s law, that the areas described
by the radius vector are proportional to the intervals of
time; but he would be a bold man, who in the present
state of our knowledge, would affirm that all binary stars
have been proved to revolve according to this law in
elliptic orbits, in the focus of which the main star is
situated, or would condemn all observations that could
not be made to fit into such an hypothesis. But though
this assumption is a mere hypothesis, and may remain so

for a longtime to come, we have nothing else to guide
us. In tact we cannot calculate an orbit at all except by
aid of these laws. W. Doberck (To be 1:an1inu¢°ri.)
' The difficulty of se :rating close double stars renders then- fit tests for
the performance of a telescope. Some ilea cf the nuality ofa telescope may
be gained, when it is stlteryihat it is able to separate objects of a certain
class, be it lurid.: or reliquz, but withal, it is preferable to try its perform-
ance on terrestrial test objects. A third sub class "delicate " double stars, or those in which the companion is so minute compared to the main star, as
to require a high de ree of optical power to perceive it, has been added by
Sirgohn l*{erschel,1ut it deserves to be remarked that the appearance of
sue objects depends quite as much upon the state of the atmosphere. The
companion of irius, for instance, has been repeatedly seen in 4-inch re-
fr-actors under exceptionally favoumble circumstances, though in a great
latitude. A large acerture is therefore not always an advantage. The situation
of the observatory is of much greaterimportance, Piazzi Smyth has the merit
of having for years insisted upon this point. The Lick Observatory, about
to be founded on Mount Hamilton. California, will offer unusual advantages.

M for which the line has been cons'nicted.
The linen-bleaching establishment of M.Paul Duchesne-
Fournet is situated at Le Breuil-en-Auge, and is a large
concern to which most of the linen fabrics manufactured
at Lisieux are sent to be bleached. The complete pro-
cess of bleaching consists in successively exposing the
linen pieces first to the action of chlorine, then to alka-
line baths, lastly to the sun's rays. The last operation is
of course conducted out of doors by laying out the linen
in the open meadows. Each length of linen measures
about 100 metres, and the establishment boasts a bleach-
ing ground of 15 hectares (37 acres). The operation of
taking up the pieces is laborious, necessitating several
workmen.

mechanism. But a railway worked by a steam-engine
could not be tolerated in the bleaching field, as the smoke
produced by the burning fuel and the ashes projected
from the funnel would play havoc with the linen laid out
beside the line. M. Dupuy therefore determined to build
an electric railway, the construction of which is now
finished, and which works very satisfactorily.
The electric railway of Le Breuil-en-Auge passes the
end of each of the many plots upon which the linen is
laid out, there being a piece of straight line 500 metres in
length, and twenty-one branch lines. The total length is
2040 metres. The rails are of the narrow gauge of o-S

tram starts from the factory with the wagons empty.
Arrived at the bleach-field, it stops. By the movement of

windlass rollers employed to wind up the linen. Passing
between these rollers the linen ascends to another roller
in the top of the car, which covers the machinery, where
it passes to a workmen, who packs it in folds in a little

Reynier, who in 1881 applied a similar device to a sewing
machine driven by electricity at the Paris Exposition, is
thereby stretched. As its tension increases, there is
better contact electrically between its links, and with this
better contact the electric resistance diminishes; the
flow of current and consequently the speed of the engine,
is therefore increased. By moving the lever in one
direction or the other, the speed of the train may therefore
be varied at wilL When the lever is put back to its posi-
tion of rest, it not only breaks contact, but also puts on
the brake. To reverse the motion of the train, there is a

In the top of the tender is a switch, by means of which
the accumulators can be used in rotation, beginning with
a minimum of twenty-four, and increasing successively
by sixes up to sixty cells.
This railway has worked since March last with results
advantageous in every way. The speed of the train
attains 12 kilometres (about 7 J miles) per hour; but in
this special case, great speed is not desired. According
to the information furnished by M. Dupuy, the train can

work for three hours; being limited only by the charge
that can be imparted to the accumulators.
This application of electricity to a purpose for which a
steam-engine would be out of the question, is not only
novel, but suggestive. We feel disposed to query how
long it will be before that great section of the public ot London who travel by the Metropolitan Railway, insist
that their lungs and eyes have as much claim as the linen
of M. Duchesne-Fournet to be protected from the dis-
astrous presence of the smuts and scoriae of the steam-
engine.
THE WEATHER OF THE PAST WEEK
THE very disagreeable weather we have had these last
few days deserves a passing notice. Strong per-
sistent northerly winds for nearly a week have swept over
the whole of the British islands. On Sunday and Mon-
day a continuous north-easterly gale blew over Shetland
and Orkney, completely interrupting all communication
among these islands, accompanied with heavy rains,
floods, and hailstorms; and at the same time much snow
fell in the upland districts of the interior of North Britain,

We have received from Bucharest a little brochure of the
greatest interest, in the shape of a translation into Roumanian of
Sir John Lubbock's British Association address, "Fifty Years

learn from the title page, is made from the report in Nature.
Prefixed is a brief address to Sir John Lubbock, which is writ'.en

the heart of the people who populate the plains and mountains
of the Lower Danube. The scientific truths and literary beauties
of such a work of genius cannot remain unknown to the Rou-

making it more known among them. I beg of you, therefore,
to glance at it, and to receive it as your own; you will recognise
it, perhaps, by its forms, which are impossible to be changed."

A committee of members of the Academy of Sciences, the

We regret to announce the death of Mr. Scott Russell, the emi-
nent engineer, which took place on Thursday morning last, in the
seventy-fifth year of his age. John Scott Russell, according to
Engineering, was the eldest son of the Rev. David Russell, a Scotch
clergyman. His great predilection for mechanics and other
natural sciences induced his father to allow him to enter a work,
shop, to learn the handicraft of the profession of an engineer.
He subsequently studied at the Universities of Edinburgh, St.
Andrews, and Glasgow, and graduated at the last at the early
age of sixteen. He had attained to such proficiency in the
knowledge of the natural sciences, that on the death of Sir John
Leslie, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Edinburgh, in 1832,
the young Scott Russell, though then only twenty-four years of
age, was elected to fill the vacancy temporarily, pending the
election of a permanent profe-sor. About this time he com-
menced his famous researches into the niture of waves, with the
vie* to improving the forms of vessels. His first paper on this
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
subject was read before the British Association in 1835. The
interest created by this paper was so ^reat that a committee was
appointed by the Association t j carry on the experiments at their
expense. Mr. Scott Ku.sell discovered during these researches
the existence of the wave of translation, and developed the
wave-line system of construction of ships in connection with
which his name is so widely known. In 1837 he read a paper
be;ore the Royal Society of Edinburgh, "On the Laws by
which water opposes resistance to the motion of floating bodies."
For this paper he received the large gold medal of the Society.
In 1844 Mr. Scott Russell removed to London. In 1847 he
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He for a short
time occupied the post of the secretary of the Society of Arts,
which place he resigned to become joint secretary with Sir
Stafford Northcote of the Great Exhibition of 1851. He was,
in fact, one of the three original promoters of the Exhibition,
and under the direction of the late Prince Consort, took a
leading part in organising it. Mr. Scott Russell was for many
years known as a shipbuilder on the Thames. The most im-
portant work he ever constructed was the Great Eastern steam-

micaceous clay found in this upland region, between the
Alleghany and Blue Mountains, during the years 1879-82.

The material of the stone objects is almost exclusively steatite,
or soap-stone, which abounds in the district, and which might
almost seem to have been sculptured with metal instruments, so
perfect is the workmanship. The objects themselves are abso-
lutely of a unique type, consisting partly of human and animal
figures, either in the round or in various degrees of relief, partly
of household utensils, such as cups, mugs, basins, dishes, and
the like, partly of purely fancy, and other miscellaneous articles,
illustrating the tastes, usages, and culture of the unknown people
by whom they have been executed. Collectively they present,
Mr. Keane maintains, a unique school of art developed at some
remote period in a region where the presence of civilised men
had not hitherto been even suspected. The human type, which
presents great uniformity, while still by no means conventional,
is distinctly non-Indian, according to Mr. Keane, but whether
Mongolic or Caucasic it would at present be fpremature to
decide. All are represented as fully clothed, not in the hairy
blanket of the Red Man, but in a close-fitting well-made
dress somewhat after the modern "united garment" fashion.
Some are seated in armchairs exactly resembling those known
as "Ingestre Chairs," while others are mounted on the ani-

are stated to be marvellously executed. Some of them repre-
sent the bear, the prairie dog, and other quadruped-, as well as
birds of North America. But others seem to represent types of

the Old World, such as the two-humped Baktrian camel, the
rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and European dog; There are also
some specimens obviously executed since the appearance of the
white man, as shown by the horse with his rider, firearms, shoes,
&c. The material of all these has a much fresher look than the
others, and is of much ruder workmanship, as if they were the
work of the present race of Indians. These races are undoubt-
edly of the pure Indian type, Mr. Keane stated, and recognised
themselves as intruders in this region, where they had certainly
been preceded by more civilised peoples, such as the Mound-
builders and others, of whom they had traditions, and whom
they had extirpated long before the arrival of the Europeans.
Am'.ngst these extinct peoples were the' Allegs or Alleghewis,
whoje name survives in the "Alleghany Mountains." These
Alleghewis are said to have been a different race from the
Indian, and it is possible, Mr. Keane thought, that in their new
homes in the Alleghany uplands they may have continued or
developed the culture of which we have met remarkable evi-
dence in these stone objects. It is evident, however, that before
any conclusions can be built on this interesting find, the con-
ditions under which it was found must be carefully sifted by

NATURE
September 12 last year, has been described by Mr. Engler to
the St. Louis Academy. While an aurora of normal type was
clearly seen in the northern sky, there appeared in the south-
east, about 30 to 35 deg. above the horizon two horizontal streaks
of light, about 5 deg. apart, and 15 or 20 deg. in length. Their
pale hazy light resembled moonlight. From the upper streak
were suspended, by small cords of light, a number of balls,
brighter than either of the streaks, which were continually jump-
ing up and down in vertical lines, much like pith-balls u .. n
charged with electricity. Above the upper streak was a 'right
gauze space with convergent sides, seemingly comp's J of
streamers of light, the brightness diminishing from the streak
outwards. From the lower streak extended a similar mass,
differing only in a greater inclination of the streamers. The
balls and cords gradually disappeared first, then the streamers,
then the streaks; and the « hole phenomenon lasted about half
an hour. No explanation is offered. It is noteworthy that on
the same evening and at the same hour, a most remarkable band
of white light was seen at Albany, N.Y., Utica, N. Y., Hanover,
N.H., Boston, Mass., and elsewhere in the North Atlantic
Sntes, spanning the heavens from east to west near the zenith.

1 A Suspected Variable Star.Mr. S. M. B. Gemmill
writes from Glasgow, expressing the opinion that <p Draconis
will prove to be a variable star. For some time past he has
observed it to be almost equal to x m the same constellation,
whereas Groombridge and others had given a difference of one
magnitude. The "Durchmusterung " has 4-7 and 3'8 for these
stars respectively, and the first Radcliffe catalogue, for which the
magnitudes were very carefully estimated, has 4*4 and 37. Heis
assigns a difference of half a magnitude. Mr. Gemmill states
he has found a very slight fluctuation in \fil Draconis, which
seems to be periodic. Baily, in his notes to the British Cata-
logue, says: "This star is marked as of the 7th magnitude in
the British Catalogue; but in the original entries it is designated
once as 4J, once as 3$, and once as the 5th."

a successful conclusion, the results agreeing generally with those
recently deduced by M. Wolf, of the Observatory at Paris, who
employed a very different instrument and method. A complete
survey of the relative brightness or magnitudes of all the stars in
the northern hemisphere reputed to be visible to the naked eye
has been commenced, and it is hoped that before the date of the
next report, all the stars brighter than the fifth magnitude, some
five hundred in number, will have been measured. The report
touches also upon the discordances between the observed degree
of brightness of Comet 1882 a, with the results deduced from
theory. The expenditure for the purposes of the Observatory,
has, it is stated been under the amount provided by Convocation;
a sum of 600/. per annum is available for three years from
December last, and this the Savilian Professor considers will
probably suffice for the future efficient maintenance of the Ob-
servatory, the only difficulty that might arise relating to neces-
sary repairs, &c-, of the present instruments, or the addition of
new ones that may be needed.

of the Transcaspian railway; it proved, that contrary to what
was presumed, the country does not have a general slope from
east to west. At the Aidin wells there are several places situ-
ated below the present level of the Caspian, and all the tract
between this place and the present shore of the CaspianM.
Les«ar statescannot be regarded as the former bed of a river;
it was probably the bottom of a very large gulf of the Caspian,
which extended towards the east. It is most probablehe adds
that a levelling between the Tekke oasis and Khiva or Bokhara,
will also show in the sand-steppes many tracts situated below the
level of the Caspian, as has been found in the Sara-kamysh
depression; and it will prove that the Murghal and Tejent could
not flow into the Oxus, but flowed into the Caspian, much ex-
tended at that time towards the east. We notice in the same

NA TURE
A NEW THERMOGRAPH^
THE instrument under consideration is a thermograph for
recording the atmospheric temperature, the fluctuatiocs of
which are much less regular and more frequent than one who
has not made a study of it would suppose. It records the tem-
perature directly from the column of mercury in the tube of a
thermometer by dots or perforations upon a sheet of paper
previously ruled with degrees and hour-.
Its principal parts are, as shown in Fig. I of plate:
1. A thermometer in the form of an ordinary mercury ther-
mometer, but open at the top of the tube, and having a wire
entering the bulb and connected to one pole of a battery, the
other pole of which is connected to the mechanism of the
instrument.
2. An upright cylinder revolving by clockwork, covered with
a paper which is divided vertically into twenly-fuur parts by
lines representing the hours, and horizontally by lines represent-
ing the degrees.
3. A bar raised and lowered by mechanism driven by clock-
work, furnished below with a needle entering the tube of the
thermometer, and carrying a pencilor preferably a point-

driven forward by a small electro-magnet when the circuit is
closed by the needle entering the mercury, and then making a
mark at the proper place upon the paper and indicating the
temperature.
The bar carrying ihe needle rises about half an inch from the
point at which the needle leaves the mercury, and then descends
until the needle again touches the mercury, whether that in the
meantime shall have risen or fallen, when the point makes its
mark upon the paper and the bar again commences to rise.
This movement is accompli>hed by the mechanism shown in
the drawing, of which only the wheel E, gearing into the rack
upon the needle-bar, is shown in Fig. 1, but which is shown in
full and U|on an enlarged scale in Fig. 2, which,is a top view.
The two wheels A and B are moved by clockwork (not shown),
and are constantly revolving in opposite directions, as indicated
by the arrows. These wheels are not attached to the shaft u, on
which the wheel E is fixed, but are attached to sleeves which
move without affecting that wheel except when they are joined
to it by the clutches C or D. They are so geared lhat when the
wheel E is joined to them, its rim moves at the rate of half an
inch per minute. Upon the shaft wi'h the wheel F is also a
loose sleeve F, which is free when the clutch c is not in action,
but which moves with that wheel when that clutch is on.
The levers actuating the two clutches unite and move upon a
common pivot, from which point they extend as an arm, which
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
is capable of a lateral movement between two stops, bringing
one or the other of the clutches into acion.
Opposite to the wheel E, the needle-bar passes through a
guide, which is furnished on the back with a small wheel taking
the thrust of the gear and reducing friction. For a lower guide,
the needle-bar is furnished on each side with a rod parallel to
the needle, and of nearly the same length. These rods are at
such distance apart that they pass clear of the thermometer tube.
They are not shown in the drawing, as they would lie directly
in front of and behind the needle and tube.
The teeth of the clutches are partly V-shaped and partly
square, or nearly so, as shown in Fig. 3 ; that is, they have
slightly tapered sides but V-shaped points and bases, so that
they enter freely, as entirely V-shaped teeth would do, and w hen
in action they have no outward thrust. The V-shaped base
strengthens the tooth and admits the point of the opposite tooth.
A very small spring on each side of the sleeve F holds it out
of gear while the clutch c is off.
Beneath the clutch arm is a pressure spring, one end of which
presses against the end of the arm, and the other against a plate
moving upon the same pivot with ihe arm, which plate also is

its distance from its armature, is least, the greatest possible por-
tion of the work being thus put upon the clockwork, and the
least upon the battery.
This spring aids the electro-magnet, but does not in any-
wise reduce the effect of the reversing spring in holding the
clutch to its work; so long as the base of that spring is un-
moved, its action is unimpaired. The resistance of these
springs occurs only during the ascent of the needle-bar, which is,
therefore, counterpoised to excess, and the resistance and the
motion are thus rendered uniform. By reason of the form of
the clutch-teeth before described, there is no outward thrust upon
the clutches while in action, and hence the reversing spring
requires only to be strong enough to throw the arm over and
to shift the clutches. The stop of the clutch-arm next the
electro-magnet is an insulated plate, to which the battery-wire
leading from the magnet is connected, so that as soon as the arm
has left the stop the circuit is again broken, although the needle
may for a short time remain in contact with the mercury; the
recording-point is at once withdrawn, and thus makes upon the
paper a single perforation which must be a true record of the
position of the mercury in the tube, unaffected by friction or

other disturbing cause, since this action must always take place
at the moment of contact of the needle with the mercury, and
these dots or perforations are repeated at the end of each interval
of time required for the needle-bar to ascend and descend the
required distance, which will be about two minutes with the
wheel-motion designated.
The graduation of the scale upon the paper must correspond
with the movement of the mercury in the tube of the thermo-
meter as accurately as the graduation of the scale of an ordinary
thermometer corresponds with the movement of the mercury in
its tube.
If but one instrument of this sort is to be made this is very
easy, the rate of motion is a certained, a scale is made to fit it,
and the paper is ruled to that scale.
In all thermometers heretofore made the scale has been made
to fit the tube, but if more than one of these instruments is to
be made, it becomes necessary, or at lea-t very convenient, to
have one set of ruled papers that will fit all the instruments, and
it then becomes necessary to reverse the practice and to make
the tubes to fit the scale.
The rise and fall of mercury in a thermometer depends upon
the proportion between the diameter of the tube and the volume
of mercury in the tube and bulb, and while it is possible to con-
struct these parts in such proportion as to obtain proximately a
given motion, it is not possible thus to obtain it exactly.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
The tube and bulb are made in separate parts, as shown in Fig.
I, of such size that when the tube is thrust half way into the
bulb, the volume of mercury filling the tube half way at 32°
Fahrenheit is as nearly as may be properly proportioned to the
diameter of the tube. If now there be found too much motion,
the capacity of lhe bulb is diminished by thrusting the lube
further in, and vice versa, and the proper height of mercury at
32° for that purpose is marked upon the tube.
Mercury exposed to the air will slowly form a coating of oxide
upon its surface. To prevent thi--, a small quantity of glycerin
or of oil free from oxygen is placed in the thermometer tube
above the mercury. If, notwithstanding, the oxide shall accu-
mulate to an inconvenient extent, the observer in charge of the
instrument will remove the thermometer from its place, and will
put the bulb in warm water until the oxide is floated off. He
will then supply the loss with pure mercury, determining the
proper quantity by immersing the bulb in broken ice, when the
mercury column should stand at the mark for 32°.
The whole apparatus, except the thermometer itself, can be
inclosed, and so protected from the weather and dust, while the
thermometer is exposed to the air below.

deviations from it for the 29 duodecades of each year, being mostly
but fractions of one day. But it must be observed that, for calcu-

Wurtzite, and Greenokit; on transformation-symbols, by Dr.
N. Daubrawa; and on minerals from the Kuchelbad diabase,
by MM. Preis and Urba. The papers on palaeontology, geo-
logy, zoology, and botany, mostly deal with the fauna and flora,
fossil or existing, of Bohemia itself. Dr. Ant. Fric gives a list
of all fossil animals found in the coal and limestone of the
Permian formation in Bohemia; whilst only two species were
known from this formation in 1868, M. Fric's list includes no
less than 87 species, mostly labyrinthodonts and fishes. Dr. O.

The Zulu title to the lands in South Africa rests simply on force,
the land being his property only so long as the occupant can hold it
by himself, or with the assistance of the chief who protects him.
The tenure cannot be transmitted by inheritance wiihout being
constantly sapped by the influence of two institutions universal
among the Zulus, viz., polygamy and slavery. Christianity has
a special bearing on the subject of land tenure, because it is
mainly through its agency, indirect as well as direct, that we
may look for such changes in the customs of the races of South
Africa as may civilise and settle them, and put an end to the
ceaseless wanderings which have tended so powerfully to keep
them in a state of ever-recurring barbarism. The author's im-
pression was that the advancement and civilisation of the native
tribes of South Africa depend greatly upon the extent to which
individual tenure of property can be extended, whilst some
patriarchal authority such as seems inherent in the head of a
family or kraal is recognised, and invested with some sort of
magisterial and judicial functions, sufficient to meet the every-

tion of these values. The apparatus consisted of a U-shaped
tube, having at the lower part a long straight tube, united to it
by fusion, while above, either branch terminated in a tube
twice bent at a right angle, and closed at the lower end. By
means of a Hagen air-pump this tube-system was gradually
evacuated to a pressure of 1-12,000,000 mm. mercury, and the
long straight tube opened under mercury at the lower end. The
mercury rose in both branches of the U-tube to barometric
height. One of the lateral ends of the apparatus was now kept
constant at 0°; while the other was first cooled to - 420, and
then heated to various temperatures; each time the position of
the mercury in the two branches was observed with a catheto-
meter, and the difference of their heights gave the vapour-tension.
The values so obtained for the vapour-tension of mercury were
less for all temperatures than those given by Regnault. Thus,
e.g. Herr Hagen found the tension at 0° = 0-015 mm-> Regnault
002; at 20°, Hagen 0'02I, Regnault 0^037; at 100°, Hagen
o-6i, Regnault 075; at 200°, Hagen 16, Regnault 199 mm.

accuracy (owing to the difficulty of taking readings with the
cathetometer, through round glass), these experiments at least

THE effects upon Psychology of Mr. Darwin's writings
have been so immense, that we shall not over-
state them by saying that they are fully comparable
with those which we have previously considered as having
been exerted by the same writings on geology, botany,
and zoology. This fact at first sight can scarcely fail to
strike us as remarkable, in view of the consideration that
Mr. Darwin was not only not himself a psychologist, but
had little aptitude for, and perhaps less sympathy with,
the technique of psychological method. The whole con-
stitution of his mind was opposed to the subtlety of the
distinctions and the mysticism of the conceptions which
this technique so frequently involves; and therefore he
was accustomed to regard the problems of mind in the
same broad and general light that he regarded all the
other problems of nature. But if at first sight we are
inclined to feel surprised that, although possessing none
of the special mental equipments of a psychologist, he
should have produced so enormous an influence upon
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
psychology, our surprise must vanish when we consider
the matter a little more attentively. For the truth of this
matter is that psychology, in being the science furthest
removed from the reach of experimental means and in-
ductive method, is the science which has longest remained
in the trammels of a priori analysis and metaphysical
thought; therefore Darwin, by casting the eye of a
philosophical naturalist upon the facts, without reference
to the cobwebs which the specialists had woven around
them, was able to gather directly much new information
as to their meaning. And the rare sagacity with which
he observed and reflected upon the phenomena of mind
merely as phenomena or facts of nature, led to the re-
markable results which we shall presently have to con-
siderresults which have done more than any other to
unmuffle the young science of psychology from the
swaddling clothes of its mediaeval nursery.
The portions of Mr. Darwin's writings which refer to
mental science are very limited in extentcomprising, in
fact, only one chapter in the "Origin of Species," three
in the "Descent of Man," and a short paper on the
development of infantile intelligence. The importance
of the effect produced by them is therefore rendered all
the more remarkable; but in this connection it seems
desirable to state that the chapters to which we have
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
alluded represent, in an exceedingly condensed form, the
result of extensive thought and reading. A year or
two ago Mr. Darwin lent the present writer the original
drafts of these essays, together with all the notes and
memoranda which he had collected on psychological sub-
jects during the previous forty years, and so we can testify
that any one who reads these MSS. is more likely to be
surprised at the amount of labour which they indicate
than at the effect which has been produced by the com-
pressed publication of its results. What strikes one most
in reading the MSS. is that which also strikes one most
in reading the published risum( that has grown out of

themnamely, the honest adherence throughout to the
strictly scientific, or, as the followers of Comte would say
positive method of seeking and interpreting facts; specu-
lation, hypothesis, and straw-splitting are everywhere, not
so much intentionally avoided, as alien to the whole con-
ception of the manner in which the sundry problems are
to be attacked. We all know that this conception has

years with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune
with no practice at all, he might truly be said to have
done so instinctively. But it would be a serious error to
suppose that the greater number of instincts have been
acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted
by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly
shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we
are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of
many ants, could not possibly have been acquired by
habit.1
"It will be universally admitted that instincts are as
important as corporeal structures for the welfare of each
species, under its present conditions of life. Under
changed conditions of life, it is at least possible that
slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a
species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary
ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selec-
tion preserving and continually accumulating variations
of instinct to any extent that was profitable. It is thus,
I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful
instincts have originated."

Briefly, then, in Mr. Darwin's view instincts may arise
by lapsing intelligence, by natural selection of accidental
and possibly non-intelligent variations of habit, or by
both principles combinedseeing that "a little dose of
judgment" is often commingled with even the most fixed
(or most strongly inherited) instincts. One good test of
the truth of the view as a whole is that which Mr. Darwin
has himself suppliednamely, searching through the
whole range of instincts to see whether any occur which
are either injurious to the animals exhibiting them, or
beneficial only to other animals. Now there is really no
authentic case of the former, and the latter are so few in
number that they may reasonably be regarded, either as
rudiments of instincts once useful (so analogous to the
human tail), or as still useful in some unobservable
manner (so analogous to the tail of the rattlesnake). The
case of aphides secreting honey-dew for the benefit of
ants occurred to Mr. Darwin as one which might be
adduced against his theory in this connection, and he
therefore made some experiments upon the subject, which
led him to conclude that "as the excretion is extremely
viscid, it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to
have it removed; therefore probably they do not excrete
solely for the good of the ants."
A discussion of the variability of instinct, and of the
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
probability that variations should be inherited, leads him
to consider the important case of the apparent formation
of artificial instincts in our domestic dogs by continued
training with selection, and also the not less important
case of the effects produced upon natural instincts by the
long-continued change of environment to which other of
our domestic animals have been exposed. All the facts
adduced as resulting from these long-continued though
unintentional experiments by man, go to substantiate, in
a very unmistakable manner, the theory concerning the
origin and development of instincts which we are con-
sidering. The chapter concludes with a close considera-
tion of some of the more remarkable instincts which occur
in the animal kingdom, such as the parasitic instinct of
the cuckoo, the slave-making instinct of ants, and the
cell-making instinct of bees. A flood of light is thrown
1 Because the individuals which exhibit them, being neuters, can never
have progeny. It is indeed surprising, as Mr. Darwin further on observes,
that no one previously "advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects
against the well-known doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by
Lamarck."

large classes of phenomena which had been previously
wholly unintelligible.
"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Ani-
mals " is an essay which may be more suitably mentioned
in the present article than in any of the preceding. The
work is a highly interesting one, not only on account of
its philosophical theories, but also as an extensive accu-
mulation of facts. "The three chief principles " enunciated
by the former are: (1) " the principle of serviceable asso-
ciated habits "; (2) "the principle of antithesis "; and (3)
"the principle of actions due to the constitution of the
Nervous System, independently from the first of the Will,
and independently to a certain extent of Habit." It is
shown that the first of these principles leads to the per-
formance of actions expressive of emotions because " cer-
tain complex actions are of direct or indirect service
under certain states of mind, in order to relieve or gratify
certain sensations, desires, &c.; and whenever the same
state of mind is induced, however feebly, there is a ten-
dency through the force of habit and association for the
same movements to be performed, though they may not
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
then be of the least use." The second principle arises
because, " when a directly opposite state of mind is in-
duced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the
performance of movements of a directly opposite nature,
though these are of no use; and such movements are in
some cases highly expressive." And the third principle
occurs because '' when the sensorium is strongly excited,
nerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in
certain definite directions, depending on the connection
of the nerve-cells, and partly on habit." All these prin-
ciples are more or less well substantiated by large bodies
of facts, and although the essay, from the nature of its
subject-matter, is necessarily not of so transforming a
character in psychology as those which we have already
considered, and although we may doubt whether it gives
a full explanation of every display of expressive move-
ment, we think there can be no reasonable question that
the three principles above quoted are shown to be true
principles, and therefore that the essay is completely
successful within the scope of its purposes.
Lastly, we have to allude to the brief paper published
in Mind on the psychogenesis of a child. These notes
were not published till long after they were taken, so that
Mr. Darwin was the first observer, by many years, in
a department of psychology whichowing chiefly to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the attention which his other writings have directed to
the phenomena of evolutionis now being very fully
explored. The observations relate entirely to matters
of fact, and display the same qualities of thoughtfulness
and accuracy which are so conspicuous in all his other
work.
On the whole, then, we must say that Mr. Darwin has
left as broad and deep a mark upon Psychology as he has
upon Geology, Botany, and Zoology. Groups of facts
which previously seemed to be separate, are now seen to
be bound together in the most intimate manner; and
some of what must be regarded as the first principles of
the science, hitherto unsuspected, have been brought to
light. No longer is it enough to say that such and such
actions are the result of instinct, and so beyond the reach
of explanation ; for now the very thing to be explained is the
character and origin of the instinctthe causes which led to
its development, its continuance, its precision, and its use.
No longer is it enough to consider the instincts manifested
by an animal, or group of animals, as an isolated body of
phenomena, devoid of any scientific meaning because

animal fats known as "oleomargarine."
"Butterine," as the name would imply, is an imitation
butter which is largely imported into this country from
America and from Holland. "Oleomargarine" is prin-
cipally made in the United States by the patented process
of Mege-Mouries, which consists in heating disintegrated

is (to borrow a term of the metallurgists) "liquated out."
This is allowed to solidify, and "refined" by subjecting
it to pressure at a temperature of about 900 F. "Oleo-
margarine" is converted into "butterine" by adding
about 10 per cent, of milk to it and churning the mixture
colouring the product with annetto, and rolling it in ice
to "set" it. Some idea of the development of this
industry may be gleaned from the fact that Mr. Nimmo,
the chief of the United States Statistical Department
reported that the export of oleomargarine for the year

ending June 30, 1880, was close upon 19,000,000 pounds.
And this is probably under-estimated, as it is certain that
considerable quantities of "butterine" passed through
the Customs under the designation of butter. It is not
very easy to get data which are altogether trustworthy;
but looking to the rate of increase furnished by the sta-
tistics of previous years, it is probable that the present
export of oleomargarine from America is not less than
from 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 lbs. per annum. Oleo-
margarine was the subject of some discussion in the
House of Commons during the last session, and the
matter was again brought up a few nights ago in the form
of some interrogatories addressed to the President of the
Board of Trade.
It appears that oleomargarine has recently taken a new
departure, and that its use is no longer confined to the
manufacture of "butter substitute," or "butterine." Our
ingenious friends on the other side of the Atlantic have
discovered that a mixture of oleomargarine and blue
skim milk make what Mr. H. M. Jenkins, the Secretary
of the Royal Agricultural Society of England describes
as an excellent imitation of "American Cheddar." In-
deed, so excellent is the imitation, that competent judges
in the City and elsewhere informed Mr. Jenkins that

guished the oleomargarine cheese from ordinary Ameri-
can cheese, and that they valued it from 52J. to 56^. per
cwt. wholesale, and from 8^/. to gti. per lb. retail. Ameri-
can cheese of presumably legitimate origin is of course
a well-established article of importation into this country;
the estimated value of the cheese we import is upwards
of 5,000,000/., of which at least one-half is credited to
the United States; and " American Cheddar," "Ameri-
can Cheshire," "American Stilton," &c, are well-recog-
nised terms among retail provision dealers. We are now
to have "Imitation American Cheddar," "Imitation
American Stilton"Stilton and Cheddar,in fact, several
times removed; and Mr. Jenkins tells us that a very
extensive trade will be shortly established in these
articles, provided that their quality proves to be suffi-
ciently good for the English market. Samples of these
imitation cheeses have been examined by Dr. Voelcker,
the chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society, who pro-
nounces them to be perfectly wholesome articles of food.
If the "oleomargarine" which enters into their composition
be obtained from healthy fat or suet, there is, of course, no

of a work published at a small native press at a great
distance from the author. Still the misprints in this
work are quite unusually numerous, sometimes three in a
single line of French or German, sometimes four in a
single page of ordinary matter; this throws some doubt
on the accuracy of the printed Tables (which cover about
130 pp. folio). The complete Report must have included
about 29 plates (constant reference being made to them),
but only three are published; the absence of these plates
makes it often difficult, sometimes impossible to follow
the author's argument. Again, the want of uniform
transliteration of proper names causes difficulty in identi-
fying unfamiliar places, the same place being often spelt
in two or more ways {e.g. Shoaygheen, Shwaygheen,
Shwegyeen, &c.). There is a too frequent use of local
words (e.g. choung = river, eng  lake, &c), and also of
odd un-English words (e.g. divagation, prescinding, &c).
These are, however, trifling drawbacks compared with
the fact that the work is one of great value, combining
the results of unusual knowledge of the literature about
the Irrawaddi with probably unique practical knowledge

of the Irrawaddi Delta.
The work contains three very distinct subjects: 1, the
question of the sources of the Irrawaddi (Parts I. and II.);
2, the hydraulic works on the Irrawaddi (Part III.) and
Nawoon Rivers (Part IV.); 3, the theory of the flow of
water in rivers (Parts III. and IV.).
Sources of /he Irrawaddi.Parts I. and II. form a
monograph on the vexed question of the lower course of
the great Thibetan River (Tsanpou or Sanpo); its upper
course from west to east within the heart of the Him^lya
mountains has long been roughly known (by travellers'
reports), but its lower course beyond the Himdlya is still
strangely obscure. The Indian Survey maps have long
shown the Sanpo as continuous with the Brahmaputra.
But the author adopts the view of the great French geo-
grapher, D'Anville (circa 1730), that the Sanpo is the
upper course of the Irrawaddi. He discusses at great
length the general features of the Thibetan plateau and
of the Brahmaputra and Irrawaddi valleys, especially as
to the distribution of mountain and valley, and as to rain-
fall and river discharges. The chief argument is that
just above the debouchure of the highest known large
affluent (the Mogoung), a little above Bhamo, at a dis-
tance of 800 miles from the sea, the Irrawaddi is still an
immense river 1000 yards wide and with a flood discharge
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of over 1,000,000 cubic feet per second, and therefore
requiring a large drainage area above Bhamo. Now
within 100 miles above Bhamo, the five great rivers
Brahmaputra, Irrawaddi, Salween, Mekhong, and Yang-
tse-kiangare known to be contained within a narrow
strip of 200 miles width ; from this it would seem that the
sources of the Irrawaddi must be very distant (from the
want of numerous large affluents). By collating the
various travellers' accounts of the Sanpo, it is shown that
they are consistent with its being continuous with the
Irrawaddi.
Most of this appears to have been written in 1877. But
in 1877-78 the Indian Survey Department conducted
some special investigations on the question; their ex.
plorers traced the Sanpo downwards to within about 100
miles of the nearest regular survey party then at work on
the affluents of the Brahmaputra near the limits of British
territory; this gap of 100 miles was left a terra incognita,
so that the question was still open to conjecture. After
some discussion of this later work, it is shown rather to
favour the author's earlier writings.

discharge-measurements of the river nearly on the lines
of the Mississippi work, viz. by direct velocity-measure-
ments at numerous points of certain selected sites.
Besides the practical value of these as necessary data for
the embankment projects, the details may be of great use
in the study of the flow of water. And indeed this forms
the most interesting portion of the work in a scientific
sense, being a mass of original experiment on the flow in
a mighty river. Much credit is due to the author for the
zeal with which he had these experiments carried on for
several years, in the face of great difficulties and dis-
couragements. The experiments are discussed only so
far as necessary to explain the application of the results
(chiefly discharge-measurements) to the embankment
projects. A further special report upon the experiments
themselves is promised, which should be of great value.
The velocity-measurements appear to have been entirely
made with the "double-float,'' whereof the surface-float
was a wood disc 6"x6" X 1" joined by a cord Vic" thick, of
various lengths, to a cylindric wood sub-float 6"x6"xi2"
loaded with clay, and sunk to various depths from 1 to 24

metres. At moderate depths this instrument would be
pretty efficient; unfortunately the efficiency of all double-
floats decreases with the depth of immersion, and at the
greatest depth of 24 metres this one must have been very
inefficient; forsupposing even that the sub-float retained
its most favourable (the upright) positionthe relative
areas of connector and sub-float exposed to direct current-
action would be as 73 to 100, and to lateral current-action
as 52 to 100; so that the observed velocity of the instru-
ment was certainly not that of the current at 24 metres
depth (as it is taken to be). Notwithstanding the inherent
objections to the double-float, there seems to be as yet no
better instrument available for mighty rivers.
Two sorts of velocity-measurements were undertaken,
viz. (1) at one metre depth at many points (from 30 to 60)
across the channel; and (2) at every metre of depth upon
selected verticals in the channel. The latter were con-
sidered the more important. This sort of work must
necessarily have been very tedious in flood-seasons on a
mighty river; at such times only ten complete series
could be done daily; altogether about 10,000 such series
were done. This is a collection of experimental data
quite unique in river hydraulics, of which the author may
justly be;proud. From these data, together with the
cross-section figure, the discharges were computed; the

mode of computation seems to have been as good as the
data admit of.
The mode of presenting the results is open to some
objectione.g. many of the velocities are carried to four
decimals of feet per second, a degree of accuracy quite
unattainable; again the discharges are given in several
different forms, viz. in cubic feet per second, in cubic
metres, and also in tons and in "metre-tons" per day,
per month, and per year, and in some tables the unit is
not stated. The author points out that one cubic metre
of water weighs about 55 -i- 56ths of a ton, so that the
two measures (cubic metres and tons) may be used indif-
ferently with an error of less than 2 per cent., and he
emphasises this coincidence by the use of a new term,
"metre-ton"; but by all modern usage this term means
either the "moment of one ton of pressure at one
foot leverage," or the "work done in raising one ton
weight through one foot height," so that this new usage
is inconvenient.
As to the theory of running water some novel views are
brought forward. It is stated that, speaking broadly, two

The above is the title of a publication appearing in
monthly parts, each containing, in the words of the
prospectus, "four beautifully coloured plates and descrip-
tive letterpress." Part I. deals with common representa-
tives of the natural orders Caryophyllacea, Crucifera,
Fumariacea, Geraniacea, and Labiata.
We are perplexed as to the intentions of the author of
this work, which is advertised as designed "for the use of
medical schools and Universities." If the "Botanical
Atlas" is intended to supply candidates for certain ele-
mentary examinations with the facts absolutely necessary
for a "pass" certificate, it seems fair to expect accuracy
in the drawings of common objects.

The author, however, appears to think otherwise; not
only are there gross inaccuracies in the execution of the
conspicuous figures, but the types are ill-chosen and im-
perfectly referred to.
In illustration of this may be noted Fig. 2, on PI.
xiv., professing to represent a vertical section of the
common wallflower ; the reference "long stamen," points
to the anther of a short one, and the words "short sta-
men," are referred to a green band, which might be
imagined as intended for filament, petal, or sepal, and
seems to do duty for all three.
In the figures standing for other vertical sections of
flowerse.g. Fig. 3, PI. xvi., and Figs. 2 and 3, PI.
xxiii.no one can avoid noticing the mysterious vague-
ness in the lower portions of the drawings; the same re-
mark applies to the sections on PI. xv. Is the author
undetermined as to the relations of the parts composing
the androecium and gyncecium, or does he expect
students, for whom elaborately-coloured drawings of
sepals and petals have been prepared, to discover the
forms and relations of the smaller essential organs with-
out aidor, rather, in spite of the misleading caricatures
here placed like pitfalls in his path?
Similar faults are apparent in the diagrammatic plans
of the flowers, and one wonders at the ingenuity displayed

in going so far out of the way to prepare imperfect and
inaccurate drawings of common objects.
Among other equally ingenious misrepresentations may
be named Figs. 9 and 10, PI. xv.the marvellous streaks
in a somewhat oval frame (Fig. 11, PL xvi.) supposed to
represent a longitudinal section of the seed of Geranium,
the incomprehensible stigma in Fig. 8, PI. xxiii., with
reference to which we cannot agree with the author when
he says: "The figures will show the arrangement of the
parts better than any description."
Passing over such errors as Nostoe, Hydrodietyon
possibly printer's mistakesand the questionable mixtures
of Latin and English names, we may notice one or two
specimens of description appended to these gaily-tinted
plates. We are told, without further remark: "The
form and arrangement of the different parts (Fumitory)
are evidently suggestive of some purpose." Also, the
description of the wallflower commences: "Wallflower is
a universal favourite, no less from its beautiful colour
than from its sweet smell," and then passes on to a
highly condensed and imperfect synopsis. We are told

Mr. S. E. Peal, I may, therefore, be communicating stale infor7
¦nation; but as it is the result of personal experience, what I
have to relate may be of some use as confirmatory of statements
of others. Mr. Peal would not be able accurately to estimate
direction, unless the sense of hearingthe capacity to receive
soundwas precisely equal and similar in each ear. A greater
sensibility in one than in the other, would incline him to the
right, or the left, as the case might be.
Few people know that they may be partially deaf on one side,
and yet not perceive it, just as some are right- or left-eyed, with-
out knowing it. A good test is a watch slid along a two-foot
rule, the end of which touches the cheek. The watch is moved
away, inch by inch, till the ticking is no longer audibleif the
distance is the same on both sides, the sensibility of each ear is
of course equal.
I shall not forget my horror when my medical man, applying
this test, showed that while with my right ear I could distinguish
the ticks far beyond the 2 feet, my left ear was impervious to
the sound until within an inch or two of the watch. Hearing
on that side has now totally ceased, and the result is / have not
the slightest idea of the direction of sound. I can hear certain
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
sounds (for I am becoming deaf on the right side also), but to
whichever side I incline my right ear, from thence do I fancy
the sound to come.
To me, with my passion for ornithology, it is a terrible
deprivation. In my youth my senses were intensely acute. I
could instantly detect and proceed to the faintest note uttered by
a bird in the forest. Now the loudest call only puzzles me the
more. But I was a long time before I found this out. I
fancied more than once that the bird I was pursuing had powers
of ventriloquism; then that there were two or more, calling
from different directions. As soon, however, as I found, as
before stated, that I was deaf on one side, I began experiment-
ing on myself, and quickly arrived at the conclusion that in order
to estimate direction, both ears needed to be equally sensitive.
A curious instance of correct judgment as to direction and
distance of sound is given by one of the South African explorers,
Green, I think. He had been much annoyed by a lion which
roared rounn his camp. Taking his rifle and some of his native
followers, he went outside in the direction of the sound. Halting,
they listened intently, and at the next roar caught the exact direc-
tion, and judged the animal to be at (I think) about 300 yards.
Carefully levelling his rifle, he fired, and had the satisfaction of
hearing the well-known "thud " of the bullet, and a change of
note from the midnight serenader. Next morning showed
traces of blood, and following up the track they found, and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
despatched the wounded beast.
Colour-blindness is represented in the other sense, by an
inability to distinguish certain sounds. That this is caused by
partial deafness, 1 am now pretty well certain. My father-in-
law, who never knew he was deaf, never heard the chirrup of
the cricket, and I now find I cannot do so. Only last night my
wife observed "what a noise the crickets are making," to me
there was unbroken silence as regarded outward sounds. I only
heard the continuous "buzzing" that sounds in my head, aug-
mented by the regular "thud thud" of my pulse.
I have a clock, the hours of which strike on a sweettored,
metallic bell. If my right ear is turned towards it, at a mode-
rate distance, I hear the ringing note; if turned away, I am
only conscious of the " burr " of the works, and a dull "thud,
thud," deno'ing the stroke. Why do I hear the "burr," which
is not so loud, or clear, as the metallic "ting"? That wave of
sound seems to pass by and not affect me; it is like the sharp
note of the cricket.
The cause why certain sounds are inaudible to certain ears is
a subject well worthy of investigation, as bearing on the placing
of sentries or outposts at night, in time of war; also for sports-

point for every observed angle of position, the epoch in
years and decimals being measured as an abscissa along
the horizontal lines, and the angle in degrees as an ordi-
nate along the vertical ones. A series of points are thus
obtained, which, if the observations were exact, would
necessarily admit of a regular curve being drawn through
them, whose nature is of course determined by the laws
of elliptic motion, and one of whose essential characters
is to have within those limits of the abscissa, which
correspond to a whole period of revolution (that is, to a
difference of 360 units in the ordinates), in some cases
two, in some four, points of contrary flexure, but never
more than the latter, nor fewer than the former, and to
have, moreover, in all its points, a peculiarly graceful and
flowing outline. The errors of observation, however,
prevent the drawing of such a curve through all the
points. It must be drawn with a free but careful hand,
not through, but among the points, and so that it shall
deviate less from every point, according as it is more or
less reliable. Now after Herschel's time the accuracy of
the observed distances has wonderfully improved, and we

are therefore able to draw another curve representing the
distances as ordinates, which then ought to agree with
those deduced from the angles, and the angles ought to
agree with those deducible by aid of integral calculus
from the distances. The curves must be varied till they
thus mutually support each other, and then we may
construct any number of points of the apparent orbit by
reading off the angles and distances for the corresponding
epochs on the curves, and if we find the arc described
sufficiently extensive, the apparent ellipse is simply drawn
as nearly as possible through them. From the apparent
orbit the elements of the real orbit, described in space,
are then determined. These are seven in number :
a. The major semi-axis, expressed in seconds of arc,
i.e. the angle under which their mean mutual distance
would appear if placed perpendicular to the line of vision,
it. the straight line joining us with the star.
t. The eccentricity of the real ellipse.
y. The inclination of the plane of the real orbit to the
plane perpendicular upon the line of vision.
C. The node, i.e. the angle of position of the line in
which the plane of the orbit intersects the plane perpendi-
cular upon the line of vision.
it. The longitude of the projected peri-astron, i.e. the
angle of position of the companion at the epoch of its

actual nearest approach to the main star.
T. The epoch, when the nearest approach in space
occurs.
P. The period of revolution, i.e. the time it takes the
companion to complete an entire revolution round the
main star.
It is impossible to say what part of the orbit is inclined
towards us, and what is removed from us,1 we cannot
therefore, distinguish between an ascending and a de-
scending node.
Both before and after Herschel's investigations, several
methods of calculating double-star orbits have been pro-
posed. Savary, at Arago's request, was the first who gave
an analytical determination of an orbit from five points.
He also proposed a method, subsequently improved by
Encke, for calculating the seven elements of the real
orbit from four complete observations. These furnish
eight co-ordinates corresponding to known epochs, and
as only seven quantities, the elements are sought, the

the latter kind, the companion is generally bluish, and
the number of blue companions increases rapidly with
the distance, so that the close pairs are generally of the
same, more or less white colour, and not very different
in magnitude, whereas the wide pairs are of complemen-
tary colours, and the companion much fainter than the
primary. We see then that the brightness is, on the
whole, more different, the more different the colour isa circumstance first pointed out by Struve. Now it is well known that the colour of a solid or liquid cooling body
passes from white through yellow to red, and these are
the colours in which the single stars, without exception,
appear to us, whereas the blue and purple stars are found
only as small companions to brighter stars. Holden, in
Washington, has suggested that these colours are due to
absorptive atmospheresan opinion, the decision of which
we leave to spectroscopists. Pickering, in Cambridge,
U.S., has shown, from the absence of polarisation, that
they do not shine with reflected light.
The last remarks remind us of the planets, that, no
doubt, revolve round those distant suns, and derive from
them their light and heat. When we reflect upon the
complicated nature of the orbits, which the planets and
comets describe round our sun, we get some idea of how
remarkable must be the nature of those curves that

planets describe round double suns, compared to which
the motion of our moon is simple, and easily under-
stood. Perhaps the same comets that disappear to
our gaze, leaving the sphere of attraction of the sun,
are attracted, and for a time become members of
those wonderful systems. Our mathematics do not suffice for solving the problems that are thus suggested,
but it is not unlikely that, unless situated very close to
one or other of the sunsso close that the other appears
not much larger than a star, though comparable in bright-
ness to the nearest sunthe planets are whirled out in the
cold space by the gravitational influence of the other sun,
as very likely many a minor planet was ejected from
the solar system under the influence of jupiter. \Vhat
must be the nature of those worlds illuminated by two
different suns, one yellow and another purple? Now
rises the one, and all is clothed in yellow, now the other,
and illuminated from complementary sources, every object
appears in its natural colour. Then sets the yellow sun,
and what must be the diversity ofthe effects as it approaches
the horizon! And behold nature puts on a purple mantle.
Then also that sun sets, and in the darkness of night,
though there is seldom night where there are two suns,
the starry heavens are seen much the same there as here,
except perhaps for moons reflecting light from the dif-
ferentlyfcoloured suns. But stars that seem large to us

are hardly visible there, while our sun is perceived in the
telescopes of the mysterious beings that inhabit those
strange globes as only a faint star, and metaphysicians
there prove from a priori considerations to their atten-
tive pupils, that no life could bask in the feeble glare of
a single sunhow all would famish but for the oppo-
site effects ofthe two suns. And no doubt! life there is
heightened, and the wonders of nature are unravelled
by aid of and under the influence of the energy of several
suns, more highly developed science, seeing how glorious
is the creation on this poor orb, that is kept alive by but
one. Not only the play of colour must there be more
varied than here, but phenomena of which we have not
the faintest idea, must be produced also through the
action of heat, electricity, and magnetism.1 Indeed, upon
subjects like these, science gives no information, and we
may therefore give our fancy free reins. Oh! that we
did possess the power of appreciating these things like
the divine Milton, when in truly prophetic strain he

have appeared since 1864.

a greater thickness of the spongy mass that is the effective
agent in the storage process. In this development he had
been anticipated by d'Arsonval, who sought to increase
the efficacy of the oxidised lead electrode by covering it
with a layer of lead dross. De Meritens, Tommasi, and
others have worked in another direction by employing
many sheets of lead foil presenting a large amount of
surface, whilst Swan, Sillon, and Volckmar have taken
another departure in applying perforated plates of lead
with disintegrated material packed into the interstices.

short circuited by the possible falling down of the thin
corrugated strips which are rapidly disintegrated during

NATURE
SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE ECLIPSE
"THE following communication appeared in the Daily
*¦ News of Tuesday from its special correspondent
with the English Eclipse Expedition :
In my last letter,1 written as it seems, an age ago, for
the incidents since the eclipse have been more or less
emotional, I promised in a final one to give the opinions
of the astronomers as to the bearing of the work they
have been fortunate enough to do in Egypt this year upon
the general question of solar inquiry. Hence we have to
consider both results and methods, and the latter should
include the questions which it seems now most desirable
to put to the sun the next time he is eclipsed. First,
then, as to results. There seems good ground for sup-
posing that the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere
suffers changes as does that lower portion in which sun-
spots are observed, and that the changes synchronise.
Now, in the case of spots, as is generally known, we
have a maximum number every eleven years or there-
abouts, and in the interval we have a minimum, during
which no spots are seen for weeks together. Hence the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
so-called maximum sun-spot period and minimum sun-
spot period. This supposition was first hazarded in 1878,
a minimum sun-spot year, as a result of the comparisons
of the observations of that year with those obtained in
1871, a maximum sun-spot year. In 1871 the corona was
most extended away from the equator; there was no
special structure at the poles, and the hydrogen in it was
strongly developed and it was very luminous. In 1878
it was most extended along the equator; there was very
special structure at both poles, the hydrogen had almost
disappeared, and it was faint. Now in 1882, that is
eleven years from 1871 and in another maximum sun-
spot year, the corona has again put on its condition of
eleven years ago. Hence observation has shown that
the supposition is so far quite justified by the facts, and
accepting this connection as a working hypothesis astro-
nomers and physicists have now to try to connect the
absence of spots in the lower atmosphere with a condition
of things which gives us a great equatorial extension of
the atmosphere, and very definite structure at the poles,
associated in all probability with a lower temperature,
or at all events a greater admixture of cooling material.
Before the Eclipse Expedition had left England Dr.
Siemens had proposed a theory of the solar atmosphere
which postulated exactly such conditions as appeared to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be revealed in years of least solar activity. The coinci-
dence between hypothesis and fact was, to say the least,
extremely curious, and there is no doubt that the fact
that when the sun is most active the correspondence
seems to vanish, will have to be carefully considered.
But we have learned more touching the outer atmosphere
than its changes. There has been a chemical touch
added. When in 1869 its chemical nature was first in-
vestigated by means of the spectroscope, it seemed to be
built up almost entirely of a substance of which we
knew nothing herea substance revealed by a line in the
green part of the spectrum, at 1474 of the scale em-
ployed by Kirchhoff for his maps, which were then gene-
rally in use. In 1870 hydrogen was added to this unknown
substance, if we are to interpret spectroscopic phenomena
in the usual manner; and now again, with the same
proviso, calcium has been added; that is to say, some
lines seen in the spectrum of calcium have now been
detected in the spectrum of the sun's outer atmosphere.
It is now some years since the strange behaviour of
calcium when observed in the spectroscope was noticed,

elementary at solar temperatures. It will be seen that the
issue raised then could not be complained of as lacking
crispness and definiteness. What then are the facts?
The facts have been exactly as they were predicted on the
rival hypothesisthe hypothesis, namely,that the elements
are not elementary; and in future we are not likely to
hear much more of the "reversing layer." The solar
spectrum, indeed, appears now to be the result of the
absorptive work of an innumerable number of strata one
over the other, from top to bottom of the solar atmosphere.
If we could see the work of any one of these layers by
itself, it would be impossible for us, with our mere terres-
trial laboratory experience, to recognise it, whereas we do
recognise the sum total, because we get, and can only get
as a rule, a sum total in our laboratory experiments.
Should this result be generally accepted as one of the
results of this year's work a great step will have been
gained. Whether accepted or not, it is quite clear that
such observations as those to which attention has been
directed will demand much attention when next the sun
is eclipsed. Nor is this all. It is not too much to hope
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
now that M. Thollon has so admirably succeeded in
furnishing astronomers with a spectroscope which com-
bines the maximum of dispersion and light that observations
suggested by the new view may be made on the uneclipsed
sun and bring their tribute of precious facts every day the
sun shines. Such work, indeed, was actually started at
Sohag, and the test then afforded gave out no uncertain
sound; but on this point it is not necessary to enlarge
upon the present occasion, as both MM. Thollon and
Trdpied are pledged to utilise the beautiful climates of
Nice and Algiers in carrying on this new survey at the
earliest possible moment, and the world of science will
doubtless soon hear something of the result of this new
attack.
There is little doubt that on the occasion of future
eclipses attention will be much more concentrated on the
spectrum of the corona, and more specially-constructed
instruments will be brought to bear on it than has been
the case hitherto. We may already take for granted that
the blue lines photographically recorded (in addition to H
and K in the violet,) will have their position determined
with the greatest accuracy, and their coincidence or not
with marked Fraunhofer lines will have an important
bearing upon the questions to which attention has been
directed in the present letter. The work, too, has shown
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
that the new plates are so sensitive that it will be quite
easy at the next eclipse by means of a circular rotating
plate, or some such contrivance, to record all the spectro-
scopic phenomena, however evanescent they may be,
visible at the moment of disappearance or reappearance
of the sun. Such a method will not only give us a com-
plete history of what goes on, but will furnish us with a
scale of exact reference. So science advances. Each
effort, and especially the one most wisely planned, instead
of exhausting the supply of new phenomena brings still
newer efforts and richer harvests in its train.
I have been very unfaithful to the task imposed upon me
if I have not convinced your readers that the expeditions
whose work it was my duty to chronicle have been richly
rewarded for their long preparations and tedious journey-
ings. They will all leave Egypt with the liveliest sense
of gratitude for the manner in which all their efforts for
the advancement of knowledge among men have been
seconded by the Khedive and the Egyptian Government.

for export from its surface. Some blocks have already arrived
at the latter place, and as the quality of the ice has been found
to be good, large shipments may be expected. The glacier is
about 120 square miles, and as the distance from its border to
the sea is only a couple of miles, the ice may be obtained very
cheaply. A similar attempt to utilise the glacier Folgefonden

sion and declination that were recorded on the night in question.
This explanation we considered a probable one, and the same
view was taken by the editor of the Astroiwmische NackricJittn,
which has occasioned a further communication on the subject
from Dr. Gould, who rejects Mr. Tebbutt's suggested solution of
the difficulty.
Dr. Gould says the appearance of the comet on June 11 pre-
cluded the slightest doubt as to its identity. "The tail itself
could not be seen with the telescope, it is true, but the large,
diffuse, and very elongated head, much brighter and more
definite on the advancing side, was sufficient to enable the

veriest tyro to recognise it as a comet." He was placed neces-
sarily on the top of a high observing chair, which he did not
leave during the observations, the records being made by his
as-istant. He had made several sweeps to find a suitable com-
parison-star, and was about to commence a new one, when he
saw the object referred to above, "at the upper part of the field
on the left, while the comet was on the right, below." The
four published comparisons were then made, and whilst he was
in the act of pointing the micrometer-thread upon the comet for
a fifth, it disappeared below the horizon. He adds, that no jar
of the instrument had taken place; "the field of the telescope
was fully under control from the beginning, the declination-
clamp remaining tight throughout," and he insists that no one
who saw the comet could have entertained the idea that any
am >unt of blurring could have given such an aspect to a fixed
star, though it were far brighter than A Eridani. And he doubts
whether a star of the sixth magnitude would have been visible
under the circumstances. He made experiments on subsequent
evenings, by looking at known stars of different magnitudes
when close to the horiz >n and through different degrees of haze,
but in no case did he find one offer the appearance noted on
June 11. Hence, he proceeds: "I can only suppose another
comet to have been in the field. That it was not a companion-
comet is manifest, not only from the relative motion, and from
an examination made the next day, but still more from the abun-

dant scrutiny in the northern hemisphere, which could not have
failed to detect any companion. That it was not a fixed star,
wa< evident from the beginning."
Thus the matter is left by Dr. Gould, who, it must be ad-
mitted, is by far the most competent judge of the probable
explanation of the difficulty.

ON SMELL
THE sense of smell is caused by the contact of certain sub-
stances with the terminal organs of the olfactory nerves,
which are spread as a network over a mucous membrane lining
the upper part of the nasal cavity. Each nerve consists of a
number of small bundles, themselves capable of being split into
extremely fine nerve fibres. There are spindle-shaped cells con-
nected with these nerves, from which proceed two processes-
one to the surface, provided with bundles of long hairlets; the
other passes to the interior. It is these hairlets which are pro-
probably the proximate cause of smell. Let us consider, first, by what are smells excited? The
operation of smelling is performed hy snifiio, that is, by a
series of short inhalations of air, bearing with it the odorous
body. The first question which suggests itself is: Is the sub-
stance which excites sensation a liquid, solid, or gas? It has
been tried by Weber, to fill the nose with eau~de-Cologne and
water, lying on the back for that purpose, and pouring the liquid
into the nostrils by a funnel. No sensation is produced. I
have myself tried the experiment, and can confirm his observa-

tion. There is an irritating feeling, but no smell. Of course,
on washing out the nose, or blowing it, the characteristic smell
is at once noticeable.
It is easy to prove that solid particles are not the cause of
smell. If the air conveying the odour be filtered through a tube
filled with cotton wool, and inserted into the nose, a smell is
still discernible, although all solid particles must thereby be kept
back. But it is a very remarkable circumstance that it is so, for
one would not suspect such extremely non-volatile substances as
copper, iron, silver, &c, to give off gas, if indeed the smell
which they most certainly evolve when rubbed is due to the gas
of the substance.
We must, therefore, conclude that the sense of smell is ex-
cited by gases only. It is of course necessary to include under
the name gases the vapours of liquids or solids which have low
vapour-tension, and which, in consequence, give off vapour at
the ordinary temperature. It has been proved that this is the
case even with mercury, the boiling point of which is over 300'
Centigrade. We may consequently conclude that many other
substances of which it is impossible to measure the vapour-ten-
sion at ordinary temperatures, owing to its extreme minuteness,

easier to classify carbon compounds. The smell of the paraffins
is generic; so is that of the alcohols, the acids, the nitriles, the
amines with their irritation like that of ammonia, the bases of
the pyridine series, the hydrocarbons of the benzene group, the
higher hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene, anthracene, and
phenanthrene. Give any one of these to a chemist familiar with
the smell of any one of each series, and accustomed to use
his sense of smell, and he will at once refer the body to its
class.
The tendency of a rise in the series is to make the smell
"heavier," less ethereal, and more characteristic. It also
becomes more able to affect the olfactory nerves.
The rate at which smell travels is doubtless the rate at which
the vapour which gives rise to it diffuses. Still it is impossible
to test this experimentally. For the ease with which a smell is
perceived varies with the molecular weight of the substance.
Thus, if a piece of cotton wool be impregnated with ethyl
alcohol, and placed in one end of a long tube, which is imme-
diately corked, and a similar arrangement be adopted with amyl-
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
alcohol, the fifth of the series of which the former is the second;
although their specific gravities have the ratio of 23 to 44, and
the ethyl-alcohol should diffuse l| times as rapidly as amyl-
alcohol, yet the smell of the latter will be perceived first, because
a much smaller quantity produces the sensation.
It is possible, with practice, to make a fairly accurate analysis
by means of the sense of smell. The method is, knowing the
constituents of a mixture, to prepare one which has the fame
smell, measuring the proportions of the ingredients. The only
precaution to be observed is that the smell of no member of the
mixture be so overpowering as to mask those of the others.
Thus I have analysed, or rather synthesised, a mixture of
chloroform with ether, alcohol with ether, and these liquids
with carbon disulphide, provided the latter be pure, to within
2tper cent. ; but I failed with members of the pyridine series.
Yet it was possible to detect the proportions of members of that
series to each other; and it is not difficult, however extraordinary
it may appear, to guess approximately the boiling-point of a
mixture of members of a series, after some practice, purely by
its smell.
So far as I know, no theory has been brought forward to
account for the sense of smell; and I therefore venture to supply
this want, premising that what follows is merely a tentative
explanation, and as such will, I hope, not be too severely
criticised.

There is a probability that our rense of smell is excited by
vibrations of a lower period than those which give rise to the
sense of light or heat. These vibrations are conveyed by gaseous
molecules to the surface network of nerves in tbe nasal cavity.
The difference of smells is caused by the rate and by the nature
of such vibrations, just as difference in tone of musical sounds
depends on the rate and on the nature of the vibration, the
nature being influenced by the number and pitch of the
harmonies.
Let us see what evidence can be adduced for the theory.
Among the lightest substances which have smell are sulphuretted
hydrogen and phosphoretted hydrogen, both of which are seven-
teen times as heavy as hydrogen itself. Prussic acid is fifteen
times as heavy as hydrogen, and has a smell. But all persons
are not able to perceive it. I have remarked an average of one
in every five persons who are totally unable to detect its odour.
Here we reach the lowest limit of molecular weight. To produce
the sensation of smell, then, a substance must have a molecular
weight at least fifteen times that of hydrogen. If we compare the
hydrocarbons of the paraffin series, with each other, and simi-
larly the olefine series, we notice that the lower members have

rately from the fundamental, unless special means be adopted to
render them audible, but they add their vibrations to those of
the fundamental.
When two sounds are heard simultaneously, they give a con-
cord, or a discord, but each may be separately distinguished by
the ear. Two colours, on the other hand, produce a single
impression on the eye, and it is doubtful whether we can analyse
them. But smell resembles sound and not light in this particular.
For in a mixture of smells, it is possible, by practice, to distin-
guish each ingredient, and as I have shown, to match the sensa-
tion by a mixiure.
With regard to the mechanism by which smell is conveyed to
the nerve, all that can be said is pure speculation. But as it is
supposed that the vibrations of sound are conveyed to the auditory
nerve through the small cirrhi, or hairs which spring out of
round cylindrical nerve-cells in the superficial layer of connective
tissue of the epithelium of the internal ear, and that each is
attuned to some particular note of vibrations, so it may be
imagined that the hair-like processes connected with the spindle-
shaped cells, themselves communicating with the nerve-fibres of
the olfactory nerve, are the recipients of the vibrations causing

smell. Although the rate of such vibrations is extremely rapid, no
less indeed in the case of hydrogen than 4,400,000,000,000,000,
or the four quadrillions, four trillionth part of a second, yet the
wave length is by no means so small, for it averages the 2-looth
of an inch, a magnitude quite visible with the naked eye. And
hydrogen has no smell; those bodies which have smell, and
higher molecular weight, must necessarily have a slower period
of vibration, and possibly greater wave-length.
It is doubtful whether there exists a lower limit to our sense of
smell. The vapours of osmic acid, carbon tetrabromide, sele
nium, tellurium, and arsenicous and antimonious oxides are
among the heaviest known, and they have a most distinct smell.
There appears to be a limit in practice, however, owing to the
non-volatility of substances of high molecular weight at such
temperatures at which smell may be perceived. The intense
perfume of flowers is to be ascribed to the terpenes, of which
common turpentine is one, or to their products of oxidation, and
these bodies all possess a molecular weight of 136, and the
specific gravity 68, a specific gravity which appears to excite the
olfactory nerve most powerfully.
I bring forward the theory adduced with great diffidence.
The problem is to be solved, in my opinion, by a careful measure-
ment of the "lines" in the spectrum of heat-rays, and the calcu-
lation of the fundamentals, which this theory supposes to be the
cause of smell. Such measurements and calculations, even if

they proved the theory untenable, would have great value for
their own sake, and labour expended in this direction would not
be lost. Whether successful or not, it would at least be a first

iced or hot water until the bridge is balanced. The temperature
of the water in the vessel is then read by a mercurial ther-

mander Bartlett's experiments. The apparatus was set up on
board the Blake in April, 1881, and experiments were made off
the east coast during August. In each series of experiments
the temperatures at different depths were first taken by Miller-
Casella thermometers attached to a sounding wire. A sinker
was then fastened to the resistance coil, and it was lowered by
the cable to the same depths, and the temperature read by means
of the mercurial thermometer attached to the comparison coil.
The depths at which readings were taken ranged from the sur-
face down to 800 fathoms, and experiments were made both in
rough and still water. The temperatures recorded varied from
38-5* to 8l'S° F. In every case the readings of the electrical
instrument were precisely the same as those of the Miller-Casella
thermometers for the surface and the maximum depth; but for
intermediate positions it was observed that the electrical thermo-
meter in almost every case gave a slightly higher reading. This
discrepancy may be accounted for, I think, by the circumstance
that the electrical thermometer gives the temperature of the
water actually surrounding the coil at the moment of observa-
tion, whereas the Miller-Casella instrument brings to the surface,
or at least its readings are effected by, the maximum or minimum
temperatures encountered in its ascent or descent, which may
not coincide with that at the point of stoppage. This furnishes
a very strong argument in favour of the superior accuracy of the
electrical instrument.

It was found that about five minutes must be allowed at
each observation for the resistance coil to assume the temperature
of the water surrounding it, and a second period of five minutes
for adjusting the temperature of the comparison coil on deck.
Allowing five minutes more for lowering the cable, fifteen
minutes sufficed to complete a deep sea observation.

THE FUNERAL TENT OF AN EGYPTIAN
QUEEN
The Funeral Tent of an Egyptian Queen. By Villiers
Stuart, of Dromana, M.P. (London: John Murray,
1882.)
THE startling discoveries of the royal mummies in
the pit of the Deir-el-Bahari has already been the
subject of great interest, and cast an unexpected light on
the history of embalming and the vicissitudes of the dead
as well as the living, revealing the unexpected transport
of the monarchs from their costly chambers and sarco-
phagi of the Biban-el-Molouk to the Deir-el-Bahari in
the fifth year of a monarch named Herhor, of the 21st
dynasty, one of that line of ambitious pontiffs who, at a
time of national decay, mounted the Egyptian throne.
That the tomb of the Deir-el-Bahari was the resting-place
of Herhor himself and his family appears from the dis-
covery of their mummies at the same site along with 6000
sepulchral objects, some of which are already filtering to
Europe, and others discovered at least ten years ago,
already enrich the collections of the Louvre. The nume-

rous duplicates of the smaller and portable objects can
neither be all retained in the country, nor is it desirable
they should be in the interests of science, for the interest
would be languid which allowed them all to remain on
the banks of the Nile. The reason why these archaeolo-
gical treasures were deposited in the Deir-el-Bahari is
quite uncertain, and as the hieratic inscriptions on the
shrouds only speak of their removal and condition, the
cause is likely for the present to remain undiscovered.
The Deir-el-Bahari was built by Thothmes I., II., Hatasu,
the ambitious queen, and her warlike brother Thothmes
III., as it was a spot especially favoured by the 18th
dynasty. Probably the 21st dynasty was descended by
the female line from the 18th, for families do not readily
become extinct in that direction, and there are living
descendants of the Plantagenets at the present day. The
resumption of the titular names of the 18th dynasty by
the 21st also points to a connection between the two
families, although it is difficult to conceive the precise
point from which it started. As however the first monarch
of the 21st had been a prince of Kush or /Ethiopia, and
these princes or viceroys were continued in a lineal
descent during the 18th and 19th dynasties, it may
perhaps be the case that Pinotem I. and II. were de-
scended by that family from the monarchs of the 18th

dynasty.
It is not necessary to dwell on the mummies, but some
of the facts mentioned by Mr. Villiers Stuart in his work
are remarkable, such for example as the wailing of the
Arab women along the Nile on their removal by the
steamers to the Museum of Boulaq, for although pro-
fessional mourners the lamentations of these women were
spontaneous and gratuitous. On the arrival of the
mummies at Cairo, that of Thothmes III. was unrolled,
and that illustrious soldier, a little man, a martial
pigmy of the most fragile mould, far more fragile than
the flowers with which he was surrounded, vanished
like a dream after, as it is said, a rapid photograph had

been taken of his features, so that only a carte de visite
of his remains has been left for posterity. Rameses IL

six feet, but he has not been unrolled, the loss of
Thothmes III. having discouraged the Boulaq authorities,

with a hieroglyphical inscription, the purport of which
appears to be that the queen in the future state was in the
arms of Khonsu, one of the deities of Thebes, son of
Mut and Amsn, " redolent with perfumes sweet as those of
Punt" the present Somili or Guariafui, and "crowned
with flowers." Those found in the coffins of this period,
and which still preserved their original colours, have been
determined to be blue larkspur, yellow mimosas, or
acacias, and the white lotus, besides which, according to
Mr. Stuart, a moss was discovered in the coffins resem-
bling a kind found only in Greece. The coloured plate
of the canopy which accompanies this part of the work
gives an idea of the brilliancy of this remarkable piece of
leather embroidery as it appeared nearly three thousand
years ago. Specimens of this leather canopy, which have
been brought to England, show that the colours with which
it was painted or dyed still retained their original lustre.
From some unknown circumstance they have, like the
flowers, never paled by the effects of time.

In his commentary on the text, which it is unnecessary
to follow here in detail, Mr. Stuart has given an account
of the scarabaeus, known as the Copris Isidis of Savigny,
and detailed a fact not generally known or described in
the account of that insect. Instead of propelling the clay
ball or pellet or the dung cased in with clay as the other
kinds of this family are saiito do with their hind legs, the
mile Copris Isidis carries the bill on its head and neck,
for which the peculiar formations of the horns and pro-
jections of the thorax are specially adapted. One has
been found wending its wiy over the ground with its
spherical load, another has been knocked down bearing it
as the beetle hummed his drony flight through the air.
Besides the description of the leather pall, Mr. Stuart
gives some account of the recently discovered pyramid of
Pepi at Sakkarah and that of Haremsaf. The interior
of these pyramids, unlike any of the others, was covered
with incised inscriptions coloured green, a peculiarity
seen also on some sepulchral tablets. The inscriptions
of these pyramids are mythological phrases, consisting of
formulas like those of the Ritual comparing the passage
of the soul of the deceased kings after death through the
heavens to the movement of the constellation Orion and
the course of Sothis or the Dog Star. Amongst the other
new facts mentioned in these inscriptions is that of the

tree of life, which is placed in the island of the blest
amongst the pools of the fields of the Aahlu or Egyptian
Elysium. A new light is shed on the earlier mythology
by these texts, which chiefly turn on the Nut or goddess
of the Ether, from whom Osiris and the monarch in the
character of that god is descended. These remarkable
texts have been translated by Brugsah-Bey, and Lauth.
It is much to be regretted that these inscriptions are so
entirely religious, and that these earliest of hieroglyphic
monuments offer no contribution to the history of that
remote period, Meidoum, is surrounded by tombs, in one
of which the author found the name of Senofru of the

sepulchre from other sources has failed like all the earliest
works of Egypt; for the passage is uninstructive, some
scribes of a later age have scrawled or scratched a
memorandum of a visit, but the walls are otherwise silent,
and the chamber has not been found in which t he royal
tenant was deposited. The mastabas of the age do not

Hydrographical Surveyings a Description of the Means
and Methods employed in constructing Marine Charts.
By Capt. W. J. L. Wharton, R.N. (London: Murray,
1882.)
CAPT. WHARTON, who has had considerable ex-
perience in nautical surveying, having been in
command of surveying vessels for nearly ten years, has
devoted his time, during the short interval he has been
unemployed, to writing a work on this part of the naval
profession which he modestly describes, in his preface,
as an endeavour to collect together information, which
has existed for years in a traditionary form amongst sur-
veyors, for the benefit of young officers who may wish to
devote themselves to surveying work in the future.
A book of this sort was certainly much needed as since
the time of Sir Edward Belcher, only one treatise has
been written by a naval surveyorCapt. R. Mayne, R.N.,
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
C.B. and we think Capt. Wharton deserves the thanks
of the profession for his exertions, and we hope to see
his work adopted as the text-book for instruction at the
Royal Naval College.
Before however reviewing Capt. Wharton's treatise
we propose to state briefly what we consider to be the
requirements of a nautical survey.
The perfection of marine surveying appears to us to be
the representation in a graphic form, readily understood,
of the coasts and harbours of the world with their various
off-lying dangers ; marking distinctly the various features
of high and low water lines, showing the dangers to be
avoided and the channels available for navigation, placing
prominently on the chart those objects on the land which
serve best to ascertain the position of a ship, and subor-
dinating all other features to these objects, so that the
channels to be used, and the marks by which those
channels can be recognised, are easily distinguished ; as
well as representing the set of the tides and currents and
the errors of the compass. To execute such a survey it
is evident considerable care must be bestowed in ascer-
taining accurately the positions of the land marks, as on
these depend the whole of the work, but this accuracy
need not be carried to such a degree of minuteness that it
cannot be shown on the chart; for, after all, the principal
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
object of a chart is to show the soundings; and enough
care has been bestowed on the land-marks if their posi-
tions are ascertained with sufficient precision for sound-
ings. Of course circumstances occasionally arise when,
from other causes, it may be advisable to modify this
arrangement, but not for the purpose of navigation.
Capt. Wharton appears to have kept these objects
steadily in view in writing his work. The work com-
mences with a description of the instruments used in
nautical surveying, which, although previously given by
Heather and by Simms, cannot be considered out of place,
and then gives a description of marine surveying in general
afterwards entering into particulars. We regret that in
the description of the sextant the important errors of
centering and graduation have been overlooked.
We much commend the following remark at p. 54, too
often ignored by surveyors:" The accuracy necessary
in many details of a chart depends very much upon its
scale. Over-accuracy is loss of time. Any time spent in
obtaining what cannot be plotted on the chart is, as a
rule, loss of time."

NATURE
By taking advantage also of the bright planets passing
the meridian in the day time good observations can be
obtained for latitude and longitude at the same time (a
great point), whilst the sun is above the horizon, as well
as at sunrise and sunset, when by Sumner's method three
or more stars can be combined to give the position. We
admit that constant practice is required to take these
observations accurately, but they can be obtained, and as
it is very useful to be able to make certain of a ship's
position, as often as possible, all officers should practise
themselves in observing both Venus and Jupiter with the
sun above the horizon.
Whilst however not agreeing with Capt. Wharton on
some few points, we think his work will be found most
useful, not only for young officers taking up surveying
but also as a book of reference for older surveyors, and
personally feel much obliged to him for combining in one
volume so many useful remarks and tables which have
hitherto been only in MSS. or pamphlets.

which is demonstrated the Theory of Quadrupedal
Locomotion. By J. D. B. Stillman, M.A., M.D. Exe-
cuted and Published under the Auspices of Leland
Stanford. (London : Triibner and Co., 1882.)
THE above is the somewhat long title of a large and
important work issuing from the well-known Cam-
bridge (U.S.) University Press. Long as is the title, the
name of the principal contributor to the volume is left
unrecorded there, though indeed even a cursory glance
over its contents shows how much indebted is the whole
question of the mode of motion in the horse to the
elaborate series of investigations of Mr. J. Muybridge.
Leaving aside the anatomical and teleogistic arguments
of Dr. Stillman, as contained in some hundred pages of
letterpress, we cull from a postscript to the same the fol-
lowing interesting information, which we give as we find it
in the book. Some time in 1872, Mr. L. Stanford, of Palo
Alto Farm, in California, had his attention called to the
very controverted question as to the action of a trotting
horse, and conceiving the idea that the photographic
camera might be made available to illustrate the action,
he, according to the authority before us, consulted with
Mr. Muybridge and induced him to undertake some
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
experiments in instantaneous photography. Some ten
years ago, a photograph taken in the space of the one-
twelfth of a second was considered quite a success, and
it would seem that the experiments made then by Mr.
Muybridge were inconclusive. In 1877 Mr. Muybridge,
however, renewed his experiments. A few pictures were
taken of "Occident," a noted trotter belonging to Mr.
Stanford, while he was in motion, and one of these, re-
presenting the horse with all his feet clear of the ground
was enlarged, retouched, and distributed. This result
was so extraordinary and so successful, that it was
determined to try others on a more extended scale. It
was assumed that if one picture could be taken instan-
taneously, an indefinite number might also be taken,
and so the various positions assumed by the horse in a
single complete stride could be illustrated.
Mr. Muybridge was authorised to procure the needed
apparatus, and a building suitable to the purpose was
erected on Mr. Stanford's farm. By 1878 preparations
were complete, and every resource of the photographic
art had been provided. Twelve cameras were placed in

A survey of the Ab-washur water-parting, between
Bashkurd and Hormuz Strait, considerably reduced the
supposed eastward extension of the Mindb basin, and
showed conclusively that it was in no way connected
with the Bampur River, which many geographers have
hitherto made to discharge through the Mindb into the
Persian Gulf. Mr. Floyer now argues with much force
that the true outlet of the Bampur is the Sadfch (Sadaich),
which reaches the coast in 58° 40' E., in the Gulf of
Omdn, and which seems to flow from the Shahri country,
through the Shimsani Pass, in the Band-i-Marz range.
He found that where he crossed the Haliri in 28° N.,
57° 40' E., it was already a considerable stream, 90 feet
broad, and 4^ feet deep. The furthest head-waters of
this important river, of which next to nothing was pre-
viously known, are in the Jemal Bariz range, whence it
flows in a south-easterly direction to the Rudbar and
Shahri districts. Here it would be almost necessarily

joined by the Bampur River, coming from the north-east,
and the united stream, whose further course has hitherto
remained an unsolved problem, would appear to flow
thence through the Shimsani Pass southwards to the
Sadfch. Hence the Sadfch would seem to be the lower
course of the Haliri-Bampur, thus draining nearly the
whole of the region in south-east Persia, between 570-
6i° E., and 25° 30'- 29° N. But this interesting point
cannot, of course, be finally determined without a more
thorough exploration of the Rudbar and Shahri districts
between Bampur and the Ab-washur water-parting.

written in a pleasant, vivacious style, and contains much

be impossible to furnish here the results of a thorough

Himalayan zone is found to be associated, not only with the
subsequent conditions already named, but also with an initially,
and therefore according to experience subsequently weak south-
west monsoon, which in its turn invariably causes local, if
not general drought and famine. These heavy snowfalls are
found to have a tendency to recur at the minimum sun-spot
epochs, and are proximately due to some condition of the upper
anti-monsoon current, at present not exactly known, by which a
larger amount of vapour is deposited in the winter, on the
Himalaya as snow, and on the North Indian plains as the
"winter rains."
It does not appear that we can so readily account for the
occurrence of the present ice-floes off Ireland or for the large
masses which have been encountered this spring in the Western
Atlantic. They must however to some extent be due to the
unusually warm winter which seems to have prevailed pretty
uniformly over the North Atlantic and North-West Europe, and
which has detached a larger proportion than usual of the Arctic
ice-fields. And though it is improbable that we shall find any
such regular periodicity in the amount of these ice-floes in the
Atlantic as in that of the Indian winter snows and rains, it is

It is also interesting to notice that in 1862 Heis's " Wochen-

"a noticeable cooling of the weather in June over Europe."
And it is farther significant to find in a detailed list of the ice met
with every month in the Atlantic by ships belonging to the North
German lines from i860 to 1869, that 1868 and 1869 (the year in

Though I agree with Dr. Hann in attributing more importance
to the tropical than to the polar area, in influencing the general
weather of these latitudes, I think it very probable on theoretical
grounds that we are relatively more influenced by the latter
area in summer and by the former in winter, and that just as it
has been inferred that the regular recurrence of periods of
diminished temperature in Europe, is due to the regular move-
ments of the ice in the polar area so we may reasonably conclude
that abnormal movements of the ice, especially in the Spitzbergen
area, are likely to produce periods of abnormal coolness such as
that which at present prevails. In any case the moral to be
drawn, if we re illy do intend to solve the weather problem, is by
all means to have a meteorological station in Iceland, and
endeavour to study the weather as we are fortunately able to do
in India, on a large scalt, instead of merely confining our attention
to the minute range of conditions we are able to observe within
the limited area of these islands.

although the sealskin trade occupied thousands of hands,
and had done so for at least a century previous, yet next
to nothing was known of the animal producing the skins,
and there was not, even in the museum of the Smith-
sonian Institution, a perfect skin and skeleton thereof.
This state of things has happily now vanished, and
through the joint action of Prof. Spencer Baird and the
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, Mr.
Henry W. Elliott, was enabled to visit the Pribylov
Islands in 1872, and we cannot but admire the zeal and
energy which enabled him to reside in these dreary and
desolate places all through the seasons of 1872 to 1874
inclusive. While a brief digest of Mr. Elliot's notes were
published in 1874, it is only now that he has been
enabled to publish a complete monograph on the subject,
an emended copy of which, reprinted from the Report on
the Fishery Industries of the Tenth Census at Washington
in this year, is now before us. It forms a quarto volume
of some 176 pages, and is illustrated by two maps and
twenty-nine plates of subjects from the author's pencil.
The writer's opportunities for observation, it will be
noticed, were especially good. The previous observa-
tions of Stellar and others left much to be desired. The
geographical distribution of the Arctic fur seal (Callo-
rhinus) is very peculiar. In the Arctic waters of the

waters of the Pacific they are virtually confined to four
islands in Bering's Sea, namely St. Paul and St. George
of the tiny Pribylov group, and Bering and Copper
Islands of the Commander group On the former two
they swarm. On the latter two, though the larger in
area, the seals do not occur in such quantities. It seems
impossible to avoid the reflection here as to the waste of
fur seal life in the Antarctic regions, and along the coasts
of South America, from which, as a centre, the Arctic
forms, probably, originally came. Not a century ago the
fur seals rested on the Falkland Islands in millions for
hundreds that are to be found there now, and it seems
hopeless to expect that a British parliament could, with
all its many labours, trouble itself to frame regulations,
such as the Russians and Americans have done, with
the object of repeopling, even in time, these splendid
breeding-grounds which, on the Falklands, lie in the very
track of commerce, and which, unlike the Alaskan Islands,
have beautiful and safe harbours.

This shows the increased ability and consequent celerity
of action among the natives.
Here it may be mentioned that by an Act of Congress
the exclusive right of taking a certain number of fur seals
every year for a period of twenty years on these islands
was granted to the Alaskan Commercial Company of San
Francisco, subject to certain reservations and conditions.
The Company seem to have done far more than they
were actually by law required, and the benefit to the
people has been no less great than to the Company; and
where it was simply impossible under the old state of
things to collect the lawful quota of 100000 seals' skins
annually in less than from three to four working months,
it is now done by the same amount of hands in less than
thirty days, and so the whole of the skins are preserved
at their prime, and it is rare that any of them are unfit to
be sent to London, whereas in comparatively recent years,
often as many as three-fourths were rejected; comment
on such an altered state of things is needless. Here it
may be interesting to note that almost all the raw seal
hides are sent to London, from whence, when dressed,

they are distributed all over the civilised world where furs
are worn. Our reader will surely know that the seal-
skins as worn by the seals and as offered for sale by the
furrier are very different-looking objects. Instead of the
sleak, glossy coats familiar to us, the sealskin when on its
own owner's back is a very unattractive thing, the fur not
being visible, but hidden away under a coat of stiff over-
hair, which is of a dark gray brown or grizzled colour.
Not only is this hair removed, but the whole fur is dyed.
The seal life on the Pribylov group consists not only of
the fur seal {Callorhinus ursinus), but also of the sea lion
Eumetopias SUlleri, the hair seal (Phoca vitulind). and
the walrus (Odobceiius obesus). Of these it is only the
first that is of any commercial value; but in this work we
have some very interesting sketches of the life and
manners of the others, and some very characteristic
portraits. As our space will not allow us to refer in detail
to these, we may here mention the fine figure of an old
male walrus, being a life study, forming Plate 21, and the
figures of the sea lions on Plate 16. The life studies of
the common hair seal on Plate 4 are also very excellent;
this animal, so common in the Atlantic, would appear to
be rare in the North Pacific. Although the skin of the
sea-lion has little or no commercial value, yet to the
natives it is most valuable; it supplies them not only

with its hide and flesh, but they also utilise its fat, sinews,
and intestines; its very lip bristles are in great demand
in China for pickers to the opium pipes, and for several
ceremonies peculiar to the joss houses. The walruses
are of little value unless for their hides; these are used
for covering the frames of boats, and when the latter are
thoroughly and constantly attended to they form the best
species of lighter that can be used on the islands, standing
more thumping and pounding than any sort of a wooden
boat or even than a corrugated iron lighter.
It is, however, the history of the fur seal that will
chiefly interest the readers of this volume. It repairs to
these islands to breed and to shed its hair and fur, in
numbers that seem almost fabulous. It seems to be an
animal of wonderful instinct; indeed, our author thinks
that few, if any, creatures in the animal kingdom exhibit
a higher order of instinct. A male, when in his prime,
about 6 or 7 years of age, will measure 6i to y\ feet in
length from the tip of his nose to the end of his little tail,
and will weigh from 400 to 600 pounds. Its muzzle and
jaws are about the same size and form as those of a full

way back, the little cows have a hard time of it at the
first and when they are few, for no sooner is one pretty
creature fairly established in the station of male number
one, who has got her there, than he perhaps sees another
of her style in the water from whence she has come, and
he devotes himself to coaxing the later arrival by the same
winning methods so successful before; whereupon bull
number two, one station in the rear, observing bull number
one to be off guard, reaches out with his long, strong
neck, picks up the passive cow by the scruff of her neck,
just as a cat does a kitten, and deposits her upon his
ground; and this will happen again and again until the
little cow will finally find herself several stations back.
Her last lord not being exposed to the same temptations
as lie on the water level, gives her such care that not
only could she not leave if she wished, but no other bull
gets a chance of seizing her. When the females have all
landed and the harems are full, it would seem that those
nearest the water may contain on an average from fifteen
to twenty females, those in the rear from five to twelve.
The courage of the fur seal is of the highest order. As

regards man, it is invariably of a defensive character.
Though always on the defensive, he never retreats, but he
will not attack ; the cows, however, are easily frightened
and are timorous. Shortly after the females are landed,
the young are born; they are for the first three months
of a jet black colour, are about fourteen inches long, and
weigh about four pounds. It would seem that they are
nursed only every second day, the mothers going off to
the fish grounds to get a supply of food, but they may
also return to suckle their young at night. When return-
ing in the daytime, each mother at once recognises her
own young, though there may be thousands upon
thouands all together blaating at once. Before entering
into such a crowd, the mother stops and calls out, just as
a sheep does for a lamp, and out of all the din she then
recognises her offspring's voice, and makes direct for it;
but it would seem that the young ones do not often know
their own mothers.
Early in August the young seals, now about six weeks
old, are taught to swim. If dropped into deep water
about this period down goes their bullet-like head, and
they are drowned; at first they try their skill in the shallow
pools, for a week or two they only flounder about, thrash-
ing the water as little dogs will do. When for the first
time they are well launched out they soon turn to the

shore, and if by some receding wave they should be left
high and dry, they will crawl away for a little distance
and, quite exhausted, will coil themselves up to take a
short recuperative nap, and then to the swimming lesson
again. Once boldly swimming they seem to fairly revel in it. The parents do not in the slightest degree supervise
or direct the young in swimming. The young shed their
black coat about the middle of October; the second or
sea-going jacket, does not at first vary in colour between
the sexes, nor does a pronounced difference take place
until after the third year. The females bear their first
young when they are three years old, and the period of
gestation lacks only a few days of a year.
The great herds of "bachelor" seals, numbering per-
haps one-third to one-half of the whole aggregate of the
5,000,000 seals known to the Pribylov group, are never
allowed under the pain of death to put their flippers on
or near the rookeries. These are the seals of most im-
portance to commerce, for with the exception of a few
thousand young ones and an odd old male, these are the
only ones slaughtered for their hides. They locate them
in immense tracts, mostly away from the rookeries, but

me that a few details, mainly constructive, might prove
of interest. It was suggested by Mr. Preece, in conse-
quence of a statement made by me in a paper on "Mea-
surement in the Medical Application of Electricity," read
before the Society of Telegraph Engineers. This state-
ment was to the effect that some difficulty still existed in
the trustworthy estimation of induction currents of
medium strength, such as are habitually used for physio-
logical and therapeutical purposes. The French Inter-
national Commission had only imperfectly remedied the
deficiency by recommending the universal adoption of a
particular pattern of induction coil made by a single
German firm, and arbitrarily graduated to a "sledge"
apparatus. Mr. Preece thought that a dynamometer,
which may be regarded as a galvanometer of which the
moving magnet is replaced by a suspended coil introduced
into the circuit, would answer the purpose; since the de-
flection of the coil is in one uniform direction, although
the currents traversing the circuit are alternate. This
very practical hint seemed to offer a prospect of obtaining
accuracy in a department of science in which it is much

needed. But on examining existing dynamometers I
found only Weber's original instrument, which, in spite
of its immense value, is fitted only for a well-appointed
laboratory, and another, made by Messrs. Siemens for
the measurement of very intense electric light currents,
which erred on the opposite side of deficient delicacy.
The dynamometer of Messrs. Siemens, shown at the
French International Exhibition, by means of which the
alternating currents of telephones were demonstrated,
was probably in the same category, though neither I, nor
the president of the Physical Society could obtain any
exact details of its internal arrangements.
An electrodynamic balance, described in the Annalen
der Physik in 1881 by Helmholtz, comes somewhat closer
to the requirements of the case, but this, like that of
Weber, is a delicate apparatus, difficult of transportation.
It might, however, prove excellent as a means of cali-
brating a less perfect and absolute, but more handy
instrument, such as that I was in search of.
Another form of dynamometer had been incidentally
named to me by Mr. Ayrton, of his invention, in which
the moving coil is replaced by a piece of soft iron which
becomes magnetic during the passage of the current. Of
this also further details were wanting.

fibres within a fixed coil, bringing its two ends to mercury
contacts at the lower part, and joining all up in one
circuit. Two defects at once appeared. 1. The coil of
copper wire was far too heavy to move with the small
currents at my disposal; and when it did swing, it con-
tinued to oscillate slowly for an unlimited time, giving no
satisfactory reading. 2. The mercury contacts caused so
much friction as absolutely to stop all motion whatever.
It was therefore obvious that (1) a light coil, and (2) a
sensitive bifilar suspension were needed. Both of these
must have a fairly high electrical conductivity. The
second of these desiderata may be dismissed first. I
found at the gold lace shops bobbins of silver-gilt wire, in
which the gold is drawn over the silver in manufacture;
not merely plated on. These two combined have a dia-
meter of jjff of an inch ; which is exactly that of the finest
platinum wire commercially made. But whereas the
resistance of 1 metre of the latter is bzz ohms, that of the
former is only 98 ohms. An induction shock from

KCENIG'S EXPERIMENTS IN ACOUSTICS
I.
T N the volume mentioned below1 Dr. Kccnighas collected
*¦ the valuable series of researches in expeiimental acous-
tics that have been published by him chiefly in the Annalen
of PoggendorfT and of Wiedemann during the past twenty
years. Many of these researches are well known in England,
having attained to "classic" importance, and their main
results are to be found embodied in all the best text-books
of acoustics. Other researches of more recent date are
yet known only to the few, but will doubtless win their
way to general knowledge before long. The most novel
points in the book are the late researches of its author
with the ingenious instrument known as the wave-siren.
This invention Dr. Koenig has applied to support his

views upon the origin of the beats of imperfect con-
sonances, and also to investigate the influence of differ-
ences of phase upon the quality of tones. The general
nature of the wave-siren has already been explained in
the pages of Nature, but in the sequel we will
attempt to describe fully its most recent forms, as
applied in the last investigation. In addition to these
deeply interesting matters of recent research, there is a
mine of wealth contained in the volume. The first
chapter deals with the application of the graphic method
in acoustics; an equally interesting chapter on mano-
metric flames and their applications occur a little further
on. Dr. Kcenig's researches on the standard tuning-fork
or "¦diapason normal" are too well known to need com-
ment. The reader will find the whole series of papers
collected in Chapter XIII. He will also find notices of an
adjustible tuning-fork capable of giving a variety of tones,
of a curious tuning-fork clock, of new stethoscopes, of

holtz's time, the theory had been propounded that quality
depended on the form of the vibrations of the wave of
sound; but since differences of phase greatly affect the
form of the vibration, Helmholtz was forced either to
abandon the new hypothesis that the ear thus decomposes
complex tones into simple ones, or else to establish by
experiment that no difference of phase affected the [per-
ception of quality by the ear.

The difference of form introduced into a complex
vibration by a difference of phase between its components
is already known; but Kcenig has brought forward tome
very striking examples. Fig. \a, for example, gives the
curves which result from compounding together the wave-
forms of a note and its first eight upper partials, each of
the nine tones being of equal intensity. Of the four
curves ranged in line the first corresponds to the result-

elements. It will also be observed that t^e curves for

difference of phase = \ is a reversed copy of that for
which the difference of phase = o; while the curves for
phase-difference \ and J are reversed copies of one an-
other. Now, according to Helmholtz's theory, all these
forms of vibration should yield identical sounds in the
ear. Koenig finds, on the contrary, the startling result
that the sounds are perceptibly different in quality. His
proof is extremely simple. The curve, calculated graphi-
cally with great care, is set off upon the circumference of
a cylindrical band of thin metal, the edge being then cut
away leaving the shaded portion, the curve being repeated
half a dozen times, and meeting itself after passing round
the circumference. For convenience the four curves to
be compared are set out upon separate rims of metal, all of which are mounted upon one axis to which a^P1"
motion of rotation can be imparted. Against the indented
edges of these rims wind can be blown through an appro-
priate slit; the whole combination forming a variety of
the Wave-Siren described a few months ago in the
columns of Nature (p. 358, vol. xxiv.). It will be

the slit the maximum condensation will result when the
slit is least covered, or when the point of greatest depres-
sion of the curve crosses the front of the slit. The
negative ordinates of the curves correspond therefore to
condensations, the positive ordinates to rarefactions.
Now, according to Kccnig's experiment, the sound is
louder and more forcible, with a difference of phase of \,
than in any other case, that with ^ difference being the
most gentle and soft in tone; whilst the curves of phase
o and i yield intermediate qualities of tone. Kcenig also
finds that by combining simply a note and its octave, the
loudest resultant sound occurs when the phase of com-
bination is \, a difference of phase of J again yielding
the feeblest resultant. In Fig. 1, 6, four curves are shown
corresponding to the combination of the odd members,
'» 3> 5i 7> 9> of the harmonic series, taken as before as of
equal intensity. In this case the form of the waves is
identical for the phases o and $ and also for the phases j
and j. The latter yield a loud" and strident tone as com-

pared with the former, though according to Helmholtz's
theory their tones should be alike. It may be objected to
these illustrations that in all natural sources of tone one
never finds a whole series of partial tones every member
of which is equally loud as the fundamental tone. It
is more nearly true for most musical instruments that
the higher up one goes in the series of partial tones
the feebler are they in comparison with the fundamental
tone.
Accordingly, Kcenig has combined, as in Fig. 2, a series
of partial tones corresponding to the respective frequencies
'i 3> 5> 7> 9> making the amplitude of each partial tone
inversely proportional to its frequency. The separate
curves are shown in Fig. 2, both grouped about a hori-
zontal line, and also as successively superposed upon the
fundamental. The uppermost of the set of curves ex-
hibits the final resultant; which, in this case, where the
difference of phase is taken as nil, and all the components
rise from zero together, is seen to consist of bold, well-
rounded sinuosities. In Fig. 3, curves identical in wave-
length and amplitude, but differing in phase by \, are
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:09 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
compounded together; but the final resultant shows a
wave-form that is practically a zig-zag. Now if these
bold sinuosities and zig-zags be cut out in thin metal and
curled up into circumferences so as to adapt them to use
as wave-sirens in the manner before-mentioned, it is
again found that the zig-zags corresponding to differences
of phase j and J yield always harsher and louder tones
than the rounded sinuosities that correspond to o and J.
These observations are very remarkable, and have im-
portant bearings that must be left for discussion in the
next article on Kcenig's work.
For the present we will conclude by observing that
more than once it has been pointed out that a certain
perception of difference of phase did exist. Sir W. Thomson has suggested that there is evidence of this in
the phenomenon of slow beats which by a curious
acoustic illusion almost always suggest the idea of some-
thing revolving. The writer of this notice had also pre-
viously pointed out that in certain cases where a compound
sound was led separately to the two ears a difference of
phase between the components could be detected.
It may not be generally known that Dr. Kcenig has
quite recently republished under the title of " Quelques Experiences d'Acoustique" the most important of his
recent researches, including those on the Wave-Siren
and on the Beats of Imperfect Consonances. The figures

THE RAINFALL OF THE GLOBE

¦*¦ this subject to the American Journal 0/ Science of
no small interest and value. The paper gives the mean
annual rainfall at 713 places in all parts of the globe, and
the results are graphically represented on a map of the

cism of meteorologists in furtherance of the work.

prominent are the low pressures which occupy the centres
of continents in the summer months, and the northern
portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in the winter
months ; and on the other hand, the high pressures which fill
the centres of the continents in the winter months, and the
high pressures in the oceans immediately to the west
sides of the great continents, about lat. 36 , as shown by
the Admiralty's physical charts of the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian Oceans.
To take, as an example, the great summer barometric
depression of Central Asia with the winds, flowing in upon
it on all sides vortically, carrying with them the moisture of
the ocean from which they come. Thus East Siberia is then
swept by south-east and east winds, which distribute to west-
ward as far as Irkutsk, in July, a monthly rainfall of 3 inches
and upwards. Now since the annual rainfall of this region
is all but wholly determined by the rains of the summer
months, the extension of these rains inland wholly deter-
mines the position of the annual iso-hyetal lines. Again,
to westward of long. 100° in Siberia, the rains have their
origin in the Atlantic and Arctic seas, and since west

and north-west winds prevail from Archangel to Central
Asia, they bring with them comparatively so large a share
of moisture from the ocean, as to raise the annual rainfall
over the greater part of these northern regions to about 20
inches, or even more. On the other hand, on the east
side of the Ural Mountains, which drain these winds of
mu:h of their moisture, the summer rainfall is much
less. From north of the Caspian and Aral Seas, south-
ward to the Persian Gulf, and eastward to the Indus,
the summer winds are north-west, and since they thus
advance over regions rapidly rising in temperature, little
if any moisture is deposited in their train, thus rendering
this extensive region one of the largest arid tracts of the
globe.
These, with other considerations, indicate that the
courses of several of the iso-hyetal lines, where observa-
tions are sparse, should be regulated to a greater extent
than has be?n done in the map before us, by the positions
of river-basin- and mountain ranges in their relations to
those seasonal winds, which really determine the annual
amounts of the r.iinfall.
One of the most important points to which attention is
drawn by Prof. Loomis, is that more rain falls on the
eastern than on the western sides of continents. This
remark holds good everywhere, until we reach the higher
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
latitudes of both hemispheres, where the predominating
winds become westerly. Thus the rainfall at San Fran-
cisco is only from a half to a th'rd of the amount which
falls on the coast of Pennsylvania in the same latitude;
and about the same proportions, or even proportions still
more striking, are seen on comparing Morocco with the
Chinese coast, and the west with the east coasts of South
Africa, Australia, and South America. The explanation
is to be found in the portions of the areas of low and high
pressures, with their accompanying winds, during the sea-
son whose rainfall determines the annual amounts. On the
east side of the continents the prevailing summer winds are
south-west, south, or south-east, which having traversed a
large extent of ocean, and constantly advancing into higher
and colder htitudes, spread a copious rainfall over the
regions they traverse. But on the other hand, since the
west side of continents in the same latitude lies between
the region of abnormally high pressure in the ocean
immediately to westward, and the low pressure of the
interior, north-west winds in the northern, and south-west
winds in the southern hemisphere prevail there; and as they

"La LAMPE soleil," or the sun lamp as it is called, from
the likeness of its rays to solar light, was successfully tried on
Saturday last in the vaults of the Koyal Exchange. This lamp
is the invention of MM. Clerc and Bureau of Brussels, and is so
simple in its action as to require no regulating mechanism. It
consists of a square block of marble or dry limestone, having
two holes pierced into it from above. The holes slant together
until they nearly meet just within the base of the block. Into
these holes are inserted the two carbon rods forming the poles
of the arc, and the current traversing the partition of calcareous
stone between their points heats it to incandescence, and thus a
soft white light is emitted from the bottom of the block. This
light is remarkably steady, and is very suitable for picture gal-
galleries. It was used to light the picture gallery in the recent

Paris Electrical Exhibition, and is now employed in the foyer of
the Grand Opera House, Paris. The limestone is calcined by
the current, and the carbons feed themselves by gravity as they
are consumed. The ugly shape of the lamp is certainly against
its use, unless it be sufficiently Well screened from view, but its
simplicity is decidedly in its favour.
The new Report (1880) of the Smithsonian Institution contains
among other valuable material, a Bibliography of Sir W.
Herschel's writings, a list of his published portraits, and a long
and very careful synopsis of his scientific writings. This last
occupies nearly too pages, and its value to the student is evident.
Appended there is a subject-index to the scientific writings of
Herschel. The same volume contains the first results of the
attempt of the Institute to issue a yearly report of the work
done at observatories all the world over; the report covers
upwards of 100 pages.
Of the Smithsonian Report, upwards of 200 pages are occu-

We have received a copy of an interesting address by Prof.
F. W. Hutton of Canterbury College, New Zealand, on " Biology
in an Arts Curriculum." The author takes as his subject the
principle of selection, ai.d after briefly explaining its importance
in biology, proceeds to argue that it is of not less importance in
psychology and sociology. The analogues, or rather parallels,
which he draws are thoughtful and interesting, as the following
examples will show :" Either from transmission, or from early

association, every man has a number of opinions common to the
nation and to the class in life to which he belongs, which may
be called his inherited opinions; but as his reasoning powers
develop, these opinions are subject to variation. The variations
may be owing to original ideas arising in his mind we know not
how, like the variations of structure in animals; or they may be
due to education, that is, to coming into contact with other
minds, either personally or through books; and it must be
noticed that, unlike structural variations, these mental variations
may be produced at any lime in a man's life, and may or may
not remain constant. Physical transmission is not necessary;
mental transmission from mind to mind diffuses a variation
rapidly through all the individuals, and con-equently it is not
necessary for the action of selection that the oriyinator of an
iii.proved mental variation should have any bodily offspring.
When mental variations compete with one another, selection
constantly acts on them through the agency either of utility or of
sympathy." Similarly in Sociology Prof. Hutton shows that
the principle of selection is all-important, and therefore that the
political constitution which best admits of variation within due
limits, or is most flexible, is most likely to survive in a struggle with
other political constitutions. Hence, be maintain?, the growing
tendency of Monarchies to supplant Despotisms, and of Republics
to supplant Monarchies; also of the progress of parliamentary
forms of governmentparliamentary discussion being but the

principle of selection applied to political ideas. The parallels
thus drawn between the principle of selection in biology and its
operation in psychology and sociology, are well presented; but
they are clearly in no way closely analogous to the survival of
the fittest among organisms. There is just such a resemblance
as there is in the case to which Prof. Hutton alludes of the
analogy between the biological and the social organism, and
which, as he truly observes, is incomplete and apt 10 be mis-
leading. "Indeed, it would not be difficult to find in this
analogy as many discrepancies as likenesses. What, for instance,
in the organisation of an animal answers to the professors of
theology, medicine, or law? What to prisons and reforma-
tories?" &c. So, we think, in the principle of selection,
although there is a general resemblance in its operation in
biology and in psychology or sociology, the resemblance is
nevertheless only general, and may au be pressed too far.
Thus, the single fact noticed by the author that variations of
ideas may propagate themselves without the aid of heredity, is
alone sufficient to constitute an immense difference between the
two classes of casesthe biological and the sociologicaland it
is further evident lhat iu biology there is uothing corresponding

OUR ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
Maskelyne's Value of the Solar Parallax.Mr.
Dunkin has consulted the first edition of Vince's " System of
Astronomy," published in 1797, and finds therein Maskelyne's
article on a new method of determining the solar parallax, the
same as in the second edition which appeared in 1814.
Mr. W. J. Davies, writing from Tyglyn, Cilian Aeron, Car-
digan, asks, with reference to this value of the parallax, Is it
not probable that this was first published in the Philosophical
Transactions? Prof. Ball, in his "Elements of Astronomy"
(Longman?, 18S0), pa^e 361, gives the value 8 '723, and the
authority for it, viz., Phil. Trans., vol. lxi. p. 574, year 1771.
O.i this point we may remark that Prof. Ball, according to the
statement in his preface, has mainly relied for his numerical
data upon Houzeau's "Repertoire des Constantes Astrono-
miques "a work which, though excellently designed, would,
according to our experience of it, benefit by a careful revision.
There are a number of errors in the first edition, which are

likely to be copied into more popular works, unless attention be
drawn to them. In the present case, where reference is made
for Maskelyne's parallax to the Phil. Trans., 1771, p. 574, we
find at that page a paper by Dr. Hornsby, entitled "The Quan-
tity of the Sun's Parallax as deduced from the Observation of
the Transit of Venus, on June 3, 1769, by Thomas Hornsby,
M.A., Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of
Oxford, and F.R.S.," in which the parallax from a number of
combinations is found to be 8" 78. Maskelyne's name is not
mentioned in the paper, which appears to relate exclusively to
Hornsby's own deductions.
Mr. Dunkin having traced the publication of Maskelyne's note
to 1797, the only earlier work of Vince in which it would be
likely to be found, is the fir-t edition of his text-book, the
"Elements of Astronomy," 1790. Mr. Davies remarks that
Olinthus Gregory, in his "Treatise on Astronomy," published
in 1803, refers to Maskelyne's method, and considered it the
best that had been given; he explains it almost in the same
words as in Vince, adding that the assumed value 8"83 was
taken "agreeably to the result of observations on the transit in
1761."

That there was an unlimited supply of energy in the interior of
the earth was a circumstance which had, he said, been over-
looked. In speaking of this energy, Mr. Milne first referred to
that portion of it which crops out upon the surface in countries
like Japan, Iceland, and New Zealand, in the form of hot
springs, solfataras, volcanoes, &c. He stated that there was an
unlimited supply of water in hot springs within a radius of one
hundred miles around Tokio, and that the heat of these springs
could be converted into an electric current, and the energy transmitted to the town. The second part of the paper referred to
the possibility of obtaining access to the heat which did not crop
out in the surface.
THE wholefbehaviour of homogeneous colours is explained
(according to Herr Albert, H}1ift!'. Ann., No. 5), on the Young-
Helmholtz theory, by this assumption: To a lessening of the
intensity of vari-coloured light correspond various lessening of
the strength of sensation, such that for rays of less wave-length,
to whatever part of the spectrum they belong, it decreases more
slowly than for rays of greater u ave-length.

ject to which much attention was given was the establishment of
polar meteorological stations. The station at Novaya Zemlya
has already been in operation, as is known, for two years, and a
new one, which will be established at the mouth of the Lena, is
provided with the best instruments, and is intrusted to persons
who will be able to make of it a first-class meteorological obser-
vatory. During the summer the expedition will reach the shores
of the Arctic Ocean, and begin the meteorological observations.
The Dutch station will be erected at Port Dickson, at the mouth
of the Yenkei.
Among the scientific expeditions undertaken by the Society, that
of M. Polakofi, to Sakhalin, promises to give very interesting results.
The rich ornithological collections made in the Alexandrovsk Val-
ley, on the western coast, proved that the birds of\Vestern Sakhalin
have a remarkable likeness with those of Siberia and Northern
Russia. The same is true with regard to the former inhabitants
of Sakhalin, whose stone implements and remains of earthenware,
discovered in great masses, are much like, or even identical to,
those of European Russia; the presence of obsidian implements,
however, originally front Kamschatlta, or from the islands of
the Pacific, hints that the inhabitants were in intercourse with
these countries. M. Polakkoff has also discovered dwellings of
the same period, which were holes, like those of the Kamtcha- dales, the numerous stone pieces which were used to be attached
to the nets, show that the nets of the prehistoric man were very
large, and that fishing was carried on to a great extent at that

he was rarely successful above if inches, having about 30,000
lines. These gratings were on speculum metal, and showed
more of the spect-nim than had ever before been seen, and have,

and in France and Germany, have sought to equal Mr. Ruther-
furd's gratings, but without success.
Under these circumstances, I have taken up the subject with
the resources at command in the physical laboratory of the Johns
Hopkins University.
One of the problems to be solved in making a machine is to
make a perfect screw, and this, mechanics of all countries have
sought to do for over a hundred years and have failed. On
thinking over the matter, I devised a plan whose details I shall
soon publish, by which I hope to make a practically perfect
screw, and so important did the problem seem, that I imme-
diately set Mr. Schneider, the instrument maker of the university,
at work at one. The operation seemed so successful, that I
immediately designed the remainder of the machine, and have
now had the pleasure since Christmas of trying it. The screw

is practically perfect, not by accident, but because of the new
process for making it, and I have not yet been able to detect an
error so great as i-ioo,oooth part of an inch at any part.
Neither has it any appreciable periodic error. By means of this
machine I have been able to make gratings with 43,000 lines to
the inch, and have made a ruled surface with 160,000 lines on
it, having about 29,000 lines to the inch. The capacity of the
machine is to rule a surface 61 X 4J inches, with any required
number of lines to the inch, the number only being limited by
the wear of the diamond. The machine can be set to almost
any number of lines to the inch, but I have not hitherto attempted
more than 43,000 lines to the inch. It ruled so perfectly at this
figure that I see no reason to doubt that at least two or three
times that number might be ruled in one inch, though it would
be useless for making gratings.
All gratings hitherto made have been ruled on flat surfaces.
Such gratings require a pair of telescopes for viewing the spec-
trum; these telescopes interfere with many experiments, absorb-
ing the extremities of the spectrum strongly ; besides, two tele-
scopes of sufficient size to use with 6-inch gratings would be
very expensive and clumsy affairs. In thinking over what would
happen were the grating ruled on a surface not flat, I thought
of a new method of attacking the problem, and soon found that
if the lines were ruled on a spherical surface, the spectrum
would be brought to a focus without any telescope. This dis-

covery of concave gratings is important for many physical inves-
tigations, such as the photographing of the spectrum both in the
ultra-violet and the ultra-red, the determination of the heating
effect of the different rays, and the determination of the relative
wave-lengths of the lines of the spectrum. Furthermore, it
reduces the spectroscope to its simplest proportions, so that
spectroscopes of the highest power may be made at a cost which
can place them in the hands of all observers. With one of my
new concave gratings I have been able to detect double lines in
the spectrum which were never before seen.
The laws of the concave grating are very beautiful, on account
of their simplicity, especially in the case where it will be used
most. Draw the radius of curvature of the mirror to the centre
of the mirror, and from its central point with a radius equal to
half the radius of curvature draw a circle; this circle thus passes
through the centre of curvature of the mirror, and touches the
mirror at its centre. Now if the source of light is anywhere in
this circle, the image of this source and the different orders of
the spectra are all brought to focus on this circle. The word
focus is hardly applicable to the case, however, for if the source
of light is a point, the light is not brought to a single point on

tion seems to be very fine, notwithstanding the short focus, and
divides the 1474 line with ease. But it is difficult to rule so
concave a grating, as the diamond marks differently on the
different parts of the plate.
These give illustrations of the results accomplished, but of
course many other experiments have been made. I have not yet
been able to decide whether the definition of ..he concave grating
fully comes up to that of a flat grating, but it evidently does so
very nearly.

attainable is doubtless far below that of the arc, but still it is
quite sufficient to maintain iron and aluminium in the state of
vapour, and show the reversal of the lines of these elements
with singular sharpness. The temperature of the interior is
sufficiently high to transform the diamond into coke, even in a
current of hydrogen, and the result may be taken as proving
that the temperature is above that of the oxyhydrogen flame.
The apparatus is thus constructed :A rod of carbon, 15
millims. in diameter, perforated down its axis with a cylindrical
hole 4 millims. in diameter, is passed through a hole in a lime
block, and is connected with the positive electrode of a Siemens'
dynamo electric machine ; another carbon rod, unperforated, is
passed into the lime block through a second hole at right angles
to the first, so that its end meets the middle of the other rod
inside the block of lime. The second rod is connected with the
negative electrode of the dynamo-machine, and after contact is
made between the two rods, is raised a little, so that the arc
discharge continues between the two carbon rods within the
block of lime. In this way, the outside of the perforated rod
or tube becomes intensely heated, the heat is retained by the
jacket of lime, and the interior of the tube gradually rises in

temperature, and attains in the central part a very high point.
By stopping the arc it can be made to pass through the same
stages of temperature in the inverse order. Observations are
made by looking down the perforation. When the light issuing
from the tube is projected by a lens on to the slit of a spectro-
scope, the heated walls of the tube give at top and bottom a
continuous spectrum, against which various metallic lines are seen
reversed, while in the central part, when the tube is open at the
f.irlher end, the spectrum is discontinuous, and the metallic lines
seen reversed against the walls at top and bottom, appear as
bright lines.
By passing a small rod of carbon into the perforation from
the further end, a luminous background can be obtained all
across the field, and then, as the walls of the tube are hotter than
the metallic vapours between them and the eye, the metallic
lines are only seen reversed. A very slight alteration in the
position of the carbon rod makes the lines disappear, or re-
appear, or show reversal, and as the core is adjusted by eye-
ob-ervation before photographs are taken, all the conditions of
the experiments are thoroughly known and are under easy control.
The authors have taken photographs of the violet and lower part
of the ultra-violet spectrum given by the tube at successive inter-
vals while the temperature was rising, and noted the following
results. When commercial carbons were used the first lines to

became conspicuous, then the manganese triplet about wave-
length 4034, and the calcium line, wave-length 4226, then the
calcium lines near M and an iron line, probably M, between
them, and then gradually a multitude of lines which seem to be
all the conspicuous iron lines between O and h. At this stage,
when the small rod is used to give a background, the bright
continuous spectrum is crossed by a multitude of sharp dark
lines, vividly recalling the general appearance of the solar spec-
trum. In the higher region the continuous spectrum extends
neyond the solar spectrum, and the magnesium line, wave-length
2852, is a diffuse dark band, while all the strong iron lines about
T, and the aluminium pair near S, are seen as dark lines. The
behaviour of the calcium lines H and K is peculiar. These lines
are often absent altogether, when the line wave-length 4226 and
the two near M are well seen, and when the two aluminium lines
between them and many of the iron lines are sharply reversed,
liven the introduction of a small quantity of metallic calcium or
calcium chloride into the tube did not bring them out reversed.
They were only seen as bright lines, not very strong, when the
! mall rod was removed.

W. Stow, M.A., F.M.S. This screen differs from the ordinary
Stevenson in the following respects :(1) It is somewhat larger.
(2) It has a single set of double zinc louvres. (3) It is partially
closed at the bottom to cut off radiation from the ground. The
advantages claimed for the use of zinc louvres are :(1) The
conductivity of metal causes the heat derived from the sun's
rays to be distributed over every part of the louvres. (2) The
louvres being much thinner than those of wood, the circulation
of air through the screen is not only much greater absolutely,
but much greater also in proportion to the bulk of the louvres.
(3) The zinc louvres, therefore, are much more sensitive to
changes of temperature than wooden ones. Comparative read-
ings of thermometers in this screen, along with those in an
ordinary Stevenson screen, were made during the summer of
1881. From these, the author is of opinion that the Stevenson
becomes unduly heated when the sun shines, but this may be as
much due to its small size as to the material of which the louvres
are made. The thermometers in it are only three to five inches

Berlin
Physiological Society, June 2.President, Prof, du Bois-
Reymond.Prof. Kronecker reported upon the experiments
which Dr. Melzer made to determine the action of the vagus
and superior laryngeal nerves upon respiration. The idea that
the action of the vagus in respiration has already been definitely
determined, proved to be unwarranted by the facts of the case.
It is known that stimulation of the nerve can both suspend in-
spiration and expiration; but the conditions of the opposed
effects are still to be investigated. Now the experiments of Dr.
Melzer have shown that these conditions are very manifold and
complicated. In a succession of cases, it is the strength of the
electric current that determines a particular effect; slight stimu-
lation of the vagus, producing a cessation of respiration in
inspiration, great stimulation producing the cessation in the
position of expiration, whereas stimulation of medium intensi-
ties produced cessation in an intermediate position. Further,
the condition in which the respiratory apparatus was at the
moment of stimulation of the vagus, determined the results of

the stimulation; the effect of an equal degree of stimulation
during inspiration being exactly the reverse of what it would
have been if applied during expiration. Simultaneous stimula-
tion of the vagus and the superior laryngeal had likewise very
diverse effects. If one nerve was more strongly stimulated than
the other, the effects of the more strongly stimulated nerve over-
came those of the other. If the stimulation in both was equally
strong, the results were cessation, either in the position of deep
expiration (this taking place when the vagus assisted the action
of the superior laryngeal), or in an intermediate position when
the two nerves acted antagonistically. Dr. Melzer has also had
opportunities of observing individual differences in the action of
the vagus, and supposes that the sex of the animal experimented
upon may have some influence. Since Hunter's time there have
been very few attempts to count the pillars in the electric organs
of the Torpedoes, and his view as to their number was universally
received as accurate. By the numerous careful countings of Prof.
Fritsch, on the contrary, it was discovered that the number of the
pillars only differed slightly in large and small specimens of the
same species, being often even greater in small specimens than in
large ones; embryos of Torpedoes were examined by him, and
these already exhibited the same number of pillars as are to be
met with in adult specimens of the same species. On the whole
the number of pillars in severab species of Torpedoes, which
are to be regarded as " good species," is pretty nearly the same.
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
It varies between 400 and 600; very large differences in the
number of the pillars are to be regarded as "species-characters,"
and are to be taken into consideration in diagnosis. And from
this point of view Hunter's results admitted of an explanation.
For Herr Fritsch had an opportunity of seeing two preserved
specimens of the American Torpedo occidentalis in Vienna.
These were, in spite of their shrinking in the spirit, one metre
long, and they turned out, when a calculation was made of the
number in their electrical organ, to have more than 1000 pillars;
it is hence probable that Hunter's giant electric rays were speci-
mens of Torpedo occidentalis that were washed upon the English
coasts by the Gulf-stream, and that Hunter's enumerations do
not in the least contradict the doctrine of preformation.

CLIFFORD'S MATHEMATICAL PAPERS

Mathematical Fragments; being Facsimiles of his Un-
finished Papers Relating to the Theory of Graphs. By the late W. K. Clifford. (London: Macmillan and Co., 1881.)

of modern English mathematical text-books, whose
duty compels them daily to read such literature, and who know
"The mi-pent tyme, the service vaine,
Whilk to considder is ane pane,"
can understand the pleasure of reviewing a book like
Clifford's Papers. Here there is no occasion to yawn
over page after page of commonplace, to mark with
wonder the hundredth iteration of an ill-founded infer-
ence, to trace with languid amusement the method and
arrangement of our ancestors, nay, the hereditary dots
and dashes decrepid in the fourth generation. On the
contrary, the novelty and variety alike of subject and of
treatment is almost confusing, every page shadows forth
some new idea, every line is informed with the personality
and with the genius of its author.
Clifford was one of the bright spirits, all too few in

number, who, in a generation, whose educational system
is devoted to the encouragement of mediocrity and the
cultivation of sciolism, saved the English school from the
reproach of inability to follow their leaders. He was one of
the select few who sat at the feet of Cayley and Sylvester,
and shared their genius. When we compare him with the
former of his great masters, he appears at first to want
the steadfast purpose and rugged strength of our mathe-
matical giant. The extreme, almost boyish vivacity of
his style, and the refined elegance and studied variety of
his methods give an impression of this kind which a
nearer acquaintance with his work speedily dispels.
Apart from his great originality, this elegance, popularity
in the best sense, of style gave Clifford a specially im-
portant place among the leaders of the English School of
Mathematicians, a place which there seems to be none
left to fill. It was by his assistance that many were led
to scale the almost inaccessible heights on which stand
the structures of modern mathematics.
In some respects the exuberant philosophy of his
popular works, especially his lectures, in which the more
striking conclusions of modern mathematical science
were presented to the uninitiated, must have harmed his
reputation for solidity of thought. We are also inclined
to doubt whether some of the enthusiastic non-mathe-

matical souls that thought they had assimilated his
teaching, really after all rose to the conception of
Riemann's finite space of uniform positive curvature, in
which the problem is solved of

Dass ihm sein Zopf so hinten hing,
Der wollt' es anders haben."
Such a flight is given only to the sons of Genius, and to

those who have in the first place painfully exercised their
pinions in less ambitious journeys. Still these lectures of
Clifford did good service in drawing the attention of the rising generation to the revolution that is taking place in
the very elements of exact science. If every physical
discovery of permanent or passing importance is to have
its day in the drawing-room and the lecture-hall, why
should the trumpet of mathematical progress not be
blown occasionally in the streets of Gath and Ascalon?
If too many be called in this way, some few may still be
chosen. To these few the volume of Mathematical Papers
will furnish the best help available in the English language
to enable them to follow their calling. To our mind the

from the elementary exposition of them given by Prof.
Smith in his introduction to the Papers, pp. xl. el seqq.
We should like, however, if we might venture to differ
from so great an authority, to take exception to his defini-
tion of flatness by means of the notion of planeness, and to
the introduction of the idea and the word curvature into
an elementary exposition of the properties of space. This
seems at best an explanation of the less by the more diffi-
cult; and, after all, the use in this case of the word curva-
ture is of questionable propriety (although sanctioned by
the highest authority), inasmuch as it suggests not only
true but also false analogies. It is very well in the hands
of a mathematician, to whom it suggests merely that a
certain common apparatus of mathematical formulae is
applicable to a particular class of manifoldness and to a
particular kind of surface; but to the mathematically
untrained or half-trained reader the word suggests the
paradox that portions of space on the two sides of a plane
in elliptic space both are and are not congruent. Much
harm has, we are persuaded, been done by this unfor-
tunate usage of words. A similar piece of mystery making

has been practised with «-dimensional space; the language
of mathematicians concerning which has been retailed to
ordinary simple-minded people as if it had the literal
sense they naturally attach to it.
Clifford's papers on the geometry of hyper-space began
with his translation of Riemann's famous Habilitations-
schrift on the hypotheses which lie at the basis of geo-
metry. He establishes a close connection between the
generalised geometry and the generalised algebra in the
Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions, to our mind one of
the ablest of his papers. He farther develops the subject
in the memoirs " On the Motion of a Solid in Elliptic
Space," "On the Theory of Screws in a Space of Con-
stant Positive Curvature," "On the Free Motion under
no forces of a Rigid System in an «-fold Homaloid."
The kinematic of elliptic space as given by Clifford, and
developed quite recently by Dr. Ball, forms one of the
most elegant and attractive of modern geometrical theories.
The starting point may be said to be the finding of the
analogue in elliptic space to Euclid's parallel. In the
modern geometrical sense a parallel {i.e. a line intersect-
ing another at an infinite distance) cannot of course
exist in elliptic space except as an imaginary line. If,
however, we define a parallel as the straight equidis-
tant from a given straight line, then through every
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
point in space two parallels (a right and a left parallel
as Clifford calls them) can be drawn to a given
straight line. This appears at once by drawing at the
given point a tangent plane to the equidistant surface of
the given straight line, which it will be remembered is,
in elliptic space, an anticlastic surface of revolution of the
second degree, every zone of which is congruent with
every other of the same breadth. This tangent plane
meets the surface in two rectilinear generators, which
intersect at the given point and have the property of equi-
distance from the given line. Parallels in this sense are
of course imaginary in hyperbolic space, Euclid's parallel
being the transition case for parallels in both senses. It
seems a pity that a new word has not been used for this
species of parallel.
It follows at once by synthetic reasoning of the simplest
kind (in which we may in fact dispense with the aid of
biquaternions or analytical aid of any kind) that almost
all the properties of Euclidian parallels and parallelo-
grams have their counterpart in the theory of Clifford's
parallels, due attention being paid to the distinction of

for the most highly educated reader. The charming sim-
plicity of their style, the omission of everything like
superfluous detail, and the great variety and importance
of the subjects treated, will make the book an indispen-
sable vade mecum for the tyro in pure mathematics. We
think with regret of the infinite use it would have been to
us in our learning years; from it we could have gathered,
easily and pleasantly, in the pliant hours of youthful
leisure, what we are now constrained to glean, in the
intervals of ordinary drudgery, from partial treatises, and
articles in foreign periodicals often the driest of the dry.
We must not conclude this notice without alluding lo
the appendix to the volume of papers, the most important
parts of which are the fragment of a treatise called " The
Algebraic Introduction to Elliptic Functions," the Notes
of Clifford's Mathematical Lectures, and the problems
and solutions contributed to the Educational Times.
The fragment on elliptic functions, which deals with the
Theta functions, has great value, as it gives a treatment
of the subject not to be found in any English text-book.

mathematics as are sufficiently alive to the need of some
modification of our traditional methods to take advantage
of them. They remind us of the irreparable loss we have
sustained by Clifford's early death of a doughty champion
in the reformation of our degenerate system of mathe-
matical education, which strangles the youthful mathe-
matician ere he is born. It is, perhaps, too much to
expect that the veteran chiefs of mathematical science
should enter into the work of the drill-sergeant of mathe-
matical recruits. They cannot be asked to devote their
time to the petty work of reorganising the teaching of
geometry and algebra in our schools and colleges. The
more reason that we should mourn the departure of one
who was able to take his place with the gods immortal,
and yet disdained not to mingle with us mortals in the
dusty fray of the Trojan Plain.
The handsome folio of lithographed manuscripts re-
lating to the Theory of Graphs, forms one more monu-
ment of Clifford's genius, and affords us one more reason
to lament our loss. Fully as we appreciate what he has
actually done for us, and much as we are grateful for it,
we cordially sympathise with the feeling that prompted
the editor of the papers to put on the title-page the saying
of Newton concerning Cotes: "If he had lived, wc might

The Rainfall of the Globe
In reference to a paragraph in an article on the rainfall of the
globe in Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 206, Prof. Loomis states that
the heaviest rainfall is met with in the rain belt, which surrounds
nearly the whole globe lying between the north-east and south-
east trade-winds.
Having been engaged in collecting records of rainfall at sea
for some time back, 1 may take the opportunity of saying that I
have received data enough to enable me to give an estimation of
rates per annum for this rain-belt.
That for the Atlantic Ocean is calculated at I33'37 inches
per annum, that for the Indian Ocean at 8o'5S inches per annum,
that for the Austro-Chinese Seas at 107'96 inches; but none has
yet been made out for the Pacific Ocean, owing to absence of
observation altogether from that quarter.
In physical atlases the rain-belt is continued across this ocean
in the same latitudes as it is found to exist in the Atlanic and
Indian Oceans, but as yet it is only conjectural, and it may prob-

ably be found to cross in other spaces by direct observations
taken at sea. The observance of rainfall on islands in the open
oceans would appear to afford but imperfect means of judging of
the rainfall at sea surrounding them. It is frequently found that
they differ very materially, as at St. Helena, the island may be
covered with mists, invisible, while the ship outside is sailing
under a clear sky and fresh breeze.
The ocean rainfall, therefore, can only be made out by obser-
vations on board ships, and these are not easy to get, and also
take up a long time in effecting. W. ]. Black

The Recent Unseasonable Weather
Mr. Archibald's letter on this subject displays great ability,
and is deserving of much attention by meteorologists. Nothing
can be, I think, more interesting and important than a proper
interpretation of the meaning of the facts of the weather of the
late extraordinary and contrasted seasons. Will you, therefore,
allow me shortly to make a few remarks regarding the com-
parison pointed out by Mr. Archibald as existing between the
weather of India and that of North Europe.
In the "Report on the Meteorology of India," 1877, the
reporter, referring to the Himalayan regions, says: "There are
two periods of cold, (1) when the snow is accumulating; and (2)
when it is dissolving; and the first occurs in January and Feb-
ruary, the latter in April and May." Again, he says: "The
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
conclusion appears to be very strong that during the early months
of the year, one very important factor in determining the pe-
culiar features of the season is, the amount of snowfall and of
snow accumulation in the Himalayan regions during the winter."
For six years past I have observed the same thing hold gene-
rally in the north of Europe, a cold w inter being followed by a
late spring and an ungenial summer, and vice versa. This I
would therefore be inclined to regard as a general law. The
weather of June, however, serves to indicate the difference between the meteorological conditions of India and North Europe.
It has been ungenial, I think, solely, on account of the excep-
tional force and warmth of the winds of winter causing a vast
detachment of the ice in the polar regions. This ice has floated
into lower latitudeshas come much nearer to usand has produced, in melting, icy winds. These commingling with the
warmer tropical winds, have produced in their turn the recent
changeable weather.
Our cold spring winds usually come from the east of north,
but the prolongation of cold winds which we experienced in the
middle of June, came from the we>t of north, indicating their
origin to be in the masses of ice floating for the most part
probably between Iceland and the American coast. Thus the
movable ice has caused a high atmospheric pressure and a low

067? ASTRONOMICAL COLUMN
The Transit of Venus in New South Wales, &c.In
his address as president of the Royal Society of New South
Wales, read May 3, Mr. H. C. Russell, the director of the
Observatory at Sydney, gave some account of his arrangements
for the observation of the approaching transit of Venus in that
colony. Provision was liberally made last year by the legis-
lature, and a sum of 500/. has been placed at Mr. Russell's dis-
posal for this purpose. Wilh this he states he will be able to
provide four high-class 6-inch equatorials, exactly similar to
those which are to be used by European observers, and two of
4J inches. There are remaining from the last transit one equa-
torial of IIj inches, one of 7J, one .of 5 inches, one of 43, and
one of 4\ inches. He hopes to be able to take up four stations, in addition to the Observatory, with two observers and two tele-
scopes at each point. In order to make the best of the chances
of favourable atmospheric conditions, elevated points on the east
coast of New South Wales, have been selected, which, it may
be fairly anticipated, will have a clearer view an hour after sun-
rise than could be looked for near the sea-level. Mr. Russell
remarks that in observing the transit of Mercury last November,
the observers were stationed at Bathursf, Katoomba, and

Sydney, places which he had thought were far enough apart to
secure different weather ; but the result showed that the weather
was practically the same at the three stations. This induced the
unpleasant reflection that it may prove cloudy all along the coast
on December 6, and he had therefore gladly taken advantage of
the recent commission to Lord Howe Island to make some
inquiry as to its suitability as a station. It is found that an
elevated spot is easy of access, and the weather at the hour and
season is almost sure to be fine.
We have also received from the Imperial Observatory of Rio
de Janeiro a report on the proposed arrangements to be made by
the Brazilian Government for securing observations of the
Transit. In addition to Rio, it is intended to establish a station
at Pernambuco and to equip an expedition to Santiago de Cuba.
The details are in charge of M. Cruls, acting director of the
Observatory at R io.
Solar Parallax from Observations of Minor Planets.
Mr. David Gill, H.M. Astronomer at the Royal Observatory,
Cape of Good Hope, has arranged with a number of observa-
tories in both hemispheres for corresponding observations of the
minor planets, Victoria and Sappho, about the times of their
oppositions in the present year. Victoria, in opposition on
August 24, will be distant from the earth o'Sg of the earth's
mean distance from the sun; and Sappho, which comes into
opposition in R.A. on September 24, will be within C85, so

that we have in each case a favourable opportunity of applying
the method of determining the sun's parallax, which was advo-
cated and also applied by Prof. Galle, the director of the Obser-
vatory at Breslau. In a communication to the Astrommische
Nachrichten, Mr. Gill states that the necessary extra-meridian
observations will be made in the southern hemisphere at the
Cape, Natal, Melbourne, and Rio de Janeiro, and in the
northern hemisphere at Dunsink (Dublin), Strasburg, Berlin,
Bothkamp, Leipsic, Upsala, Moscow, Clinton, U.S., and pro-
bably at Kiel. From the clearer skies of the southern hemi-
sphere, he believes that a fully corresponding number of obser-
vations will be secured there, notwithstanding the smaller num-
ber of observatories, and he invites co-operation from other
establishments in the northern hemisphere, on this ground. A
list of the proposed stars of comparison is given in his
letter.

in nothing is it more true than in the case of education
that what is well begun is half done. Hence a good infant
school is an immense help to all subsequent stages, and
vLeversd. So much is this deterioration felt in Michi-
gan, where salaries ot schoolmistresses have been reduced
to the level of those of domestic servants, that the attend-
ance at the primary schools has absolutely fallen off; and
the explanation of it seems to be that these faults are well
known to the intelligent public of the United States, and
accordingly the children are being removed to private
schools. The Commissioner very aptly quotes Roger
Ascham's words:
"It is a pity that commonly more care is had, yea, and
that among very wise men, to find out rather a cunning
man for their horse1, than a cunning man for their
children. . . . To one they will gladly give a stipend of
200 crowns by the year, and loath to offer to the other

choice to scorn, and rewardeth their liberality as it should.

horses, but wild and unfortunate children; and therefore,
in the end, they find more pleasure in their horse than
comfort in their children."
This is not a bright picture of the work of education in
America. It certainly seems an indication that our
brethren there are losing faith in the old rule, that what is
worth doing at all is worth doing well, but it does not
go very deep below the surface of so vast a work. On the
whole there continues a steady rise in numbers of both
schools and pupils, though not so large since 1875, as we
should have expected in such a progressive country.
This rise also is almost wholly in cities, again pointing
to the difficulty of supplying the number of schools
required in so wide-spread a country. In one of the most
flourishing of these cities also, Chicago, it sounds more
like the Old World to read that more than 2000 children are
taught in underground rooms, where the light is so bad
as to expose their eyes to serious injury! In New York
and New Jersey, where population in its extremes of rich
and poor keeps crowding together as in older countries,
the school attendance is actually falling off. In Maine,
New Hampshire, and Rhode Island the population is,
curiously enough, at the present time decreasing, but
school attendance is increasing ; not quite one-third of the
population attend daily; nearly two-thirds are on the

books. In nearly all Southern States there is consider-
ably increased attendance. The administration of the
Peabody Fund has had a remarkable influence in deve-
loping the school spirit in the south, in awakening the
people to a sense of their obligation with reference to the
support of public schools and in maintaining a high
standard for such schools. This last result has been
accomplished by the wise policy pursued by Dr. Sears in
insisting upon a certain degree of excellence in a school
as the condition of receiving aid from the fund.
An increase of more than 50 per cent, in the number of
students in the Schools of Science in 1878 led to the
number of these schools being raised from 809 to 884;
but this increase of pupils hardly kept up in 1879. Still
science, though a long way behind theology in number of
schools, is rapidly gaining ground upon it, and has already
far outstripped it in number of students. In 1870 there
were 80 schools of theology with 3254 pupils, which
numbers have grown respectively to 133 and 4738; but
the corresponding numbers for science are 17, increasing
to 81, and 1413, increasing to 10,914! This has called

Evening High Schools have been worked in several Ame-
rican cities,but hardly with results lendingmuch encourage-
ment to increase. One would think, however, that the know-
ledge gained at elementary schools by the age of fourteen
would lead to a wish for more on the part of many, to whom
a library only could not supply it. But free libraries are a
great power in the United States. Forty-nine new ones
were opened in 1879, containing 86,779 volumes, making
a total of 3842 public libraries of all classes. The cor-
respondence with the Bureau of Education on the subject
of public libraries far exceeds that on any other sub-
ject; academies standing next, and art and science
standing curiously low for a country like America. Yet
local feeling varies even on a favourite subject like free
libraries, the large manufacturing town of Paterson being
without one like so many populous English towns.

""PHE learned authors have earned the thanks of lin-

important contribution to a better knowledge of the
Melanesian and Papuan languages, which was first pub-
lished in the eighth volume of the Philological Transac-
tions of the Royal Saxon Scientific Institute. It forms
the first instalment of a series of papers intended to
supplement the comprehensive and well-known treatise
of H. C. von der Gabelentz, published at Leipzig in i860
and 1873. To the languages dealt with in that work are
now added two others: that of Mafdr (Niifdr), Geelvinck

Bay, and a dialect current on the Astrolabe Bay Coast,
North-East New Guinea, from materials supplied by Van
Hasselt and Miklucho-Maclay respectively. To these
notices are added the Papuan idioms spoken in the
islands of Errub and Maer, Torres Strait, and in Segaar
Bay, near Cluer Gulf, South-West Coast of New Guinea,
the former by Herr Grube, the latter from data supplied
by H. Strausch to the Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie, viiL,
pp. 405-18.
In the introduction, the question of the relations of the
Papuan and Malayo-Polynesian linguistic groups is dis-
cussed at some length. It is satisfactory to find that the
authors seem at last disposed entirely to abandon the
views held by the elder von der Gabelentz regarding a
possible, if not probable, fundamental unity of these
families. The key-note of the objection to this theory is
struck in the following paragraph, at p. 4 :"Assuming
that the linguistic affinity were fully established, we should
have at once a direct antagonism between anthropology
and philology. Two linguistic groups are related; of the
corresponding ethnical groups, one belongs to one, the

have always been the aggressors, where the dark popula-
tions have always represented the passive or recipient
element. On the other hand, wherever it has escaped
from Malayo-Polynesian influences, or wherever it has
been able to preserve its original speech in spite of those
influences, this dark element will certainly be found
speaking languages organically distinct from the Malayo-
Polynesian. Mr. Man's recently published account of
the Andamanese dialects shows that they differ in their
morphology, in their glottologyin fact, in every respect,
from those of Malaysia.
Mr. Lawes makes the same remark respecting the
Koiari people, who occupy the highlands back of
Moresby Bay in South-East New Guinea. And the
authors of the work under review now find that the Mafor
of Geelvinck Bay betrays, with many striking resemblances
to the Malayo-Polynesian, "an astounding peculiarity of
structure."1 The " resemblances" are of a verbal cha-
racter, due to known contact with the Malays, who have
long frequented the waters along the north-west coast of
New Guinea. The "peculiarity of structure," involving

inflection ("Quasiflexion "), as understood in the Aryan
family, belongs to the organic Papuan linguistic type.
This type is thus demonstrated to be fundamentally dis-
tinct from the Malayo-Polynesian, which shows no trace
of these peculiarities. And thus also disappears the
fancied antagonism hitherto supposed to exist between
the linguistic and anthropological elements in the Oceanic
regions. A. H. Keane
THE SOLAR-COMMERCIAL CYCLE
IN an article printed in Nature (vol. xix., pp. 588-90)
I gave a table of the prices of wheat at Delhi, from
1763 to 1835, quoted, or rather calculated from data given
in a brief paper of the Rev. Robert Everest, contained in
the Journal of the (London) Statistical Society for 1843,
vol. vi. pp. 246-8. Between the years 1763 and 1803 there
was evidence of wonderful periodicity in the recurrent
famine and abundance at that part of India. When
recently engaged in examining more minutely the relation
between these prices and the variations of solar activity,
as indicated by Prof. Wolfs numbers, it has occurred to
me that an inference may be drawn which I overlooked
on the previous occasion.
In the accompanying diagram I have exhibited the
prices in question together with Wolf's numbers as stated

PP- 77i 78- I have also indicated the dates of the Com-
mercial Crises of the time according to the article on the
subject in Mr. H. D. Macleod's " Dictionary of Political
Economy," vol. i. pp. 627-8. It need hardly be said that
the coincidence between the three classes of recurrent
phenomena is of a very remarkable character, and goes
far in supporting the relation of cause and effect which I
had inferred to exist, both on empirical grounds and from the well-known fact that it is the cheapness of food in
India, which to a great extent governs the export trade
from England to India. But although the coincidence of
commercial Crises in Western Europe with high corn
prices at Delhi is almost perfect, it will be noticed that
after 1790, the correspondence of the solar curve with
that of prices is broken. Wolf does not recognise the
existence of any sun-spot maximum between 1788 and
1804, and he believes that there was a minimum at 1798.
According to Wolf's later researches {Memoirs Roy. Ast.
Soc, vol. xliii. p. 302), these dates are respectively, maxi-
mum 1788-1, minimum 1798-3, and maximum, 1804-2.

named except 1880. The average liability of each failure
in 1873 was $44,274 compared with [22,369 in 1878. It is
thus apparent that the crises differed entirely in character,

of failures in 1878, succeeded by a sudden reduction, and
it occurred at a time differing by less than a year from
the corresponding collapse in England. In the Dominion
of Canada there was a very strongly marked maximum of
failures at the same time as in England, namely, in 1879.
The theory of the solar-commercial cycle and of the
partially oriental origin of decennial crises has received
such confirmation as time yet admits of. I am, however,
fully alive to the weight of some of the difficulties and
objections which have been brought forward against the
theory. These objections are far from being conclusive,
and I may hope to give them in due time a satisfactory
answer. But such answer must involve more detail than
can be put into a brief article.

CONVENTIONAL REPRESENTA TION OF THE

bridge, and why the critical public have so long acquiesced
in these incorrect representations without remonstrance.
Partly, no doubt, it is owing to prevalent errors of con-
ception which govern the judgment in its interpretation of
a movement that is hard to follow. An excellent instance
of this is to be seen in the Academy, in the diploma
picture of Mr. Riviere, R A., entitled "The King drinks."
It is a lion lapping water in the wrong way, by spooning
his tongue outwards and upwards instead of curling it
backwards, like the fingers of the half-closed hand when
the knuckles are to the front, an action that may be con-
veniently studied in the kitten. The error of preconceived
ideas partly explains the conventionally extended figure
of the galloping horse ; but I find the latter to be largely
justified by the shape of the blur made on the eye by his
rapid and various movements. I wish I could reproduce
on a scale, however small, any one of the many plates
published in "The Horse in Motion;" but it appears
that the copyright of the photographs is disputed, and
there are difficulties in the way of doing so, and I must
make shift without them.
I find that taking the attitudes of the galloping horse,

book just mentioned, that her stride has the duration of

composites of each of these groups, and copies of them

A contains six attitudes, in which the legs are crumpled
below the body.
B contains four attitudes, in wh:ch one or both of the
hind legs are on the ground, and the fore legs are pawing
in the air.
C contains five attitudes, in which both the fore and
hind legs are extended.
D also contains five attitudes; the hind legs are flung
back and the fore legs are on the ground.
G is the general composite of all the attitudes.
It will be observed that in the general composite the
blur somewhat justifies the conventional representation,
because though the lower parts of the limbs leave ho
definite iirage at all (less so in the photograph than in
the engraving), the upper portions have a distinctly
outflung look, and as the artist lies under the same

I find, however, on trial that another cause of confusion
lies in the difficulty of watching closely both the fore and
the hind halves of the animal simultaneously. The eye
wanders from one to the other and seizes the most cha-

THE CHANNEL TUNNEL
T the meeting of the Paris Academy of June 26, M.
Daubrdc read a note on the geological conditions of
the Channel tunnel. The works connected with the
tunnel comprise three phases :(1) Scientific researches;
(2) preparatory works; (3) execution of the tunnel itself.
The first phase was devoted to purely geological investi-
gation, in the form of minute exploration of the French
and English coasts, exact and detailed investigation of
the sea-bottom in the Strait, borings made on terra
Jirma which verified the nature, thickness, and inclination
of the strata, and gave an approximate idea of the hydro-
logical condition. Since 1879 the second phase has been
entered on by verifying the previous scientific data, and
preparing for the execution of the tunnel itself, experi-
menting in small galleries with machines and tools capable
of being ultimately u<ed in a work of exceptional import-
ance. On the French coast, the geological investigation
established a slight bulging of the beds at the place
known as the Quenocs. On account of this bulging the
inclination of the strata, which, in the strait is towards the
north-north-east, is found, along the cliffs of Blanc Nez,
turned towards the south-east, and the slope which,
according to the first orientation, in the neighbourhood

of the Quenocs, is about o-oj m. per metre, is found, in
the second, to be nearly o'og m. It is important then, to
find in what conditions this bulging may modify the
physical conditions of the banks forming the base of the
Rouen chalk. For this purpose the French Association
had dug, near Sangatte, two shafts of a depth of 86 m.,
which met the gault at 59 m. below the hydrographic
zero, adopted in the maps in which the geological explo-
rations of 1875-6 are recorded. The digging of these
shafts, one of them 540 m. in diameter, showed that all
the white chalk and the upper part of the Rouen chalk
are water-bearing. These strata had thus to be aban-
doned.
On the other hand, the base of the Rouen chalk allowed
only a very small portion of water to pass. There, then,
the tunnel should be pierced, as the stratum appeared to
proceed without interruption from France to England.
The water penetrating the works is fresh, and of good
quality; at the upper part only some slightly salt veins
were found. Nevertheless, the communication of the
water-bearing strata with the sea is proved by the oscilla-

entirely successful in producing a fine effect. There are about
250 lamps displacing 8000 wax candles, and they are fed by the
current from six Gramme machines of B type. The field

From the Cape of Good Hope we receive the Report for
1881 of the South African Museum, which, under the superin-
tendence of Mr. Trimen, is prospering and increasing. The
following paragraph is of some interest:" Upon trustworthy
information that in a part of the Beaufort West district some
unusually fine and perfect remains of extinct Saurians were
accessible, the Trustees in October last despatched the Acting
Curator to make an examination on the spot. Mr. Oakley
reported that he had met with a large quantity of fragmentary
regains of the DieynoJon group (some of which he brought with
him), and that he had reason to believe, from the best local
information obtainable, that in the bed of the Klein Leeuw River
there existed an almost perfect fossil skeleton of a Saurian of
great size, which, though recently visible, had become hidden by
alluvial deposits. In transmitting this report to Government on
November I, the Trustees s'rongly recommended that a sum of
200/. should be placed on the estimates for 1S82-83, for
the purpose of defraying the cost of procuring for the Museum
the more perfect of these fossil remains, and of conducting
further investigations into South African paleontology ; and they
were informed in reply that every consideration would be given

to their proposal when the time for framing the estimates should
arrive. In reference to their subsequent communication on the
subject, dated February 9, they now desire respectfully to renew
their recommendation, as it is most desirable that the extinct
Duynodontia and allied reptilian forms, so characteristic of the
past life of South Africa, should be as completely represented as
possible in the Colonial Museum." We trust the necessary
funds have been granted, and that the_Trustees will see that it is
for the best interests of the Colony that such an institution as
this be maintained in complete efficiency.
The surveyor to the Finnish Government, Herr Rodas, states
that on June 25 this year he carefully measured the height of a
hole, bored according to authentic records 2 inche above the
level of the sea on the coast of Osterbotten on June 25, 1755,
and discovered that that part of the coast had risen, in 127 years,
6 feet 4 inches, or more than half an inch per year.
A second earthquake of a far more violent character than the
previous one, was felt at the town of Lulea in Sweden on June 23
at 7-3° a'm-i the shock extending as far as the towns of Hapa- randa and Pitia. It lasted fully a minute, and went from south-
west to north-east. People awoke from their sleep, and those
about could only stand with difficulty, and that no accident oc-
curred is due to the circumstance that all houses are constructed
of wood. Whilst the tremor lasted subterranean noises could be
heard similar to the rapid movement of heavy artillery on a hard
road. There was no disturbance of the sea, the weather was

June 28. The museum has been temporarily located in Uni-

It was unanimously resolved that an appeal for subscriptions

over 100 influential members of the medical profession had
expressed their desire to contribute to the fund. Mr. Spencer Wells was appointed treasurer, Mr. Arthur Myers, surgeon to

Conclusions as to this path have been drawn from structure, but
Dr. Paulsen adopted the method of lining the nasal cavity in the
head of a dead body with small pieces of red litmus paper, and
then causing ammoniacal air to be inhaled and exhaled through
the windpipe. The changes of colour in the paper proved that
the expiratory and inspiratory currents take nearly the same

nasal passages, but along the septum in an arching course, convex
above. The course of air-currents was investigated under vary-
ing conditions of ventilation, &c, also the behaviour of secondary
cavities. Some old and new experiments on the act of smelling
are explained on the basis of the facts elicited.
From the woody tissue of some plants (according to recent re-
searches by Herr Max Singer, Vienna) four substances can be
extracted by means of hot water: I. Vanillin, which seems to
be one of the most widely distributed plant-substances; it is found even in decayed wood and in brown coal. 2. A substance
which shows the reactions of coniferin. 3. A species of gum
soluble in water. 4. A substance soluble in water, and coloured
yellow with muriatic acid, not identical with any of those already
specified. Moreover, woody tissues (also elder pith) contain the
wood gum discovered by Thomson. In what relation these
substances stand to the hypothetical lignine is not determined,
but the way in which they can be separated from the wood, one
after another, by water, renders it probable that what is called
lignine is a mixture of several chemical entities.

system of paying on results, which has had so large a develop-
ment since in various directions, was first tried here. This is
not, however, the occasion for discussing the general system of
science instruction, and science payments, and I only advert to
it at the present moment to call attention to what has grown out
of it to supplement it, and that is the arrangement for bringing
science teachers from the country up to London for short courses
of instruction in the summer. That is a system which 1 believe
obtains in no other place or country; I believe it is most in-

that the Normal School of Science is not the outcome of some
cut and dry report of a commission, founded possibly on a foreign
example, but it is the natural outgrowth of what has teen found
to be required. It has grown so as to suit its environment, and
so far is a thoroughly English institution; and now that it has in
the fulness of timeI will not say that the time may not have
been a little too fullnow that it has come out in its full plumage,
I think the country may be congratulated on this. It has a
.cienlific educational institution fairly provided with apparatus
and appliances; but it has what is far more valuable. It has a
staff of professors whose position in the scientific world for the

work they have done, whose power of teaching and imparting
knowledge, and whose zeal in the cause will, I believe, bear com-
parison with the staff of any other similar institution, or seat of
learning in this or any other country at the present time.
The Chairman:I have now the pleasure of calling on Prof.
Huxley, the Dean of our re-organised institution.
Prof. Hux'ey :Mr. Mundella, under ordinary circumstances
the address the Dean of the School is called upon to make on
occasions of this kind is confined to a statement of the condition
of the school, and to an account of the manner in which the
various departments of instruction are thriving or otherwise.
Hut as this institution, the Normal School of Science and
Koyal School of Mines, is extremely youngin fact has not yet
completed the first year of its existence1 think, with your per-
mission, it may be well that I should call the attention of those
who have honoured us by their presence to facts with which your
official mind is perfectly familiar, but of which they cannot be
expected to have cognisance.
As Col. Donnelly has just remarked, this institution has not
been so much made as it has grown; it is therefore a parti-
cularly English institution, inasmuch as in that respect it re-
sembles the British constitution, which, from an abstract and
logical point of view is probably not the most symmetrical and
reasonable fabric that ever was raised, but which has the great
merit of having grown out of the actual conditions of life, and of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
possessing the power of adapting itself to the incessant changes
of our social state. The school is not, as might be judged
from its title, a dual institution like the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy; but it has grown out of the growth, development,
and eventual coalescence of two perfectly distinct and indepen-
dent organisations, which have at different time-, and quite
independently of one another been set on foot by the Govern-
ment of this country for the purpose of giving scienceby which
I mean physical sciencethat influence upon the industries and
arts of the country which, as every one now recognises, is abso-
lutely essential to their sound and rapid progress. The Royal
School of Mines was practically established, or rather the foun-
dations of it were laid, so far back as the year 1851, at which
time a very staunch and kind friend of mine, at a time when
friends were not quite so plentiful as they are now, the late Sir
Henry De la Beche, one of the most sagacious and able men it
was ever my good fortune to meet with, having set agoing,
chiefly by his own energy, the Geological Survey of Great
Britain, obtained the attachment to that service, und to the

institution, lecturing about natural history, and I am sorry to
say, all the time, with the more or less definite consciousness,
that I was an involuntary impostor, and that it was not possible
for me to teach in any genuine fashion, because I had no
room in which practical instruction could be given. I do not
know whether my colleagues would be inclined to make the
same confession, but the same want must have been felt in the
teaching of physics, and in the other kinds of instruction given
in the school. Moreover, we had no mathematical instruc-
tion, and, in spite of our repeated representations, it was not
provided.
Now that state of things obtained up to the year 1872. By
that time some of us had got extremely tired of it, and I was
one of those who were so tired, my chemical colleague was
another, 'my colleague the Professor of Physics was a third,
and we got up a sort of little pronunciamento to say that we
really could not go on teaching in that way any longer; that
at South Kensington there was a large building which was
standing perfectly empty, and might we be allowed to do our
business in a more efficient way by being transferred to this
empty building? With the assent and consent of our colleagues,

and with the sanction of the Department of Science and Art,
the desired transference took place, and the result of that was,
that all the professors who were moved were able at once to
institute a more or less adequate system of practical instruc-
tion, and to make the teaching in the school in their own depart-
ments something like what it ought to be. Subsequently the
Professors of Geology and Metallurgy and Applied Mechanics
were similarly moved, until now only the Professor of Mining
remains in Jermyn Street, simply because he has there the admir-
able collection of models which are so important for his work.
That, Sir, is the historyso far as it can be told, in a few words,
of the origin and growth of the Royal School of Mines. The
only change that has taken place in consequence of the new
organisation in that institution is that it has been made more
efficient. Mathematical instruction has been added; practical
teaching has been supplied in all branches of science which
the Associates of the Royal School of Mines are required to
study, and I cannot doubt, seeing the respect which has for
many years been paid to the title of Associate of the Royal
School of Mines, that that respect will simply grow and increase
with the knowledge of the public, that the only alteration which
has taken place here of late years is to make the title represent
a very much larger value than hitherto it has been possible it
should represent.
Now, sir, I turn to the Normal School of Mines, about which

my task will be easier, because Col. Donnelly has said something
about it. I have spoken of my respect and affection for the
older institution, the Royal School of Mines, with which I have
been so long connected, but I am not quite sure that, looking at
the matter from a broad and general point of view with reference
to the influence of our school upon the country, that I may not
have taken an even greater interest in the series of steps which
have led to the organisation of the Normal School of Science.
It is very hard for those whom I address, and who have not the
advantage or disadvantage of being as old as I am, to believe
that there was a time, hardly more than a score of years ago,
when it was almost impossible for any one who was not con-
nected either with the universities, with the medical schools, with
the School of Mines, or with one or two institutions in London,
to obtain the slightest tincture of practical scientific instruction in
this country. When, therefore, those conferences and delibera-
tions, to which Col. Donnelly referred just now, came to my
knowledge in the year 1859, I felt profoundly interested, and I
thought the plan proposed extremely well devised, and that it
was the only one, whatever its imperfections may be, which at
that time was adapted to meet the wants of the time. I confess

that organisation complete, we are endeavouring to give such
instruction to the teachers as will enable them to aid in this
business of picking out from the mass of youth under instruc-
tion those who are most likely to attain scientific distinction,
and to train and inform those who are likely to profit by scientific
instruction.
I am sorry, Sir, that I have detained you so long. It now
only remains for me to report to you that, at present, the number
of students in the Institution amounts to 198. I may say, that
in only one or two classes is there a slight falling off in numbers.
In several the numbers are enlarged, particularly in the metallur-
gical class, and in the geological class, in which latter the
demand for a system of instruction which has been established
h»re by my colleague, Prof. Judd, has been so considerable, that
several have had to be turned away for want of accommodation.
You will be glad to know that this system is so thorough and so
efficient, that from abroad men are sent to study its working.
The whole school is at present in a very healthy condition.
Some little difficulties attended its birth, as is very often the
case with strong and lusty infants ; but I think our infantile
complaints have all now subsided, and I hope that the institution

General Martin was then called upon to read the names of the
successful students. He said : The ceremony to-day of neces-
sity came so closely on to the heels of the examinations, that the
general lists could not possibly be made up. Only those awards,

gentlemen, in addition to those who receive the Associateship

are only the nucleus, so to speak, of numbers of exhibitions

tion for training, the men who have the faculty for science
teaching, and who will be the future teachers for science in this
country. I am sure no one can have been present to-day, and
have seen those young men advance to the table, and have seen
them receive their certificates of associateship, and their honour-
able awards for their successful studies, without feeling that
those men are going to carry to all the centres of industry an
amount of light and knowledge which will be of immense ad-
vantage, not only to themselves, but to the industry with which
they are associated. In every part of England there is a
demand for technical instruction, and that demand is very much
groping in the dark, for our people hardly understand what they
mean by it yet. It means they want to know the rationale of
the work which they are doing. They are tired of working by
rule of thumb, that when, as I have heard a Dyer explain how
he got certain results, he tried his alkalies and acids by dipping

components for some particular dye, he took a shovelful of this
and a shovelful of the other, and so arrived at c rtain results
which he could rarely arrive at with precision again, but which
was mere guesswork, rule of thumb, chance, and accident; all
that is passing away, and I believe, as the result of the good
work that is doing in this institution. I am sure you will all
join with me in expressing the hope that our Dean, who holds
that title for the first time during the last year, will long remain
at the head of this institution, to carry it to that success to
which he aspires, and which he has done his utmost, by his
noble effort and by his constant and eloquent advocacy, to

red stars whose places have been determined. In July and
August many nights were spent observing the two bright comets,
but the weather was so unsettled that only four observations of
Comet III. and two of Comet IV. could be secured on the
meridian.
In September a series of observations of stars between - 2°

made 713 observations of transits, and 582 observations of decli-

The meantime clock service has been continued throughout
the year. The circuit has been tested on 349 daysfrom July 1 up to June 14with the following results :
265 days' error not greater than 1 sec. 56 ,, between 1 sec. and 2 sees. 28 ,, greater than 2 sees.

SCIENCE IN BOHEMIA
A CORRESPONDENT, who was present at the recent
meeting of the Bohemian Naturalists, sends us the fol-
lowing brief report:
The second meeting of Bohemian Naturalists and Physicians
was held during May 24-30 in Prague (Nature, vol. xxvi.
p. 66). This meeting, in which over 600 members (some of
them coming from Poland) took part, seems to have proved
sufficiently that the above-named Slavic tribe (counting only
something over six millions of souls) is not less successful in
cultivating and promoting science in its own language, than other
small nations (Dutch, Swedes, &c).
In the two general meetings the following addresses were
given :By Dr. Schafarik, Professor in the Bohemian Univer-
sity, on the aims of chemical investigation, in which the subject
was treated from an unusually deep and philosophic point of
view; and by Dr. Holub, on the importance of the medical pro-

fession in transatlantic countries. In this address the essayist
pointed out that the great power which had been obtained by
the English in transatlantic countries is especially due to the
investigations made by them from the scientific, commercial,
economical, and strategical point of view. Dr. Holub further
referred to other experiences of that kind, which he made in his
travels in South Africa, already known to the readers of Nature
(vol. xxiv. pp. 35-38).

borates the results of that chemist, but disagrees with him as to
the economical value of the process. He has somewhat im-

the conversion of jS napthol into the amidonapthol thrcugh the
nitroso-compound, &c. The cost of Liebermann's process is
four times as great as the one originally proposed by Stenhcuse

ferric chloride as the oxidising agent.On some new compounds
of Brazilein and Haematein, by J. F. Hummel and A. G.
l'erkin. Extract of logwood is dissolved in hot water and when
cool, ammonia is added in slight excess. This solution, by
exposure to the air, deposits a dark purplish precipitate of
haematein, which, on purification, gave numbers indicating the
formula C16HlsO,; by the action of cold sulphuric acid, an
orange crystalline substance, C]6H06SOs was obtained. By
the action of hydrochloric acid in sealed tubes, hjdroxyl is
replaced by CI: C18HU05C1), a similar body is produced by
hydrobromic acid. Brazilein was prepared in a similar way
from Brazil extract. It forms compounds which resemble those
of buematein.On the determination of nitric acid as nitric
oxide by means of its reaction with ferrous salts, Part II., by R.
Warington. The method is founded on that proposed by

cessive treatments with oxygen and pyrogallol ; great care was
also taken to exclude all oxygen from the carbonic acid used.

by moistening the goods with sea-water and passing them

between two slowly-revolving carbon rollers, which were con-

was formed in the fabric, and on immersion in acid the
bleaching was effected. Results were also obtained with dilute

The time during which the light can penetrate by the aperture
into the apparatus, is l-20th second. By a simple replacement
in the apparatus, the mechanism can be so altered, that the light
coming from abovethat of the sky and cloudsacts a much
shorter time than that from other objects, so that, with I -20th
second of illumination, the exposure for the sky is not excessive.

THE GEOLOGY OF CHINA China: Ergcbnisse eigener Reisen unddarauf gegriindeter
Studien. Von F. Freiherrn von Richthofen. Zweiter
Band. (Berlin: Reimer, 1882.)
'HE second volume of Baron Ferdinand von Richt-
hofen's great work on China has just appeared.
Five years have elapsed since the publication of the first
volume, and two additional volumes are promised to com-
plete the work, which when its maps and full index have
been supplied, will be a great storehouse of observations
in almost every department of Geology. Few geologists
have enjoyed such opportunities of extended travel as
have fallen to the Baron's lot. Already familiar with the
rocks of a large part of Central Europe, he carried his
knowledge and experience to the far west of North
America, and did admirable service theie as a pioneer to
those who have [come after him. Subsequently he set
himself to explore the geological structure of the Chinese
Empire, and he is now laboriously collecting and arrang-
ing the vast materials which he amassed in his wanderings
through the almost unknown geological formations of that
wide region.

His chapters are arranged in the chronological order
of his journeys, and bristle with local details, which, how-
ever, are illustrated and made more readily intelligible by
numerous sections interspersed through the text, as well
as by sheets of coloured profiles. One of the most valu-
able features of the book for general readers consists in
the clear summaries of geological data which for each
great district are given in larger type. From these the
salient points in the geological structure of the different
provinces and their bearing on systematic geology may be
gathered by those who have not time to read the volu-
minous narrative of details. The author confers a fur-
ther and most welcome boon upon students by appending
to his volume a final chapter of " Geological Results,"
wherein he gives a succinct but clear and interesting out-
line of what he conceives to have been the leading events
in the geological history of China. As this outline is
accompanied throughout by references to the pages where
each subject will be found treated in ample detail, the
reader sees at once where to turn for fuller informa-
tion.
Baron von Richthofen divides the story of the geologi-
cal evolution of China into three chief periods. (1) That
of the formation and plication of the Archaean rocks ; (2)
that of the Palaeozoic rocks to the end of the Carboniferous
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
epoch; and (3) a vast continental period lasting from
Palaeozoic time up to the present day. The Archaean
gneiss, in highly inclined beds with a persistent N.N.W.
strike, is separated from all younger formations by a great
abrasion and discordance. It is succeeded by a younger
gneiss and by mica-schist, hornblende-schist, quartzite,
marble, coarse conglomerate, sandstone, and green slates,
some of which can be seen to lie unconformably upon it.
These various crystalline masses underwent enormous pli-
cation and subsequent denudation before the deposition
of the Palaeozoic series upon them. They are succeeded
Vol. xxvi.No. 663
by a vast mass of sedimentary material (12,000 to 20,000
feet thick) constituting the "Sinesian Series," in which
arenaceous rocks predominate in the lower and calcareous
in the upper portions. The occurrence of some forms of
Dikcllocephalus and Conocephalus and numerous brachio-
pods at the top of this series indicates that in part it re-
presents the period of the Primordial Fauna of Europe,
and the Potsdam Sandstone of North America. These
interesting and important fossils will be fully described in

is disposed to regard the steppe-period as contempo-
raneous with the Ice-Age in Europe; but no traces of
glaciation occur in Northern China. He reiterates his
well-known views regarding the origin of the Loess, and
cites a number of authors who have elsewhere been led to
the same conclusion, that the deposit is essentially a
subaerial one, formed by long-continued wind-drift with
the help of vegetation. That this conclusion is true for
the high arid regions of Asia and Western America can-
not be doubted by any attentive observer who has watched
what is now daily going on in either of these re-
gions. In his first volume the Loess was spoken of as
"subaerial"a term altered in the present volume into
"aeolian," which the author noticed for the first time em-
ployed geologically in Mr. Clarence King's Report on
the "Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel." It is a very
good term, but of much older date than the Baron sup-
poses, for he will find it in Captain Nelson's suggestive
paper on the Bahamas, published as far back as
1S52.

the author insists upon the paramount influence of the sea
as an agent in planing down the surface of the land.
"Regional abrasion," he affirms, "can only be accom-
plished by the advance of the breakers." This used to
be also the opinion of geologists in Britain, who from their
insular position and stormy climate had exceptional ad-
vantages in studying marine denudation. But there is
now a wide-spread conviction among them that the part
played by the sea in the levelling of land has been much
exaggerated. For the production of a plain of erosion
the co-operation of the sea is no doubt necessary. But
the abrasion of the land down to the level of the sea is
the work of the subaerial agents, and only the final touches
are given by the breakers. A "plain of marine denuda-
tion " is the surface down to which a terrestrial area has
been reduced. Its position and form were mainly deter-
mined by the lower limit of breaker action. But by far
the greatest amount of abrasion was done by wind, rain,
frost, rivers, glaciers, and other subaerial forces, which in
fact reduce the land to the level at which breaker action
could take effect. Oscillations of level might doubtless
assist the sea, but any such help would be of compara-
tively trifling value.

sylvestre should have put the editor on his guard; the
reference to Fuchs which he gives shows clearly that
some Allium was intended, and tracing the synonymy
through Bauhin to Linnaeus, we find that A. vinettle is
the species meant. Even apart from this evidence, it is
obvious that the "sellers of simples" who substituted
another herb for Teucrium Scordium would have selected
one that had a similar smell, and not one like the Colchi-
cum, which has no such odour. Mr. Mowat rightly iden-
tifies the "gosegresse" of the "Sinonoma" (p. 41) with
Potentilla Anserina; but it is hardly accurate to say that
it is "generally cleavers" (Galium Aparine). The
"Dictionary of English Plant-Names" shows that the
Potentilla is at least as frequently called'goosegrass now-
adays; and it is the "Gosgres" of the Old English

not Caltha, but the Marigold, Calendula officinalisj this
is made quite clear by the description under Kalendula,
which may be cited as an example of the capital diagnoses
which the glossary contains. "Kalendula est herba
crescens in hortis portans florem rubeum vel croceum de
quibus floribus faciunt sibi juvenculae coronas, solsequium

To make a glossary of this kind useful to other than
English-speaking students, the plants should be identified
with their Latin as well as by their English names. Even
in America, the mention of the cowslip would suggest, not
Primula veris but Calthapalustris. Mr. Mowat says (quite
correctly) that "pigle, pagle, paigle seems to be the regular
old name for cowslip"; and he seems to imply that the
entry "pigle, *. stichewort," may also refer to Primula
veris. But a previous entry, "Lingua avis, 1. stichewort, u
pigle," is quite sufficient to confirm the natural conclusion
that by stitchwort Stellaria Holostea (which is still com-
monly so called) was intended ; and this plant is called
pigle by Gerard in his appendix of " names gathered out
of ancient written and printed copies, and from the
mouthes of plaine and simple countrie people." Under
"Serpillum" we find the name "pelestre," which Mr.
Mowat queries "palustre?" but this is a form of Pelli-

to its former use in toothache. An instance of the insuf-
ficiency of English names is given in the gloss of " Um-
bilicus veneris, *'. penigresse," as "penny-grass, penny-
wort "; it is of course Cotyledon, not Hydrocotyle, which
is here meant, though the vernacular names are common
to the two plants.
In most cases, however, where Mr. Mowat has given a
modern synonym, it is correct; but I do not quite under-
stand why only comparatively few plants are identified,
as the identifications are by no means confined to cases
of special difficulty. Some very obvious explanations are
duly set forward, while in more doubtful cases help is
often not forthcoming.

existing collection of North American antiquities, I can safely
assert that they are totally abnormal in character, that is, unlike
any pre-Columbian stone carvings thus far found in the United
States. They neither show the characteristics of the stone
sculptures discovered in mounds, nor do they resemble the well-
known specimens of modern Indian art. In short, they are not
typical at all, unless, indeed, we deem them sufficiently important
to form a type for themselves. Such an importance, however,
I cannot concede to them, believing that they originated in com-
paratively modern, certainly in post-Columbian, times, and were
made by a few individuals of the Indian, or, perhaps, even of
the Caucasian, race. The rude attempts at imitating animals of
the Old World are conclusive evidences that the makers either
had seen such animals, or knew at least that they existed.
The carvings, it should further be taken into account, are
executed in soft potstone, a material easily yielding to the effects
of exposure, and hence a short lapse of time would have sufficed
to give them the appearance of real antiquities. In fine, I con-
sider these carvings as a modern intrusion, and would deem it an
extremely hazardous attempt to make them the basis for specu-
lations bearing on the ethnology of North America.

The Influence of Light on the Development of Bacteria
In Nature for July 12, 1877, there appeared a short com-
munication from Messrs. Downes and Blunt summarising the
conclusions at which they had arrived as the result of investiga-
tions on the influence of light on the development of lower
organisms. The experiments were described in detail in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1877 (vol. xxvi. p. 488),
and were considered by them to show that light is inimical to
the development of bacteria in Pasteur's solution; but that for
the full effect direct insolation is needed. Exposure to the sun's
rays, according to them, may simply retard development, or it
may completely sterilise the solution, by killing bacteria or their
germs contained in it. In a second paper read before the Royal
Society {Proceedings, vol. xxviii. p. 199), some further experiments
were detailed, which, however, did not, I venture to think, do
much towards settling the difficulties of the question. In the
same volume of the Proceedings (p. 212) Prof. Tyndall supplied
observations of his own, which confirmed the conclusions of
Messrs. Downes and Blunt, in so far as the retardation of de-
velopment was concerned, but differed on the point of sterilisa-
tion by bacterial destruction being attainable by insolation. At
the last meeting of the British Association, Prof. Tyndall re-
turned to the subject (Nature, September 15, 1881), and

related some further experiments confirming what he had
previously stated.
I have recently made a considerable series of experiments,
with the hope that under our bright Australian sun I might get
results decisive on the point of difference between these inquirers
and also confirming or negativing the result on which they were
agreed. I made use of Cohn's solution as the cultivation fluid
and common one-ounce phials as the vessels. The solution was
inoculated with a small quantity of fluid swarming with bacteria
{B. te, mo), the bottles plugged with cotton wadding and exposed
fully to the sun. Some of the experiments were made in the
hottest weather of February and March, and the later in April.
To begin with, I simply placed the bottles on the outside of a
window-sill, on which the sun shone during the greater part of
the day, a temperature of 1240 F. being noted on one occasion,
and that probably not the highest reached. My first results
seemed fully to confirm the conclusions of Messrs. Downes and
Blunt, complete sterilisation apparently being sometimes attained,
at least as far as bacterial growth was concerned, the destruction
of mould spores, as also noted by them, not being so easily
accomplished. Suspecting at last that the effect might possibly

Fireballs observed in the Netherlands
In the well-known "Meteoric Astronomy" of Dr. D. Kirk-
man, p. 67, is to be found the following note, on the occasion of
the interesting shower of dust and aerolites in Calabria on the
13th and 14th of March, 1813. "The date of this remarkable
occurrence is worthy of note, as a probable aerolite epoch.
From the 12th to the 15th of March we have the following falls
of meteoric stones. . . ." &c. (7 cases).
In reference to this note it may interest your readers that on
the night of 12-13 March last two great meteors were observed
in two different places in the Netherlands. The first observation,
made near the village of Haren (four and a half kilom. S. of
Groningen), by the schoolmaster, Mr. H. Bos, at I a.m., refers
to a bright fireball, shining with a splendid "bluish red" light,
illuminating the night, leaving a violet train, which lasted some

moments. The path seems to have been from a point not far
beneath the zenith, in an azimuth of 115° to another at 1080
azimuth, and had a length of 450, which was traversed by the
phenomenon in 4 or 5 seconds. After 85 secondsmeasured
afterw ards by means of a watch and by the distance of the objects
which the observer had passed, going with a known velocitya
full detonation, like a distant cannon-shot, was heard in the same
direction.
On the same night, and at the same hour, another fireball was
seen near the village of Bergen, in North Holland. The school-
master, J. Francken, gives me the following indications of its
path, found by him after having interviewed the observer. It
went from N.E. in altitude of 50° to S.E. in an altitude of a
little less than 40° It is therefore impossible that this pheno-
menon should be the same as the former, the direction of the
course being opposite. A second observer gave nearly the same
direction.
It is worthy of remark that another violet meteor had been
seen near Haren on March 12 at 8 p.m. in the S.W.1
A fourth meteor of the greatest size, described as being as
great as the full moon, was seen by three policemen, from whom
I have received tolerably harmonising records, though they were
standing in different positions in the town. The time of ap-
pearance was May I, at 4 a.m. precisely, or perhaps three
minutes afterwards, and the direction of the course was S.S.E.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
to N.N.E. It was described by one of the observers as beginning
like a shooting star (though already lightening the sky), falling
downwards and rising again in a curve from S.S.E. to N.N.E.,
increasing in the meanwhile to a great ball of a splendid purple
light, and showing a train of a silvery colour. The phenomenon
lasted 50 seconds (?) measured by a watch. No sound was heard.
The disappearance was instantaneous. It is uncertain if an ex-
plosion was really observed. The altitude seems to have been
at the beginning, and at the end point perhaps 10°, some-
what higher in the middle, as I have attempted to determine in loco.
The second observer estimated the duration of the phenomenon
to be 13 seconds. Even when this is accepted, the body must have
been very distant, and of a great volume, though increased
apparently by irradiation.
The same morning, at 3I1. 45m. a.m. there was also seen a great
meteor, going from W. to E. near Enumatil (8 kilom. W.), and
at Assen (S. from Groningen). It seems not to be identical with
the former. At Assen there was heard a buzzing sound. The
Enumatil observers compare the phenomenon, whose colour was
white with a red train, to a drum-major's staff. The Assen
observers speak of a bluish train or tail, which seemed to be

"Megaceros Hibernicus" in Peat
My friend, Dr. Leith Adams, has given it as his opinion that
the Irish elk is only found in the clay or marl under the peat,
while I contended that some of them occur in the peat, this
opinion being formed from reports of finds in the counties of
Limerick, Carlow, and Wexford, also from the colour and
appearance of the bones; still I could not be positive, as I had
not myself seen the bones raised out of the peat. Last week,
however, I heard from Capt. Woodrift, Kilowen Inch, Co.
Wexford, that he had found an elk's head in the peat, and I
went to see it. It was lying on its back altogether in the peat,
except some of the points of the horns. The portions in the
clay under the peat were quite hard, while those in the peat were
soft, but became quite hard a short time after they were taken
out.
The "Elk Hole" at Kilowen is a very remarkable place,
because, although very small, not 203 yards in diameter, yet at
the present time the remains of over ten skeletons of elks have
been taken out of it; while in the undisturbed portion of the
bog there are probably other skeletons. A few miles to the
south-west of Kilowen there is the small bog of Axe, in which

Perception of Colour
Happening to be reading out of door-, while the sun was
shining on my book, I noticed that patches of weed on the lawn
appeared peculiarly conspicuous in their difference of tint from
the grass. The same patches of weed close-cropped to the level
of the grass were ordinarily scarcely observable from difference
of colour. Now, as I looked up from my bookmy eyes
dazzled with the glarethey appeared to me to have a strong
blue tint. My attention thus being drawn to the point, I ex-
tended my observations, with the following results, which, if
new, will doubtless prove interesting to some of your readers.
I found that if the eye was exposed for two or three minutes to
the action of a very strong light, by looking at a sheet of white
paper, while bright sunshine fell on it, the capacity of the eye
for perception of colour was curiously modified, under certain
conditions. For example : if, on the instant after the exposure
of the eye to strong light, as describedsolarisation I will call
itflowers of various colours, placed in a shady part of a room
were examined, a pink rose appeared the colour of lavender;
dark crimson Sweet William, almost black; magenta Snap-
dragon, indigo ; scarlet Poppy, orange; the eye was, in fact,
red-blind. After a minute or two, the eye recovered its normal
sensibility to red, and the flowers assumed their natural colour.

In order to ascertain that the mal-perception of colour, under
the conditions described, was due to the action of strong light
on the eye, and not to any other circumstance, I repeated the
experiment, allowing the solarisation to take place on one eye
only, the other eye being kept shut until the moment of making
the observation. I then found, as before, that the solarised eye
was red-blind to objects in a subdued light for a minute or two
after solarisation, but sensitive to blue, and in less degree to
yellow, while the non-solarised eye was perfectly normal in its
perception of all the colours, liy alternately closing and open-
ing the solarised and non-solarised eye, the difference in colours
perceived by the two eyes was extremely strikingthe rose was,
as seen by one eye, pink, by the other eye, blue. It must be
remembered that the effects described were produced when the
flowers were observed in a room not strongly lighted.
When a corresponding experiment was made with the flowers
in the sunshine instead of in the shade, it was found that
a reverse effect was producedthat every colour, and red
particular, was intenser to the solarised eye than to the non-
solarised eyeas was readily seen by alternately shutting and
opening them. To the solarised eye a red rose-bud was deep

NATURE
The main engines drive the turbine, expelling the water
with considerable velocity through curved pipes or pas-
sages leading to "nozzles" placed on each side at the
level of the water-surface. When the vessel is going
ahead the jets are delivered sternwards; if it is desired to
move astern the engines are not reversed, but valves are
operated in the outlet pipes, and the jets are delivered
through the forward ends of the nozzles. These motions
of the valves can be made from the deck by an officer in
command. If desired, the jet on one side can be delivered
ahead, and that on the other side astern, the vessel then
turning without headway. This power of control over the
movements of the vessel, without reversing the engines, is
one of the chief advantages claimed for the system; and
it is undoubtedly of value, especially in war-ships.
Another advantage claimed for the jet-propeller is the
power of turning it on an emergency, into a powerful
pump, by which large quantities of water can be dis-
charged from the interior of a ship that has been damaged
in action. This latter feature cannot be regarded as of
primary importance, however, seeing that modern war-

ships are minutely sub-divided into water-tight compart-
ments, and must depend for their flotation upon the in-
tegrity of the bulkheads and other partitions, if their
skins have been broken through by ramming or torpedo-
explosions. A further claim on behalf of the jet-propeller
for war-ships is based upon the less risk of disablement
in action, as compared with screws or paddle-wheels; and
this claim may be admitted. On the other side must be
set the fact that all the trials made hitherto in vessels
fitted on the Ruthven system have shown a less speed for
a given amount of engine-power than would have been
obtained with the screw-propeller. It may be urged, of
course, that the decrease in speed should be accepted, at
least in special cases, in order to secure the undoubted
benefit of the hydraulic system. But the general feeling
of naval architects and marine engineers is in favour of the
use of twin-screws rather than water-jets for war-ships, the
duplication of machinery and propellers decreasing the
risk of disablement, giving great manoeuvring power, and
securing higher speed than could be obtained with the jet
propeller.
Recently further trials have been made with a vessel
built in Germany, from the designs of Dr. Fleischer, who
claims to have devised a novel and more efficient system
of hydraulic propulsion. A brief notice of the invention

appeared in Nature, vol. xxvi., p. 18; fuller details are
to be found in two pamphlets published by the inventor:
"Der Hydromotor," and "Die Physik des Hydromotors"
(Kiel, 1881). The first of these pamphlets contains a
general description of the system, as applied in the
Hydromotor (a vessel of 110 feet in length, and about 100
tons displacement), a summary of her trials, compared
with those of earlier vessels engined on Ruthven's system,
and an enumeration of the advantages to be obtained by
using jet-propellers instead of screws or paddles. The
second pamphlet contains a statement of the experi-
mental and mathematical investigations conducted by
Dr. Fleischer in working out his system.
Dr. Fleischer dispenses with a turbine, and allows the
steam to act directly upon the water in two large vertical
cylinders placed amidships. These two cylinders com-
municate with the ejecting nozzles which are situated on
either side of the keel. In each cylinder there is a "float"
or piston of nearly the same diameter as the cylinder,
with a closed spherical top; when this float is in its ex-
treme upper position, the cylinder is full of water. Steam is

the Hydromotor may be compared with the Waterwitch.
She gains upon the latter obviously in the avoidance of
much waste-work in the mechanism In the Ruthven
system there is necessarily more waste-work in the engines
which drive the turbines, and in the friction of the water
in the turbines and passages to the nozzles, than has to
be incurred in the Fleischer system. On the other hand,
in the latter system, there must be some loss from con-
densation of steam in the cylinders, and the high mean
velocity of ejection must be a disadvantage. The con-
siderable variations in the velocity of ejection at different
parts of the stroke must also be a disadvantage, as com-
pared with the uniform velocity of delivery from a tur-
bine. Respecting the condensation it is asserted, as the
result of experiment, that the losses are exceedingly small,
the cylinders being wood-lined, and a layer of hot water
being formed below the float. Experienced engineers
were scarcely prepared for this satisfactory result, antici-
pating that more serious losses would occur from the
alternate heating and cooling of the cylinders. Of course,
experience in such a matter is the true test; but it is to

be observed that the Hydromotor appears to have very
ample boiler-power in relation to the indicated horse-
power assigned to her maximum speed. Losses from
condensation cannot be estimated from the statement of
indicated horse-power. The indicator diagrams which
have been published, show a very good performance.
The varying rate of outflow through the nozzles must
be a source of disadvantage in the Fleischer system.
For the hydromotor it is stated that the mean velocity of
outflow was about 66 feet per second when the speed of
the vessel was about 15 feet per second. We are not
informed what was the maximum velocity of outflow; the
minimum velocity is said to have exceeded the speed of
the vessel. This varying velocity, of course, carries with
it a varying thrust, and the hydromotor in this respect
must be less favourable to uniform motion of the ship
than the screw or paddle or Ruthven propeller, where
the thrust can be kept practically constant. With two
cylinders this might be more felt than with four or more
cylinders, but in all cases the drawback must exist.
The high mean rate of outflow involved in the Fleischer
system is contrary to the generally accepted view as to
the condition most favourable to efficiency. For a given
speed of ship, neglecting the augment of tow-rope
resistance which may be caused by the action of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
propeller, there must be a certain thrust developed,
which will overcome the resistance of the water to the
advance of the ship. This thrust in the jet-propeller is
measured by the sternward momentum generated in the
jet* No matter how the mechanism may be arranged,
what has to be done by it is to impart to water which has
entered the ship and acquired her forward velocity, a
sternward momentum which shall have a reaction equal
and opposite to the fluid resistance. Momentum, it need
hardly be explained, involves the consideration both of
the weight of the water acted upon and of the velocity
imparted to it in each unit of time. Nor is it possible
to create this momentum in the water expelled from the
nozzles without doing waste-work in overcoming fric-
tional and other resistances. The magnitude of this
waste work may vary greatly in different examples, and
it is difficult to estimate its value apart from experiment.
Hence in theoretical investigations, this waste-work is
usually neglected, although in practice it is of great
importance.

It has been explained that the assumptions upon which
the first formula rests are not fairly representative of the
conditions of practice. For example, the deduction
therefrom (stated above), that it is advantageous to
operate upon larger quantities of water, and to reduce
the 'excess in speed of outflow above the speed of the
ship requires an important qualification in practice This
deduction would be absolutely correct were it not for the
waste-work which has to be done in giving the motion to
the water; but in actual practice the growth in that waste
work may exceed the gain obtained by dealing with larger

quantities of water. The parallel case in a screw steamer
is that wherein screws of too large diameter or too large
surface may involve so much more waste work on fric-
tional or edgewise resistances, that it is preferable to use
smaller screws, which operate on smaller quantities of
water, but secure a more economical expenditure of
power for a given speed, or enable higher speeds to be
attained with a given horse-power. In setting aside the
commonly received view, and making trial of a system
wherein the mean velocity of the outflowing jets is ex-
tremely great, while the quantity of water operated on is
small, Dr. Fleischer has made an experiment of the
greatest interest to all concerned with steam propulsion.
If his figures are accepted it is obvious that his system
involves much less waste work than the Ruthven system,
between the power indicated in the cylinders and the
power accounted for in the outflowing jets. On the other
hand, as we have endeavoured to explain, this economy
of the Fleischer system does not represent the compara-
tive efficiency of the propelling apparatus: because the
high and variable velocity of outflow must involve a con-
siderable amount of waste work in the race. A complete
comparison could only be made if in the same vessel, or

and secondly, the Ruthven arrangement. Then with the
same steam-producing power a careful series of trials
would settle the matter conclusively. The Swedes did
something of this kind in order to compare the efficiencies
of twin-screws and water-jets, with the result that the
latter were shown to be greatly inferior. Of course it
cannot be expected that Dr. Fleischer would undertake
such trials unaided; on the other hand, if his system is
put forward for adoption in preference to the Ruthven
system, it must, at least, be shown to be more efficient,
not only in certain intermediate stages in the operations
of giving momentum to the jets, but as a whole. This
result does not appear to have been attained as yet, so far
as can be judged from the published results of trials. The
information which is accessible is not complete, and some
of the proposed standards of comparison are open to
doubt. It is to be hoped, however, that the zeal and
ability which have been displayed already by Dr. Fleischer
will be still further illustrated in the continued investiga-
tion of the capabilities of his novel system of propulsion.

pearance of an almost circular disc elongated before and
behind by only a slight blur.
It may be said, how is it possible to give such brief
exposures as the above? I see no difficulty at all in the
matter. Let us take two examples, (1) of quick move-
ment, and (2) of very quick, but by no means the quickest
possible, movement. As regards the former, I can flip
with my forefinger, and with the greatest ease, a light
weight (such as a very small stone) nine feet up in the
air; now the maximum velocity of the tip of my fore-
finger is that of the initial velocity of the stone, which is
calculated at once by the usual formula, v = «/ 2 fs, or
taking 2 /= 64, which it is very nearly, v = 8 J s, the
units being in feet and seconds. The velocity in ques-
tion is therefore 24 feet, or 288 inches per second. As
regards a very rapid movement, we may take that of
the wing of a bird, which can undoubtedly be rivalled
mechanically. A pigeon is by no means the swiftest of
birds, but it can fly easily at the rate of 35 miles an hour,
and the part of the wing by which it is chiefly propelled
and which cannot be its extreme tip, must move much

more rapidly than this; let us say, very moderately, at
70 miles an hour, or 1,232 inches per second.
Now the duration of an exposure depends on three
data, namely, the rapidity with which the screen moves
past the eye, the width of the slit through which the
momentary glimpse is obtained, and the diameter of the
available portion of the pupil of the eye. I prefer not to
limit the pupil by using a small eyehole which is a source
of much trouble in actual work, but to have as large an
eyehole as is in any way desirable. I find the width of the
pupil of my eye in an indoor light as measured by holding
a scale beside it and reading off in the looking-glass, to
be about ot inch, and I use a slit of the same diameter.
The exposure begins when the advancing edge of the slit
is in front of the near edge of the pupil, and it ceases
when these conditions are reversed, in other words it lasts
during the time that the screen is occupied in moving
through one fifth of an inch. In the cases just taken of
velocities of 288 and 1,232 inches per second, the dura-
tion of the exposure would be the 1,440th and the 6,160th
part of a second, respectively. There is therefore no
difficulty either theoretical or practical about shortness of
exposure and sufficiency of illumination. The power
exists, and can be utilized, of seeing bodies in motion by
a rapid-view instrument, showing them in apparent still-

ness, and leaving a sharply-defined image on the eye,
that can be drawn from visual memory, which in some
persons is very accurate and tenacious.
I find on trial that great rapidity of exposure is in no-
wise essential for analysing the attitudes of a galloping
horse or a flying crow. The instrument I commonly
carry with me is a very rude one, but convenient for the
pocket, and is shewn below. The duration of the ex-
posure given by it under the action of its spring is the
360th part of a second, but the beginning and end of the
exposure ought not to count, so little light passing
through the edges of the pupil at those times that what is
then seen is relatively faint and is disregarded. I esti-
mate its practical duration at about one 500th of a second,
and it is rather less when the finger acts with a sharp tap
in opposition to the spring. The instrument is shewn in
Fig. 1, without its sliding lid, which protects it from injury
in the pocket. A is an arm which turns through a small
angle round C, its motion being limited by two pins. Its
free end carries a vertical screen, R R, which is a cylindrical
(or better, a conical sheet described) round an axis pass-

tion was a little slower than that of the movement, so that
each exposure should show a phase one step in advance
of the previous ones ; or, again, the rapidity of the periods
or that of the motion may be such as to make it necessary
to expose only at each second, third, or longer periodic
interval. This would be effected by the use of two discs
rotating at different velocities. Suppose, for example,
one to revolve three times while the other revolved twice,
then the two slits would be in accord in front of the eye-
hole only once in three revolutions.
In order to present the images formed by two succes-
sive glimpses as simultaneous pictures seen side by side
in the field of view, I took a prismatic eyeglass of the sort
sold by spectacle-makers to correct want of parallelism in
the optical axes. I cut it in two pieces, and placed these
in opposite ways in front of two horizonal slits, lying one
above the other in a shutter that fell vertically between
slides. When the first slit came in front of the eye, the
image it transmitted was deflected four degrees to the
left; and when the second slit followed it, its image was
deflected four degrees to the right, and two apparently
simultaneous pictures were produced. Also, by crossing
the prisms I found it would be easy to construct an ap-

paratus with four successive slits shewing four images;
1, up to the left, 2, up to the right ; 3, down to the left,
and 4, down to the right. I doubt, however, whether
this would be often found a useful development of the
instrument, owing to the difficulty of watching more than
a small area with attention.
I noticed an important optical effect, namely that the
image first seen was always considerably fainter than the
others, showing that its brightness had faded in the brief
interval that elapsed before comparison began. It would
appear that the law of the rate of fading could be investi-
gated by this apparatus. I have not now the opportunity
of dcing so myself, but if I had, I should mount two
prisms below radial slits in a disc that was revolving
steadily at a known velocity, and I should watch a cir-
cular wafer through them. The width of the slits would
be adjustable, and so would the angular distance of the
prisms, and I should measure under various circumstances
the width of the second slit that was necessary to tone
down its image to an equal brightness with that seen
through the first. Or the investigation might be made
without prisms, by using two wafers and watching them
with the same eye through slits at different radial dist-
ances, separated by various angular intervals, the adjust-
ments being such that only the outside wafer should be

THE CHEMISTRY OF THE PL/INTE AND

PART I Il.-The Disrhargc qf Me Cell
THE two plates of a Planté or Faure battery consist
essentially of lead peroxide as the negative element,
and metallic lead in a spongy condition as the positive.
These are brought into communication with one another
through the lead plates which support them, together
with the connecting wire.
The lead peroxide reacts both with the lead plate that
supports it, and with the lead on the opposite plate. At
first sight, it might be expected that the reaction between
it and the supporting plate would be the greater, as the
space between them is so small, and the resistance of the
intervening liquid in consequence almost inappreciable.
The action is,_indeed, probably greater at the first moment,
but, as explained in our first paper, sulphate of lead is
immediately produced, and that which lies at or near
the points of junction, forms no doubt a serious obstacle

an experiment in which the external resistance was 1 ohm,
and the internal o-58 ohm, the E.M.F. sank in forty-five
minutes from 2-25 to ro,2, but after being disconnected
for thirty minutes, it was found to have risen to 1 '96, and
after eighteen hours' repose it had actually risen to 1 98
volts. These observations were made many times in
succession during the course of the experiment, which
lasted six days.
With twenty times the external resistance, the diminu-
tion of electromotive force was much slower ; but after
discharging three days, the fall was more pronounced,
and the rise on repose very apparent.
With 100 ohms resistance, the electromotive force varied
very little for three days.
It is more difficult to obtain satisfactory chemical evi-
dence of a quantitative character. It is clear that as
chemical examination means the destruction of the sub-
stances, the same plate cannot be analysed in two con-
secutive stages. Nor can two plates be easily compared
with one another, although they have been formed under
the same circumstances. Even the same positive plate,

during or after discharge, presents to the eye very different
appearances in different parts. To a certain extent we
obviated this difficulty by cutting the plate in two, longi-
tudinally, analysing the one half at once, and allowing
the other to repose for a given time before examining it
for peroxide of lead.
As to the estimation of peroxide in the presence of
metallic lead, we finally adopted as the best method
that of reducing it by means of oxalic acid, although we
were not certain that the whole amount is obtained in this
way, even though the solution be kept hot for a consider-
able time.
By this method many chemical examinations were
made of the positive plate. The results are as follows :
First of all, when the external resistance did not exceed
20 ohms, the peroxide of lead was generally visible in
patches, and its presence was demonstrated and approxi-
mately measured by various chemical tests. On repose,
the quantity of this peroxide visibly diminished, and in
the majority of instances the chemical analyses also
showed a smaller amount. In all cases sulphate of lead
makes its appearance early in the action, and gradually
increases in quantity, becoming finally the only product
of the discharge.
The deposit on the negative plate shows the presence
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of nothing but sulphate of lead in addition to the un-
changed peroxide. At the conclusion of the action, we
have always found more or less of this substance unal-
tered. Thus, as one instance, after a discharge lasting
five days, and approximately complete, we found that
only 6S per cent, of the deposit was lead sulphate.
We conclude therefore that the chemical action of the
discharge is essentially what is expressed by the following
theoretical formula :
Pb02 I H2S04 I HS04 I Pb = PbO | HaO | HaS04 j
PbS04,
which becomes
PbS04 I H20 I H20 I PbS04.
This reaction is, however, sometimes complicated by the
formation of a small amount of peroxide of lead on the
positive plate. We believe this to be due to the oxidation
of sulphate, an action which was explained in our last
paper.
Another conclusion has reference to the resuscitation of
power observed on repose. This is not due to any purely
physical action but is a necessary consequence of the

continuity of the mandibular and hyoid arches, appears
to me to be absolutely incontrovertible.
As far as I have seen, there is no other type in which
the hyoid"cornu" is chondrified continuously with Meckel's
cartilage, or the endoskeletal lower jaw.
This may be an acquired peculiarity, but I rather in-

aborted by the continuity of its upper half with the lower
jaw.
The rest of the arch resembles the branchial arch of a
fish, and is like the proper hyoid arch of a Chimaera ; the
segments correspond very closely, but there is one piece
too many, but this intercalary piecethe "inter-hyal"
is found in ganoid and osseous fishesuniting their
hyomandibular with their epihyal.
This fish-like hyoid soon becomes a continuous bar, as
in the New Zealand Lizard (Hatterid), where the auditory
columella and the hyoid arch are one continuous struc-
ture.
That condition, however, in the Crocodile, is only
continued through the middle part of the term of incuba-
tion; towards the latter part of the time the parts that
were fused all come to pieces again, and the ripe young

are remnants of the epi-, inter-, and cerato-hyalsthe
latter become free from the lower jaw during the middle
of the incubating period.
The complex triple Eustachian tubes are formed after
the middle of incubation, but before that time the basis
cranii had become hollowed out, and so also had the
quadrate and the articular end of the mandible.
By the time of hatching there are in the complex
tympanic labyrinth or diverticula of the 1st visceral cleft,
the following parts, namely :
a. The drum-cavity hollowed out of the quadratum.

It was on November 21, 1881, that the Austrian Lloyd
steamer Helios, bearing Prof. Haeckel and his numerous
chests, some containing scientific instruments, others
empty for the reception of specimens, came to an anchor
in the harbour of Colombo. He describes in a few
graphic words the vision of beauty which met his eager
gaze as the morning twilight cleared away, and the island,
with its fringe of delicate palm forests, and more thickly
wooded interior highlands, crowned in the centre by the
mysterious summit of Adam's Peak, expanded before him
in all the blaze of tropical sunshine. Directly in front lay
the fort and harbour, to the right (or south) the beautiful
suburb of Colpetty, in 'which the majority of the Euro-
peans have their residence, and to the left (or north), the
Pettah or "Black town," inhabited by the native races.

Lloyd, in whose bungalow, on the northern side of the

farther from Colpetty, he passed the two first weeks of his
stay in Colombo, which he describes as among the most
delightful of his life. His first drive in Ceylon, from the
Fort to Whist Bungalow, through the Pettah, opened out
before him. as he himself says, a quick succession of
scenes of Eastern beauty. The brown clay huts of the
natives, each with its garden of cocoa-nut palms and
plantains ; the motley population of red-brown Singhalese,
and darker Tamils, grouped round the doors, carry-
ing on all their domestic concerns in the open air,
combined with the bright red tint of the soil to
produce bewildering contrasts of form and colour,
together with a charming impression of primitive sim-
plicity, and harmony with surrounding nature. It would
be impossible to make even a passing mention of the
Singhalese and their domestic life without digressing
into a description of their most valued and often their
only possession, the cocoa nut palm of whose substance
every part is turned by them into account.
"The number of cocoa palms on the island,'' says Prof.
Haeckel, " is calculated at 40,000,000, each palm yielding
from 80 to 100 nuts (8-10 quarts of oil). It is not
found in the northern half of the island, nor on a
great part of the eastern coast. Its place is here supplied
by the not less useful palmyra palm {Borassus flabclli-

formis). This is the same which covers the hot and
dry districts of Hindostan, growing in great profusion
near Bombay. Even from a distance the two palms vary
greatly. The palmyra is a fan-palm, with a strong, very
straight black stem, topped by a thick bunch of fan-
shaped leaves. The cocoa, on the other hand, is a
feather-palm, its slender white stem, 60 to 80 feet high,
is gracefully curved, and adorned with a bushy crown of
feathery leaves. The lovely Areca palm (Arcca catechu)
has similar, but stiffer and smaller leaves, and a tapering
reed-like stem; it is an invariable feature of a Singhalese
garden, carefully tended for the sake of the nut, which,
being chewed together with the leaf of the betel pepper,
colours the teeth and saliva red. Another palm, the
Kitool (Caryota urens) is cultivated chiefly on account of
its abundant sugar-sap, from which palm-sugar (Djaggcri)
and palm wine {Toddy) are prepared. Its stiff strong
stem supports a crown of double-feathered leaves re-
sembling those of the maiden-hair fern (Adiantum
capillus Veneris)."

An interesting telephonic experiment was made on Tuejday at
Malta, during the bombardment of the Forts at Alexandria. A
telephone was attached at Malta to the Alexandria cable, and con-
nection was made with the other end of the cable on board the
CAiltern, off AJexandria. It was found that, owing either to the
distance, or to the vibration caused by the firing, it was imprac-
ticable to send a verbal message, but the firing at Alexandria
was distinctly heard, through the telephone, at Maltaa distance
of more than a thousand miles.
A VISIT was paid on Tuesday to the School of Military Engi-
neering and the Royal Engineer establishment at Chatham by
the members of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Elec-
tricians. Over 500 of the members, associates, and friends of
the society accepted the invitation of the president, Col. Webber,
R. E., and were entertained by him at luncheon at the Royal
Engineers officers' mess. The guests were shown over the
schools, following a programme arranged by the Acting Com-
mandant, and conducted by the officers of the Royal Engineers,
who were indefatigable in providing for the entertainment of all.
A lecture on torpedo warfare was delivered in the theatre by

the Engineers' Field Park, the mechanical workshops, the con-
struction of military bridges, use of brushwood for military pur-
poses, siege batteries, earthworks, demolition of railways and
stockades, also submarine mine explosions, afforded a most in-

From the Italian Census of December 31, 1881, it appears
that in 23 out of 24 provincial chief towns the number of persons
knowing how to read and write has greatly increased since 1871.
In ten years the citizens of Udine had increased in such know-
ledge at the rate of 9 per cent.; in Como, 6'50 per cent.
Brescia made a strange exception; in 1871 there were 2899
persons ignorant of reading and writing, and in 1881 this number
was increased to 3120 persons; data are wanting to explain this
fact. In the 24 capitals of provinces the average result is that a
little more than 50 per cent, of the inhabitants know how to read

Messrs. TrI'bner and Co. have issued a second and much
enlarged edition of their '' Catalogue of the Principal Languages
and Dialects of the World." The original catalogue contained
about 1100 titles on 64 pages, while this [edition enumerates
nearly 3000 titles on 170 pages. The utility of such a catalogue
to students of language is obvious.
With praiseworthy promptness Messrs. Blackie and Son
have issued the third volume of the new edition of the Imperial
Dictionary, edited by Mr. Charles Annandale. This volume
extends from L to Screak, and in all respects is up to the two
first volumes. The only omission of importance we detect is
Photophone, which perhaps came too late to be pat in its proper

A French engineer has originated a plan by means of which
passing ships could send messages by submarine cables; he

the Moniteur dt la Flotte considers that the plan presents but
few difficulties, and would obviate much anxiety and many
dangers.

foundations of the ancient cities. Two perfectly distinct cities
have lately been discovered in the burnt stratum, the lower one
resting on the large walls which have hitherto by mistake been
attributed to the second city. Hissarlik now turns out to have
been the Acropolis of this lower burnt city, this being proved
by the walls and the pottery, as well as by two vast brick build-
ings, one of them 43 feet broad by 100 feet long, the other 23 feet
broad by less than ico feet long. These buildings seem to have
been temples, a separate gateway, flanked by enormous towers,
leading up to them. There are, besides, three or four large
buildings, apparently dwelling-houses, but no smaller buildings.
The city walls now stand out very imposing. They rest on a
substructure of large blocks, 33 feet high, afterwards superseded
by great brick walls. All the treasures formerly found by Dr.
Schliemann are now ascribed to the first burnt city. Dr. Schlie-
mann has found in the temples copper nails of a very peculiar
shape, weighing from 1000 to 1190 grammes. The second
burnt city, being the third city from the rock, and hitherto identi-
: Troy, turns out to have had but very small
houses and no lower town at all. Dr. Schliemann will continue his excavations till the beginning of August.

NATURE
reaction CO,+ C = CO + CO shows that out of two volumes of
CO. we receive four volumes of CO, and it is accompanied with
absorption of heat, which is determined by the fact that the
combustion of one atomic weight of carbon develops 97 K (i.e.
97 great calorics, or 97,000 common ones), while the combus-
tion of CO develops 68'4 K ; the reaction is thus accompanied
by the following thermal result : 97-oK-2 x 68-4 K = - 39'8K.
The result (97"o-6S-4-68'4= - 398 K) is the same for the
following reaction : H,O + C = C0 + Hs; and, if the combustion
of hydrogen in the calorimeter were not accompanied by a
formation of liquid water, it might be admitted that the combus-
tion of CO and of Hs develops the same amount of heat, which,
however, is not the case.
After having shown how the conclusions on the heat of for-
mation of hydrocarbons from hydrogen and coal, or diamond,
are vitiated by not taking into account the heat developed, or
absorbed, by physical and mechanical processes, and how M.
Thomsen (Berliner Bcrichte, 1880, p. 1321) was brought to
erroneous conclusions as to the structure of the molecule of coal
and diamond, as well as to the structure of hydrocarbons; M.
Mendeleef says:"In using calorimetrical data of chemical

reactions to judge of the variation of chemical energy in a re-
action, it is necessary to free them from the influence of physical
and mechanical processes which accompany the reaction. Of
course, the relative influence of these secondary processes is not
very great, as the chemical process is the most important one,
especially in such energetic reactions as the combustion of hydro-
carbons; but it is important, for strictly maintaining the prin-
ciple itself of thermo-chemistry, always to apply this correction,
as we always apply the correction for loss of weight in the air,
especially when weighing gases." "Only in the gaseous stale
can we consider the thermal relations of bodies free from the
influence of the modified internal work, as was well pointed out
by Berthelot in the first chapters of his work: 'Essai de
Mecanique chimique'; therefore, all comparisons must be made
iu the gaseous state, as well for the bodies entering into reaction,
as for those which we receive. When the determination of the
heat of combustion is made for solid or liquid bodies, we ob-
viously must add the latent heat of evaporation (and liquefac-
tion) of the body, and deduct the latent heat of evaporation of
water. This last is well known, and for a molecular weight in
grarmnes (18 grammes) of water, it is equal to about 107 K at
the temperature of 15° to 20° Cels. As to the heat of evapora-
tion of hydrocarbons, it is still not sufficiently known. But we
know that the heat necessary for the evaporation of molecular
quantities of different bodies comparatively volatile, varies from
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
4 K (as for NHj and N20) to 15 K (as for quicksilver and ethyl),
and usually is between 6 K to 10 K." This correction not being
very great, and the determinations of heat of combustion not
being yet very accurate, Prof. Mendeleef takes, for those bodies
whose heat of evaporation is not yet determined, an approxi-
mate correction. Another correction is that which results from
changes of volume of combining bodies. The mechanical work
which results from this increase or decrease of volume is not
very great (057 K in most of the determinations of Thomsen),
but always must be taken into account.
By applying these corrections, Prof. Mendeleef gives a new-
corrected table of heats of combustion of twenty different
hydrocarbons, as well as the heats of formation of these bodies
from CH4, CO, and C02. The corrections are not insignifi-
cant, as, for instance, for hydrogen, CII4, CJH", C3H5, and
OH10, whose heats of combustion, as determined by Thomsen,
Berthelot, and Loughinin, are respectively68'4, 2i3-5, 3735,
S33'S> an<l H37'4; 'he corrected figures, as given by M.
Mendeleef, areS7'4, 192, 342, 492, and 1062.

locate them, as well as to determine their light. A wedge
inserted in the field of a transit instrument will permit the deter-
mination of the light of each star observed without interfering
with the other portion of the observation. If the stars are all
bright, time may be saved by dispensing with the thin portion of
the wedge. In equatorial observations of asteroids the light
may be measured photometrically with little additional expendi-
ture of time. Perhaps the most useful application would be in
the observation of zones. When the stars are somewhat scat-
tered it would often happen that their light might be measured
without any loss of time. By this instrument another field of
usefulness is opened for the form of horizontal telescope advo-
cated at a former meeting of this Academy (Proc. Amer. Acad.
XVI. 364). Very perfect definition would not be required,
since it would affect all the stars equally. To an amateur who
would regard the complexity of an instrument as a serious objec-
tion to it, a means is now afforded of easily reducing his esti-
mates of magnitude to an absolute system, and thus rendering
them of real value.

*¦ Peak Monthly Abstract Journals, have been very kindly
forwarded to us by General Hazen, the chief of the U.S. Signal
Service, in accordance with a request made by us; we believe
their publication will prove useful:
November 23, 1873.Atmospheric electricity manifested itself
when line was broken by a crackling sound when binding screws
were touched, and bright sparks drawn when storepipe was
touched by my fingers.
December 7, 1873.While line was broken I heard relay
working; thinking line had been repaired, I hastened to adjust;
received a severe shock, which convinced me that something
stronger than our battery had charged the wire. Instrument cut
out and lightning arrester screwed closer; in a few minutes a
continuous stream of electricity passed between the two plates of
the arrester with a loud noise, resembling that produced by a
child's rattle; the fluid parsed not in sparks, but in five or six
continuous streams of light, as thick as a pencil lead, for two or
three minutes at a time, with short intervals between; this con-
tinued for over an hour.
December II, 1873.On retiring I accidentally touched my
drawers with two fingers of my hand, and drew two sparks from
them. This is a common phenomenon after a snow-storm.
January 12, 1874.Electric shocks.
January 24, 1874.Received electric shock when opening
stove door; as usual, it was not repeated.

February 25, 1874.Same as January 24.
May II, 1874.During the entire day severe shocks were felt by
any one touching the wire, and, the line being open, I could
make plain signals with the key for about ten minutes.
May 20, 1874. p.m., report could not be sent on account
of atmospheric electricity (a thunder-storm).
May 21, 1874.A flash of fire alxiut two feet long leaped
from arrester into the office, illuminating the rooms.
May 24, 1874.A heavy thunder-storm passed slowly and
directly over the peak; large sparks passed constantly through
the arrester, while a strange crackling of the snow could be
heard at times. While making the 2 p.m. observation, I heard
the snow crackle as above mentioned, and felt at the same time
on both temples, directly below the brass buttons of my cap, a
pain as if from a slight burn. Putting up my hands, there was
a sharp crack, and all pain had disappeared.
May 29, 1874.At 6.20 a terrific storm commenced; blinding
flashes of fire came into bath-rooms from the lightning-arrester
and stoves; loud reports followed in rapid succession.
July 1, 1874.A party of visitors were caught in a thunder-
storm not far from the summit, and all state that they experienced

July 13, 1S76.Singing on the wire. It also seemed to
come from the instrument shelter and the house, as well as
from the wire. Thunder loud and continuous during the
afternoon.
July 23, 1876.The anemometer stopped working on account
of the electric storm. Privates Straine and O'Keefe were
shocked while trying to fix it, so that they had to give it up
until the storm had subsided somewhat.
August 18, 1876.A beautiful phenomenon was observed by
myself, Private Greenwell, and four visitors. The peculiar
singing noise (or suzing noise) was heard again, always before
in day, but this time at night, but the line for an eighth of a
mile was distinctly outlined in brilliant light which was thrown
out from the wire in beautiful scintillations. Near us we could
observe these little jets of flame very plainly. They were in-
variably in the shape of a quadrant, and the rays concentrated at
the surface of the line in a small mass about the size of a currant,
which had a bluish tinge. These little quadrants of light were

constantly jumping from one point of the line to another, now
pointing in one direction then in another. There was no heat to
this light, and when I touched the wire I could only feel the
slightest tingling sensation. Not only was the wire outlined in
this manner, but every exposed metallic point and surface was
similarly tipped or covered. The cups of the anemometer
appeared as four balls of fire revolving slowly round a common
centre. The wind vane was outlined with the same phos-
phorescent light, and one of the visitors was very much alarmed
by sparks, which were plainly visible in his hair, though none
appeared in ours. At the time of this phenomena snow was
falling.
March 27, 1877.Singing noise heard upon the wire to-
day.
May 12, 1877.Hailstorm, accompanied by intense electricity.
May 24, 1877.Sergeant Hobbs and Private Greenwell
received severe shocks during the day.
August 6, 1877.Intense electricity; all metal objects were
tipped with sparks.
November 25, 1877.Snow-storm all day attended by intense
electricity, which could be heard crackling in a person's hair
continuously, although no reports of thunder were heard.
December 26, 1877.The atmospheric electricity was very
intense during the day, and at times would crackle on various
objects in the room.

January 25, 1878.Several thunderstorms occurred in the
surrounding parks and gulches. The electricity on the summit
was very intense, causing a continuous snapping of the lightning
arrester.
May 12, 1878.A snow-storm commenced during the night,
and at 1 p.m. was drifting furiously by a rising gale. The elec-
tricity varied with wind-gusts, and was so intense at times as to
render our position exceedingly dangerous. The telegraph wires
were cut out, but violent sparks would still jump six inches
lietween the disconnected windows. One violent discharge
seemed to have occurred in the chimney, for a terrible commo-
tion was caused in the soot and ashes.
May 24, 1878.At 8 p.m. snow commenced, attended with
severe electricity, lasting for an hour. The wires had to be cut
out and parted, and a vivid glaring was continuous in the win-
dows. A lamp set in the north window would, with its flame,
cast a shadow on the opposite wall for several seconds.
July I, 1878.During afternoon sleet fell, accompanied by
intense electricity. At 3.20 a violent explosion occurred in the
room, near the stove, scattering the wood and knocking down
the stove-pipe.

his son, M. Vilhelm Bjerknes, delivered a lecture on " Hydro-

tism," which was illustrated by experiments and projections on
the screen. Prof. Bjerknes has been engaged in tracing these
analogies for the last twentv-five years, at first mathematically,
but latterly by experiments in verification of the deductions from
his formulae. These experiments were shown in the Paris Elec-
trical Exhibition last year, and have been published repeatedly
in this country. Dr. Bjerknes has, however, advanced beyond
the results there shown. These were chiefly confined to
illustrating the static attractions and repulsions of electricity and

dynamic attractions and repulsions. The former effects are
shown by brass balls oscillating, or by small tambours pulsating,
near each other in water. These motions are communicated to
the balls and drums by pulses of air transmitted from an inge-
nious air-pump or bellows along india-rubber tubes. A pul-

sating drum corresponds to a magnetic pole ; an oscillating body
to a magnet. When two tambours are vibrating near each other
in like phase, they attract; when in unlike phase, they repel
each other. The same holds true of the oscillating balls. The
motion-lines round these bodies correspond to the lines of force
round magnets, as was demonstrated by a hollow ball oscillating
or a stem, and tracing its movements in ink on a glass plate. All
the phenomena of magnetic forces were illustrated in this way
by Prof. Bjerknes, including diamagnetism, which was shown by
means of pith cylinders lighter than the water or medium of oscil-
lation. A pulsating drum or oscillatory ball repelled the cylinder
of pith, whereas it attracted a cylinder of wax, which is heavier than
the water. The more novel part of the experiments consisted in
representing the attraction between two electric currents flowing
in the same direction by means of two cylinders about five inches
long and one inch in diameter, oscillating round their longitudinal
axes at close quarters in the water. The cylinders were oscillated
by means of a pulsating tambour which communicated its motion
to them by a toothed gearing on their ends. Attraction
resulted when the oscillations of the cylinders were opposed to
each other, and repulsion when they were in the same direction.

PERMANENCE AND EVOLUTION
Permanence and Evolution; An Enquiry into the Sup-
posed Mutability of Animal Types. By S. E. B.
Bouverie Pusey. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, and
Co., 1882.)
THIS is a thoughtful little book, clearly and ably
written, with the view of showing, as its Preface
states, "that while Darwinism proper is improbable,
evolutionism in any form is as yet unproved; while, on
the other hand, the more we investigate the facts of in-
heritance, the more we are compelled to regard differences
so slight, that they would usually be considered casual
variations, as within the limits of our existing knowledge
strictly permanent." Such being his theme, Mr. Pusey
introduces it with the following very appropriate and
judicious apology, which we quote in order to show the
spirit which throughout characterises his work.
"It may seem almost presumptuous on the author's
part to attempt to reopen once more the whole question
of evolution, especially as in doing so it is necessary to
call in question the views of so many very eminent men
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:10 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
of science. At the same time, any one who calls attention
to any neglected facts, or who questions assumptions too
carelessly allowed to pass muster, helps to elucidate the
subject of which he treats, and so aids the cause of scien-
tific knowledge, whether the particular views he propounds
are right or wrong."
Having already observed that the work is one of
marked ability, we have only further to preface our
analysis of it by fully assenting to this justification.
Although, as we shall immediately proceed to show, we
do not think that Mr. Pusey has been successful in his
tilt against the stone wall which has been reared by the
school of Darwin, we nevertheless respect his independent
disregard of mere authority, as we think that such disre-
gard always deserves to be respected in matters of science
where evidence is shown by the malcontent of clear and
forcible thought of his own upon the doctrines which he
undertakes to criticise.
The principal part of" Permanence and Evolution " is
occupied with a criticism of the argument from classifica-
tion, and especially that part of the argument which has
reference to domestic animals. In the author's view Mr.
Darwin has failed to prove in the case of any domestic
animal that artificial selection has produced a new variety
or sub-species. Thus of the varieties of the dog he says,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"seeing how true they breed, I do not see why the prin-
cipal and best marked (the greyhound, the mastiff, the
terrier, the spaniel, &c.) should not have so existed (i.e. in
a state of nature), and the others have been formed by
crossing between them." Similarly of the pigeon he says
there is no sufficient evidence to show that all the fancy-
breeds were not once natural breeds which have since
become extinct as such, or that their occasional reversion
to the rock dove is not due to an ancient cross with it.
"As these races resemble the rock dove, and each other, in
everything except one or two conspicuous points, it need
not surprise us that they produce perfectly fertile off-
spring," &c. Thus also he treats of the cases of all the
other domestic animals alluded to by Darwin.
Vol. xtti.No. 661
Concerning this mode of criticism, it seems enough to
point out the cumulative improbability of all the domestic
races of animals having once been wild (notwithstanding
the apparent unfitness of some of them to a self-dependent
mode of life), added to the further cumulative improba-
bility of all these wild races having become extinct. We

266
{July 20, 1882
NATURE
Mr. Pusey's treatment of the evidence from rudimentary
organs does not seem to us more fortunate. His only
criticism here is that because organs are rudimentary we
have on this account no warrant for concluding that they
are useless; "if these aborted structures were the only
ones in which we could see no use, then the explanation
would have some locus standi." But here the important
fact is lost sight of that all rudimentary organs are the
homologues of organs which when of larger size present
observable utility. Can it be reasonably supposed that
in the case of all the thousands of these "aborted struc-
tures," some new function, always unobservable, is per-
formed by an organ which by some strange chance happens
to be the homologue of an organ which when of larger
size performs some other and observable function?
Again, the argument from embryology obtains but very
scant justice; only three pages are devoted to it, and the
core of the subject is not touched. For the force of this
argument does not consist in our seeing " a vast number
of animal forms, many of which are very like each other,
and their distinctions less pronounced in youth," or in
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:10 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
such cases as that of the stripes on the young lion, &c.
The force of the argument consists in the progressive
imitation of lower morphological types by the successive
embryonic stages of higher ones; and of this very
remarkable fact Mr. Pusey takes no notice.
The argument from palaeontology is dismissed in a
similarly bigh-handed fashion, but somewhat more con-
sideration is given to the argument from geographical
distribution. The view advanced is "that the facts of
distribution can, to a great extent, be shown to have
originated in an opposite manner, not by the origination
of new forms, but by the destruction of old ones." If
this could be shown, no doubt the proof would be one of
much importance to science, and would serve largely to
modify the argument from distribution; but the fact
certainly has not been proved, or even shown to be gene-
rally probable, by the book before us.
Concerning the specially Darwinian theory of evolution
Mr. Pusey says that personally he thinks " whatever else
is the origin of species, natural selection certainly is not.'' His reasons for this opinion are that a priori the way in
which we should expect natural selection to act "would
be by conferring fertility, hardiness, and early maturity"
(none of which qualities are presented by the higher
Primates); and also that allied animals living on the
same areas and apparently exposed to similar conditions
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of life, are nevertheless "dissimilar in a number of minor
points, apparently unconnected and without teleological
purpose." Now concerning the first of these objections, it
seems enough to observe that a priori considerations of this
kind are extremely hazardous. Fertility, hardiness, and
early maturity may all be good for species, and yet other
qualities (perhaps incompatible with them) may be even
better, such as high nervous organisation, intelligence,
&c. In short, where the conditions of the problem in
any given case are so many and complex, it would be idle
to determine beforehand what qualities we should expect
natural selection to lay a premium uponas much so, for
instance, as to say, after the event, that a man would be
better suited in his environment if he had had a very
much more brutal constitution, could run about like a
chicken when a few hours old, and was the most prolific
animal in creation. And of course the other difficulty,
being of a similarly a priori kind, admits of being simi-
larly met. There may be a thousand unobservable
reasons why, after a long course of evolution, allied
species living on the same areas should be dissimilar in

German students, and its introduction is to be regretted,
as it is likely to deter scientific students from taking up
crystallography.
In the special part devoted to the several systems, Dr.
Liebisch proceeds from the principle of symmetry, in
which, however, he defines his systems by means of axes
and a centre of symmetry, instead of by planes of sym-
metry. This is done with a view to include the hemi-
hedral forms in the same definition as the holohedral
ones, and to obviate the difficulty arising from the hemi-
hedral forms being excluded when the system is defined
by means of planes of symmetry. One doubts, however,
whether the advantage gained is sufficient to compensate
for the loss of simplicity. Dr. Liebisch has made a
curious slip in his definition of symmetry, being appa-
rently carried away by his love of generalisation. He
shows that the internal and external bisectors of an angle
divide symmetrically the spaces portioned out by this
angle, and that the four lines form a harmonic pencil.
He then generalises this relation, and leads one to suppose
that symmetry always exists when a pencil is harmonic.

The fallacy of this is clear when one considers that the
planes 100, 101, 001, and ioi in the oblique system would
thus show symmetry, since they are harmonic conjugates.
Dr. Liebisch points out that the indices of the planes in a
form can be deduced from those of one of the planes when
the symmetry is given. The deduction though simple is
sufficiently difficult, and it would have been better to have
given it fully. Another omission is found in the problem of
isogonal zones, i.e. the determination of the possible angles
between planes of symmetry. The solution is carried out
so far as to show that the angles must have the squares
of the cosines rational, and then the special values are
given. No attempt is made to show that these are all
the possible cases. It is not difficult to find all the sub-
multiples of 180° which satisfy the condition, and the
complete solution has long since been worked out by
Axel Gadolin and Prof. Maskelyne.
The author is remarkably well read in the literature of
crystallography, and has done much to compress the
valuable portion of this literature into the space of a
comparatively small volume. The book is certainly not
suited as a text-book for students who are beginning
crystallography ; and its methods of solution of crystals
are not the simplest in practical work. For advanced
students, who wish to regard their subject from different

withstanding its omissions, will very greatly assist them,
both by its own statements and solutions of the problems
of crystallography, but also by its careful references to
the literature of the subject. It is well printed, and has
a large number of excellent woodcuts.

men and women there is a striking and peculiar physiognomy,
which is the same in hundreds of the sculptures; there are other
traits equally persistent, and the ornamentationof which there
is so much on the figures, tablets, and vases, is unique, and
preserves a constant relation. The uniform observance of such
characteristics in so large a number of objects, would seem to
determine them as "typical," no matter who were the makers of
them, or when they were made.
Dr. Rau believes, he says, that the "carvings" originated in
comparatively modern times. I should be pleased to have any
evidence either from colonial or other history of West North
Carolina, that might throw light upon their production, as I have
spent much valuable time in endeavouring to find such evidence.
Dr. Rau continues:"They ('the carvings') were made by
a few individuals of the Indian, or, perhaps, even of the
Caucasian race." But he has already said that they do not
"resemble the well-known specimens of modern Indian art."
How, then, does he know that ''they were made by a few indi-
viduals of the Indian race?" And I would ask why members
either of the Indian or Caucasian races have chosen to make
representations of other peoples than themselves, and with other

characteristics than their own? Why Indians, who are notori-
ously prone to war, should have, in their representations, so
carefully absented all of its indications, and emphasised the
pleasures and avocations of peace? And again, whyif the
"carvings" were made by a Caucasian, the maker has so
studiously refrained from placing any letter, sign, or symbol,
significant of his race or religion, on any of the 2000 objects?
"The rude attempts at imitating animals of the Old World,"
proceeds Dr. Rau, "are conclusive evidence that the makers
either had seen such animals, or knew at least that they
existed." Not necessarilyfor they may "be rude attempts at
imitating animals" of the New World. The mounds of the
United States indicate that an intercourse existed between dif-
ferent tribes and peoples remotely separated ; and, why could
not peoples, while trafficking to, or emigrating from extreme
points, carry with them impressions sufficiently forcible for
"rude attempts at imitating," and the peccary, the tapir, and
the llama, perhaps have been the models for the production of
some of these apparently "Old World animals?"
Dr. Rau objects to " potstone" as a material for endurance,
whereas it is found in the mounds in better state of preservation
than clay pottery. 1 le has not been made aware, perhaps, that
the element of fire has caused much more damage to these
carvings than "expusure." lie may remember that the
"carvings" were coated over with a greasy-looking sootfor

penetrate well into the surface of the stone. Nevertheless, many
of them are in a very bad condition. But if there were not
well-preserved antiquitiesand imitations alsoin an admirable
state of decrepitude, even in the museums, I conceive that there
are more important matters to be considered in connection with
these carvings than the material of which they were made.
In conclusion, it is perhaps to be regretted that Dr. Rau has
not in his communication suggested any satisfactory explanation
of the "curious stone carvings from the neighbourhood of
Mount Pisgah, and that he leaves the subject with such dubious
language as 'modern intrusion.'" Mann S. Valentine Paris, July 17

Instructions to Observers
The "Instructions issued by the International Conference on
the Transit of Venus, 1882," are recommended for general
adoption. These instructions are, in a great measure, founded
upon "Suggestions foraDraftof Instructions for the Observers,"
which the English Committee circulated for consideration in
October, 1881. But as copies of the Instructions, issued by the
International Conference, may not reach observers in the
English colonies who may be willing and able to co-operate
effectively, and as there are some additional explanations and
cautions which the English Committee consider it desirable to
give their observers, the following instructions have been issued.
It is most earnestly hoped that all observers who are able to co-
operate effectively in the observation of contacts will, whatever
el-e they may observe, observe the contacts as defined; and that
they will employ sufficient magnifying powers on their tele-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
scopes and use a field of view of moderate brightness. These are
essentials, if their observations are to be combined with the
results of the English expeditions.
1. It is most important that the apertures of the refractors
used for the observations of the contacts should be nearly equal.
The apertures of the telescopes available for the English expe-
ditions are not generally larger than six inches; and it is
therefore recommended that observers with larger apertures
should stop them down to six inches, but not reduce them below
that size. It is considered that perfect instruments of four
inches aperture may give results sufficiently comparable with
those made with the six-inch telescopes to allow all the obser-
vations to be combined in one common discussion; and it is
hoped that observations with such instruments will be made.
Observations with good instruments of smaller apertures than
four inches will be exceedingly valuable for combination with
others made with instruments of the same class, provided that
powers of 100 to 150 can be employed on them. Observations
of contact made with very low powers are useless for the objects
in view. When reflectors are used, apertures should not be
less than seven inches.

in the illumination of the apparent limb of the sun near the
point of contact" is intended to guard observers against giving
times for the contacts when there may be a suspicion only of
some slight disturbance, haze, shadow, or interference pheno-
mena. It is a point of primary importance that all the observers
shall, as far as possible, observe the same kind of contact; and
it is therefore desirable that the times recorded for contacts
should refer to some marked discontinuity in the illumination
of the sun's limb, about which there cannot be a doubt, and
which may be supposed to be recognisable by all the
observers.
(b.) If a pure geometrical contact, "contact geometrique sans
deformation," is alone seen, this is the only time which can
be given for the contact; but if haze, shadow, ligament, or
black drop is seen, then the last time, when any marked
discontinuity in the illumination of the sun's limb near the
point of contact is distinctly recognised as independent of mere
atmospheric tremor, is a time which should be recorded at
ingress; and the first time at which such a marked discontinuity
in the illumination is certain, is a time which should be recorded
at egress. But if the haze, shadow, ligament, or black drop is ever seen as dark, or nearly as dark, as the outer edge of the

planet, the time of greatest blackness, when it is last seen at
ingress, or first seen at egress, as dark or nearly as dark as
the outer edge of the planet, is also to be mo.-t carefully
recorded; this phase appears to correspond most nearly to
what is given by some observers as "contact geometrique sans
deformation," and probably differs but little from what most
observers would call "contact," if restricted to a single phase.
Near the time of contact the attention of the observer should
be directed to the parts of the sun's limb near the point of
contact. The discontinuity of the illumination of the sun's
limb near the point of contact will be recognised by the contrast
between the illumination at and on each side of the point of
contact.
(c) At ingress the contact can also be regarded as the time
"when light is about to glimmer all across the dark space
between the cusps." For so long as the sunlight has not
"glimmered" across the dark space between the cusps, there
must be "some well-marked and persistent discontinuity in the
illumination of the sun's limb near the point of contact." In
this definition the attention of the observer is directed to the
light of the cusps which is encroaching upon the "dark space"
between them, whilst in the definition adopted in these instruc-
tions his attention is directed to the disappearance of the dark
space between the cusps which is being encroached upon by the
light of the cusps. Great care is, however, required when the

contact is thus regarded, that the glimmering of the light of the
"aureole," "penumbra," or "sunlight refracted through the
atmosphere of Venus," across the dark space between the cusps
be not taken for the contact. The time thus recorded would be
earlier than the contact required by about a minute of time. On
the other hand, a time must not be given "when sunlight is dis-
tinctly recognised" between the limbs without any direct
reference to the time when the dark space between the cusps was

the minutes can be supplied with perfect certainty by calcula-
tion ; but in observations of a transit of Venus the contacts
from apparent contact to the "last appearance of any marked
"disturbance of the illumination" may, in a moderately bright
field, extend over more than a minute of time; and if any mis-
conception of the kind of contact which has been observed
should be possible from ambiguity in the description given by
the observer, then a serious error may be introduced into the
discussion of the results from the adoption of a wrong minute
and wrong kind of contact for this observation. In the use of
chronometers mistakes of ha If a minute have occasionally been
made by taking the "arrow end" instead of the "longer end"
of the seconds hand.
In all cases, therefore, such precautions should be taken to
verify the minutes and half-minutes that errors of entry can be
asserted to be impossible.

recovered if the mark should be accidentally destroyed.
21. In cases where the errors of the chronometers or clocks
and the geographical position of the observers are independently
determined, the observations upon which these determinations
rest should be given.
22. The descriptions of the contacts which correspond to the
time records should be written out by each observer, and entered
in an indelible form, before any discussion or comparison of the
observations with those made by any other observer has been
made. On no account is a written figure to be altered. On no
account is a new figure to be written upon an old one. Any
correction is to be written on another line, and attested by the
signature of the observer.
23. Copies of these observations, authenticated by the signa-
ture of the observer, with the necessary materials for the deter-
mination of clock-errors, longitudes, and latitudes, should be
forwarded by the next or following mail to the Committee at the
Royal Society, Burlington House, London. In the case of the
Government expeditions, the original documents must be placed

mittee have acknowledged the receipt of the copies and forwarded
instructions for the despatch of the originals.

useful to observers as a preparation for the slowne ;s with which
changes in the appearances piesented near the internal contacts
take place. But the exact phases presented in the real transit
cannot at present be reproduced in the models, and, unless care
is taken, model practice may do more harm than good in leading
observers to expect a definite succession of phenomena near the
internal contacts which they may be unable to recognise in the
actual transit. The complicated phenomena presented near the
internal contacts are, no doubt, chiefly due to diffractional irra-
diation ; but in the case of the models we have the sun and
Venus bounded by hard edges. The diffraction phenomena
beyond the geometrical boundary of the artificial sun, and the
interference phenomena between the limbs of the sun and Venus,
are continually changing as the disc, which represents Venus,
approaches nearer and nearer the hard edge which represents
the geometrical boundary of the sun's disc. These conditions
introduce complications into the phenomena seen with the
model which have nothing exactly corresponding to them in the
real transit; whilst, on the other hand, the presence of the
partial illumination of the atmosphere of Venus introduces
difficulties in the observation of the real transit which have

cal considerations: more or less weight must be given to
different results on other than purely mathematical
grounds; hence identical final results would not always
be arrived at by different calculators starting from the
same experimental data. Inasmuch as "the atomic
weight of each element involves the probable error of all
the other elements to which it is directly or indirectly
referred," it may happen that the probable error attach-
ing to an atomic weight determination is large, although
the experimental data are extremely accurate. Thus,
Crookes, by very accurate experiments, found the atomic
weight of thallium to be 203 642 ; but this number sup-
poses that NO'3 = 61'889; the value to be now assigned
to the atomic weight of thallium depends on the accu-
racy with which the atomic weights of oxygen and nitrogen
have been determined. The work of Crookes simply
fixes, with great accuracy, the ratio between the equiva-
lents of Tl and NC>3.
The most probable value for the atomic weight of
oxygen is found to be 15 9633 (H = 1), with a probable
error of ±'0035; any error which there maybe in this

determination is involved in the determinations of the
atomic weights of most of those elements which come
after oxygen. When the atomic weight is large, the error
thus introduced may be considerable: thus if 0 = 159633
Ur = 2384S2, but if O = 1600 Ur «» 239-03; difference
- 0-548.
Some of the weighings involved in the calculations have
been reduced to absolute standards, others are only un-
corrected weighings in air; hence an error is sometimes
introduced which cannot be eliminated.
The discovery of Dumas that silver prepared by the
method of Stas, occludes weighable quantities of oxygen,
has been already referred to; in four experiments Dumas
found that 1 kilogram of silver occluded 82, 226, 140, and
249 milligrams of oxygen respectively; the largest of
these numbers is taken by Prof. Clarke as "Dumas'
correction." The effect of applying this correction is
generally very slightly to lower the value of the atomic
weight ; the following table exhibits this effect in a few
instances:

a minimum of those risks of fire which are inherent to
every system of artificial illumination. They point out
that the chief dangers of every new application of elec-
tricity arise mainly from ignorance and inexperience on
the part of those who supply and fit up the requisite plant.
The difficulties that beset the electrical engineer are
chiefly internal and invisible, and they can only be effec-
tually guarded against by "testing" or probing with
electric currents. They depend chiefly on leakage, undue
resistance in the conductor, and bad joints, which lead to
waste of energy and the production of heat. These
defects can only be detected by measuring, by means of
special apparatus, the currents that are either ordinarily
or for the purpose of testing, passed through the circuit.
Bare or exposed conductors should always be within
visual inspection, since the accidental falling on to, or the
thoughtless placing of other conducting bodies upon such
conductors might lead to " short circuiting" or the sudden
generation of heat due to a powerful current of electricity
in conductors too small to carry it.
The Committee point out that it cannot be too strongly
urged that amongst the chief enemies to be guarded

against are the presence of moisture and the use of
"earth" as part of the circuit. Moisture leads to loss of
current and to the destruction of the conductor by electro-
lytic corrosion, and the injudicious use of "earth" as a
part of the circuit tends to magnify every other source of
difficulty and danger.
The chief element of safety is the employment of skilled
and experienced electricians to supervise the work.
The rules deal with the installation of the dynamo-
machine, the fixture of the wires, the character of the
lamps to be used, and the danger that accrues to the
person.
To secure persons from danger inside buildings, it is
essential so to arrange the conductors and fittings, that
no one can be exposed to the shocks of alternating cur-
rents exceeding 60 volts; and that there should never be
a difference of potential of more than 200 volts between
any two points in the same room.
If the difference of potential within any house exceeds
200 volts, whether the source of electricity be external or
internal, the house should be provided outside with a
"switch," so arranged that the supply of electricity can
be at once cut off.
The rules are very valuable, and should be obtained by
all those who are contemplating the use of the electric

T N the July number of the Deutsche Rundschau, Prof.
¦* Haeckel gives a further account of his stay in Ceylon,
a stay which his ardent enthusiasm and unwearied in-
dustry cannot fail to have made fruitful in results to the
scientific world. The present series of papers being
intended for magazine readers in general, is, as might
be expected, altogether popular in tone. The Professor's
researches and discoveries in support of the theory of
Evolution, are only implied, not described in detail.
His letter is written from the point of view of an intelligent
and cultivated traveller, fully alive to the novelty and
beauty of the scenes in which he found himself, and of a
naturalist anxious to make the most of his very limited
time to become familiar with the fauna and flora of that
lovely island which Buddhist poets gracefully apostro-
phise as "a pearl on the brow of India." The energetic
Professor was evidently a subject of much wonder to the
languid Anglo-Indians and lazy Singhalese, as, in his

bleeding from the thorns and prickles with which the

Euphorbia, and a multitude of other jungle plants repulse
every attack made on their impenetrable labyrinth. But
the attempt had not been made altogether in vain, for it
enabled me to gain a very fair idea of the jungle as a
whole, more especially of the magnificence of its trees
and creepers, besides introducing me to many separate
varieties of animal and vegetable life, which were of the
highest interest; here I saw the magnificent Gloriosa
superba, the poisonous climbing lily of Ceylon, with its
red and amber flowers ;. the prickly Hibiscus radiatus,
with large cup-shaped brimstone-coloured flowers, deepen-
ing to violet in the hollow; while round them fluttered
gigantic black butterflies with blood-red spots on their
tail-shaped wings, and chafers and dragon-flies flew past
with a metallic gleam. But my delight reached its
height when on this, my first attempt to penetrate a

jungle in Ceylon, I came across the two most character-
istic of its inhabitants from among the higher class of
animalsparrots and apes. A flock of green parrots
flew screeching from a lofty tree, as fhey became aware
of the gun in my hand, and at the same moment a herd
of great black apes sprang with a growling cry into the
thicket. I did not succeed in getting a shot at either
one or the other; they appeared to be too familiar with
the look of a gun. I was consoled, however, by securing
with my first shot a colossal lizard or iguana six feet long,
of a kind held in much awe by the superstitious natives
(Hydrosaurus salvator). The huge crocodile-like beast
was sunning himself on the edge of a water-tank, and
the shot hit him so precisely on the head as to kill him
at once; had it struck any less vital part he would
probably have dived into the water and disappeared;
when seized, the iguana has the power of hitting so sharp
a blow with its scaly tail as to cause a severe wound and
even sometimes a broken limb."
We regret that want of space forbids us to quote entire
Prof. Haeckel's account of a Buddhist temple built on the
wooded heights above Kaduwella, and the scene of con-
stant pilgrimages. It was constructed originally out of a
natural grotto, the back part of the temple being com-
posed of the bare rock, from which also is hewn the

Buddhist temples. Almost as invariable is the adjoining
Dagoba, a bell-shaped dome without any opening, con-
taining a relic of Gotama. The size of the dagobas varies
from that of a large church bell to the circumference of
the dome of St. Peter's at Rome. Near the Dagoba is
generally to be seen a large Bo-Ga, or sacred fig-tree
(Fieus religiosd).
"These 'Buddha-trees' with their venerable stems,
fantastic roots, and colossal crown of foliage form a pro-
minent feature in the picturesque surroundings of the
temples; their leaves, which are heart-shaped, with long
stalks, quiver like our aspens."

Botanic Garden at Peradenia will be read with interest

of individuals, to encourage scientific knowledge by placing
the means of gaining it within the reach of all. This
admirable institution was founded sixty years ago on the

''Another English botanist, Dr. Marshall Ward, was at
Peradenia at the same time as myself; he had pursued
his studies for the most part in Germany, and bore the
official title of 'Royal Cryptogamist.' He had been
sent here two years previously by the English govern-
ment to study the coffee-leaf disease which for many
years has raged with inceasing violence in the coffee-
plantations of Ceylon and has in great measure destroyed
this valuable source of revenue to the island. Dr. Ward
made many valuable observations and experiments on
the natural history of the microscopic fungus, which
contains the germ of the disease; but unforturateiy
Ae did not succeed in discovering any radical remedy
tot it. Instead, therefore, of receiving the gratitude

ratus on the principle of the wave-siren. Its mode of
operation will be best understood by reference to Fig.
5, taken by Dr. Kcenig's permission from his work,
"Quelques Experiences d'Acoustique." Upon a strong
stage about 4 feet high is mounted a series of 16 brass
disks, cut at their edges into sinusoidal wave-forms, all
fixed upon a common axis, and capable of being rotated
by a band and treadle. The wave-forms cut against the
contours of these 16 disks represent a harmonic series of
16 members of decreasing amplitude, there being just 16
times as many sinuosities on the largest as on the smallest
disk Against the edge of each of these wave-disks wind
can'be blown by a special mouth-piece in the form of a
horizontally-placed slit connected by a tube to a powerful
wind-chest mounted upon the stand of the instrument.
We have, in fact, here sixtetn simple wave-sirens of dif-
ferent pitch all combined together in such a manner that
any one of them can be used separately. When the axis
is rotated the wave-disks pass in front of the slits through
which the wind is blown, and throw the issuing streams
of air into vibration. Each wave-disk thus sets up a

perfectly simple tone. We have therefore provided in
this instrument a fundamental sound with its fifteen upper
partial tones. It is clear that any desired combination
can be made by opening the appropriate stops on the
wind chest. In order to vary at will the phase in which
these elementary tones are combined, a very ingenious
arrangement is adopted. The brass tubes which ter-
minate in the fifteen mouth-pieces are connected by
flexible caoutchouc pipes to the wind-chest. The mouth-
piece tubes are mounted upon a plate in such a way that
they can slide up and down in curved slots concentric
with the disks. By the aid of templates cut out in comb-
fashion, and screwed to a lever handle, the mouth-pieces,
or any set of them, can be displaced at will; thereby
introducing any required difference of phase. Fig. 6
shows the way in which the fifteen mouth-piece slits are
arranged with respect to the wave-disks; there being two
series along two different radii, eight corresponding to
the even members of the series, and seven to the odd
members. They are set with the slits each opposite a
summit or crest of its wave-disk, so that all the slots are
closed simultaneously. This in Kcenig's nomenclature
corresponds to a phase of \; the minimum condensations
of all the individual air-waves occurring simultaneously.
Suppose now it is desired to change the phase in which

the waves are compounded, and to make all the maximnm
condensations occur simultaneously (i.e. d = i): all that
Fjg. 4.Curves resulting from the superposition of harmonic series in various pha-es.is necessary is to move the mouth-pieces of the odd series
forward to the positions shown in Fig. 7, where all the
slits are seen to be opposite hollows of the wave-disks.
This is, of course, done by pushing up under the lower
series of tubes a comb-like template which moves each
through half its own wave-length.
The template that is used for causing the difference of
phase to become zero, is shown in Fig. 8, attached to the
lever-handle. Here the first, or fundamental slit, being
always immovable, the fourth, eighth, and twelfth slits
will not require to be moved, but the intermediate
members will require shifting by \, \, or \ of their wave-
length, according to their place in the series. When this
set of positions is attained, the condensation is increasing
simultaneously in all the sixteen waves, and reaches its
mean value in all at the same moment.
The fourth method of placing the slits, so as to produce
difference of phase = £ in the combination, is shown in

On completion of the work, this committee, on June 25,

known countries in the world. Now, however, that both England
and the United States have persuaded the Coreans to throw
open four of their ports to commerce, we hope that our ignorance

half the size of France, and its population is variously estimated
at from nine to fifteen millions. M. Elisee Reclus, in his

Like Italy, it has a mountain chain running down the centre of
the ^country, and giving off lateral valleys; as in the Apen-
nines, the gentlest slopes and most fertile valleys are in the west,
while the east is more precipitous and barren. As with Italy,
Corea has in the north-west an Alpine mass, which guards her
from intrusion there, though the mass does not really cover all
the boundary. Of the geology we know but little, though many
valuable minerals, including coal, are supposed to abound, and
the country as a whole is capable of great development with
proper guidance and suitable machinery. We trust before the
inevitable Europeanising process is complete, that accurate
information on the habits and customs, language, and ethnology
of the Coreans will be obtained.

In presence of the numerous and contradictory hypotheses as
to the former geological history of the delta of the Amu-daria,
it is obvious that no satisfactory scientific result as to the change
of beds in the basins of the Amu and Syr-daria can be arrived
at, without a thorough geological study of the different deposits
of the rivers of the great Aral depression. A first step in this
direction was made by the Amu-daria expedition; and now M.
Hedroitz publishes, in the Izvestia, a valuable paper, giving the
result of his researches in the same direction. Of course, one
year is too short a time for thoroughly exploring this «ide field;
and M. Hedroitz's researches, however safe his method, and
valuable his observations on the geological structure of alluvial
deposits of different rivers of the Aral depression, on the motion
of sand-dunes in the steppe, &c , are not yet sufficiently advanced
to bring the author to a few general conclusions from his obser-
vations. His paper contains more valuable data than ready-
made theories, and we hope that he will again return to the
Amu to continue his researches. But one of his conclusions
is worthy of notice. He does not admit that the Uzboy was a
branch of the Amu-daria, as was admitted by the first explorers
of this old bed. He supposes that there was a time (before the
tenth century) when the Amu reached the Caspian, but by means
of another bed which was situated south of the Sary-kamysh
depression, leaving here the beds of "Amu-alluvium," which
are seen in the lower parts of the Uzboy, but are missing in its

upper parts. As to the Uzboy, it was but a temporary and
irregular outflow of Lake Aral towards the Caspian, being rather
a series of salt lakes and ponds, than a true river. Its name,
Uz-boy (or " Uz-boyu," "along ponds"), would seem to confirm
this hypothesis. The geological exploration would thus again
call in question our established theories as to the former aspect
af the Aralo Caspian basin.
Hartleben, of Vienna, is issuing in parts a seventh

very slight taper, but in order that the column may not break
the bore must be so small that friction and capil'arity render
correct graduation impos-ible. Whiting (Pogg. Ann. cxvii., 656,
1862) proposed in place of that to use two tubes of different
diameters joined together with, at lower surface of mercury, an
ivory plate with a little glass bulb at ached above it. In the
horizontal barometer of Bernoulli and Cassini the longer range is
obtained by enlarging the tube at the upper level of the mercury
and replacing the cistern by a tube of fine bore bent at a right
angle. In Sir Samuel Moreland's diagonal barometer the top
part of the tube is bent more or less from the perpendicular. It
is said to have been invented by Derham, as he refers to his
"former communication about a crooked tube." The instru-
ment at South Kensington bears date 1750, and was made by
Watkins and Smith, London; that at Peel Park, Salford, is by
T. Whitehurst, Derby, 1772; there is also one in the museum
at King's College. Hicks (Prov. Plot. No. 740, 1862) proposed
to increase the range by terminating the tube at the top in a coil.
The maximum registering barometer of Traill is the same as
the diagonal, but with the addition of a short steel rod in the
tube above the mercury ; his minimum is on the same principle

as the horizontal 1 arometer, but the bottom open tube forms a
smaller angle than a right angle with the vertical tube. The
steel rod is placed in this open tube above the mercury. How-
son's (Pal. No. 1616, 1861) is on an entirely different principle,
as in it the cistern is supported by the floating power of a sealed
glass tube which is inserted in the mercurial column, and is
attached to the bottom of the cistern. This was reproduced by
Vidi (Les Mondes, iii., 25, 1S63) two years later.
As the absence of air above the mercury renders the tubes
very liable to fracture, from the bumping of the column against
the top, when barometers are carried or moved, the means of
rendering the instruments more or less portable has occupied the
attention of several. Nairne long ago overcame this difficulty
by making the lower half or two-thirds of the tube of very fine
bore. Passemente (1758) adopted the expedicnt of twisting the
middle of the tube so as to form two or three coils of a flattened
spiral. Spry (Phil. Trans, lv., 83, 1765), who unfortunately
gave no illustration, wrote, "The small bowl at the top with
beads therein, render it far less liable to break by the mercury's
ascent, the bowl giving it an immediate expanse from the column,
and the beads counteracting in force as so many springs."
Uzielli (Deut. Chan. Ges. Per. v., 1055, 1872) makes a some-
what similar proposal: "Above 8co mm. a glass valve is in-
serted in the tube, so that by inclining the tube the mercury
rises above the valve; then, on bringing the tube upright again,

the air is above the valve and the valve is sealed by mercury."
Recorders,In Fontana's arrangement the barometer tube
and short open tube are cemented into elbows at either end
of a short horizontal tube (in this there is a stopcock). A
float en the surface of the mercury in the open tube trans-
mits its motion to a small section of a horizontal cylinder
ab<_ut 700 mm. in diameter, and covered with paper. Every
hour an impression is made on this paper by a steel point moved
by a clock. Kreils used a siphon barometer, and connected the
float with the shorter arm of an unequal lever. The longer end
of the lever carried a pencil, w hich, being struck every five minutes
by a hammer moved by a clock, made a dot on a sheet of paper
fixed to a frame drawn horizontally in front of it. Negretti and
Zambra attach the float by means of cords attached to a balance
with unequal arms to a pencil fastened to a square collar. This
collar moves freely up and down a vertical rod of square cross-sec-
tion; the rod is near the vertical cylinder round which the paper is
wrapped, and the same clockwork which causes the cylinder to
revolve moves the rod (at regular intervals) so as to bring the
point of the pencil against the paper. Keith (Encyc. Metrop.
1S45) attaches the recorder to the float rigidly by means of a

balance; this rod hangs free, and is hit by a hammer, moved by
clockwork, at intervals of ten minutes.
O'Reilly's is a balance barometer, but not at all similar to the
foregoing, as the cistern is fixed to the tube, and the instrument
is inclined from the vertical, and suspended by knife edges. The
variations in the length of the mercurial column cause it to
incline more or less, the amplitude of movement showing itself
on a graduated arc by means of an index.
Cantoni employs a balance, but he has the tube fixed, and
suspends the cistern, which is a small one, from one arm of the
beam, to which is attached (underneath it) a pointer. Cecci
adopts the same principle, but traces the record on smoked
glazed paper (wound round a horizontal cylinder) by means of a
long pointer fixed over the beam. The floating barometer of
McGwire (Irish Acad. Trans, iv. 141, 1791) is a balance baro-
meter, as its weight is counterpoised, or nearly so, by the
wooden ring attached to the bottom of the tube. A very similar
instrument was patented by McNeill (Patent, No. 1733, 1861).

reservoir has a glass cover a little below its rim; this cover has
a hole in the centre rather larger than the tube which passes
through it, through this space the mercury rises and spreads
more or less over the cover. In Gloukhoff's barometer the
mercury in the cistern is forced by means of a screw to pass
through a hole, and to cover a glass ring. Then the movable
scale is lowered so as to make the steel end touch the surface of
the mercury. Amagat proposed to adjust the level in the cistern
by means of an iron or glass cylinder which was forced down by
a screw. Poleni (1740) adjusted the level by the immersion of
a screw. Austin (Roy. Irish Acad. Trans, iv., 99, I79i)kept
the level of the mercury in the cistern constant by overflow
from an aperture in the side into a bag underneath. Hamilton
(Roy. Irish Acad. Trans, v., 95, 1792) fitted his barometer
with an ivory cistern, the upper part of which was closed
by a cork ring; this being porous allowed air to pass
through, but retained the mercury. The cistern which is most
used is that of Fortin; it is a short, wide, glass cylinder which is
fixed by three pillars, the ends of which have screws passing through an upper and a lower brass plate, by means of which the
necessary pressure can be applied to make it mercury-tight. At
the bottom of the cistern is a leather bag, which is raised or
lowered by an adjusting screw, so that the surface of the mercury
may be brought into contact with an ivory point which forms
the zero of the scale ; this point is seen through the glass cistern.
The cistern of Green's barometer, which is used by the United

States Signal Service, is essentially the same as Fortin's.
Negretti and Zambia (Patent, No. 238, 1861) patented the
following. The cistern is screwed at the upper part to fittings
near the bottom of the tube, so that by turning it round it will
be raised until a cushion or pad placed at the bottom of the
cistern is brought up against the open end of the tube. Alver-
gnat {Rev. Hebd. d. Chim. March 1870) proposed a very elemen-
tary form on the same principle. Paul de Lamanon (" Obser-
vations sur la Physique," xix., 3, 1782) in order to determine to
what extent the expansion of the mercury influenced the height
of the column, marked a zero point on the shorter limb of a
siphon barometer. Gay-Lussac {Ann. de Chim.'i., 113, 1816),
who pointed out that, by having the tube of the same diameter
at both surfaces of the mercury, correction for capillarity was
unnecessary, also made his barometer portable by sealing the top
of the shorter limb with the exception of a very fine hole.
At the same time he made the lower portion of the longer
tube and the bend of tube of sufficiently small diameter
to keep the mercurial column from breaking. Bunten in-

lobed and laciniated, the margins either undulated, entire, or
jagged. The species also vary in the thinness or thickness of
the frond. The colour is always greenish, passing sometimes
from yellowish to white, and, in one species, is quite dark.
In the young state the frond always adheres to some object,
such as stones, rocks, or other algae, but in most species it
becomes detached, and lies at the bottom of the sea.
As to the internal structure of the frond, it is, on the whole,
very thin, and the principal part is formed of a single layer of
cells, which lie in the same plane. It is provided with a more
or less abundant intercellular substance, and is held together by
a cuticle, which incloses the whole frond.
The lower part of the frond, when attached to some object,
has a more compound structure. The celLs, as regards their
form, situation, and other particulars, are more developed. In
mature specimens of all the species yet examined, except M.
bullosum, they are often of a lengthened club-shaped form, and
lie with their thickened ends side by side, while the smaller ends
wind about each other, and sometimes almost interlace. The

than the upper. In some cases other cells, resembling those in
the upper part of the frond, are mixed with the club-shaped
cells. From a transverse section of this part of the frond it
would appear to be formed of two or even three layers of cells,
of which only one is single, namely, that which is formed of the
thickened ends of the cells; the other consists of their thin ends
and of smaller cells. Somewhat different arrangements of the
cells of the lower part of the frond are noticed in the description
of species.
It is, therefore, the upper part of the frond only which is
monostromatic. The cells in this part vary in form; some are
rounded and have rather prominent angles, others are angular,
with the angles sometimes rounded off, but occasionally quite
sharp. Their longest axis is sometimes at right angles with the
surface, at others it is horizontal. As to the position of the cells
with regard to each other, in some species this is irregular, with-
out any special order; in others the cells are grouped with more
regularity two and two, three and three, or four and four
together. They are separated more or less by the intercellular
substance. The species which give the best examples of this
kind of grouping are M. bullosum, M. laccratum, and M.
quaternarium.
The substantial part of the frond consists of an inclosing mem-
brane and its contents. The membrane, which is a true cellu-

lose membrane, is, in mature examples, of most of the species
very thin, and quite hyaline, therefore very difficult to detect.
The most important part of the cell contents are the chlorophyll-
bodies which are coloured by chlorophyll. In some species
they fill the cells entirely and naturally take their form; in
others they fill only half or even a less portion of the cells, and
lie like a band across the cells parallel to the surface of the
frond.
Within the chlorophyll-bodies are found abundantly round
grains of starch; except for these the contents of the upper part
of the fronds are tolerably homogeneous.
No nucleus (cellulkarna) has as yet been observed with cer-
tainty. In the monostromatic parts of At. Grevillci there are
often seen, about the centre of the cells, almost circular light
spots which remind one of a nucleus, but of which the nature
has not yet been ascertained. The cells of which the lower part
of the frond is composed have already been noticed; it is only
necessary to add that the cells here are never so close together
as in the upper part of the frond, and that the interstices are filled with small portions of the intercellular substance.
The chlorophyll-bodies in the club-shaped cells never fill the
entire space, but keep strictly to the form of the cells, and long

NATURE
zoospores in motion have a power of contracting and expanding
very quickly, and of very considerably changing their form; this
changing of form, he considers, constitutes in itself the mechanism
of motion. In this essay he has clearly proved that in the alga;
then under examination, the cilia cannot be the true organs of
motion.
The zoospores originate always in the cells that lie on or near
the margin of the frond; they afterwards appear in abundance
in the upper parts of the frond, whence they spread gradually
downwards, till they fill up all the cells of the monostromatic
part.
When the motion finally ceases, the zoospores fasten them-
selves to some object near at hand, and then begin to develop
into young plants. The zoospores which, till this time, were
formed of the bare protoplasm only, are now covered with a
cellular membrane. The cilia disappear, and a process of
division commences, which, however, in the species of this genus,
has not been studied. In several other well-known Ulvee, this
division takes place first in one dimensk-n, but afterwards in
two; thus an expanded membrane is formed. This increase in
size takes place, according to the observations of authors,
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:10 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
principally, but not exclusively, in the periphery of the frond,
or on the apex, if there be one. The youngest parts of the
plants are thus always at the top, and the oldest at the base. In
this way the frond acquires a tolerable leaf-like aspect.
As before-mentioned, the frond does not in all the species
remain attached during its whole life to some object. It is
often found, fresh and in full vigour, lying loosely at the bottom
of the water in which it grew. Thus, according to the
experience of authors, these free examples are entirely monostromatic. Hence there is reason for the opinion that, in this
case, the frond divides itself into two parts, and that the division-
line between them falls just on the border between the upper
monostromatic part of the frond and the lower, and not mono-
stromatic. The upper part of the frond survives for a consider-
able time, and generally increases in size, until the formation of
zoospores begins, when it gradually decays. The fate of the
other part of the frond is involved in obscurity. Dr. Wittrock
thinks it not improbable that the cells may detach themselves
from each other, and become a kind of fixed gonidia, which
finally develop into young plants. Such a mode of increasing
would agree with that which, according to Kiitzing, occurs in
several species of the genus Ulva of authors (Phycoseris, Ktz.),
where the cells in the stipes of the plants, after the frond
becomes free, put forth budding-cells. It also occurs in
Prasiola.
Kiitzing, in his works, speaks of another kind of reproductive

bodies, the so-called Spermatid, which he says occur in the
Ulvacecc. He describes them as brown, and as detached from
the surface of the frond, also as round bodies with a thick hya-
line membrane, the contents of which are brown and granular.
In Ulva latissima, Ktz., to judge from the figure, they appear
to be about three times as long as the outer cells. Dr. Wittrock
had been unable, after diligent search, to find them. To Thuret
their use was unknown, and lessen supposed that they proceeded
from some accidental deformity of the common cellular tissue.
No genus in the whole vegetable kingdom has so wide a range
as Monostroma. It has representatives in all parts of the world,
but the greater part of the species prevail in the colder parts of
the European temperate zone. Of the eighteen species which
are known with tolerable certainty to belong to the genus twelve
are found in this zone. In the southern part of the Polar regions
the genus has not less than seven representatives; in the equa-
torial zone one species is found; south of the range of the
"wild goat," only two. In Europe there are fifteen species; in
Asia, two (or, including M. fuscum, three); in Africa, one; in
North America, one; in South America, one; and in Australia,
three species.1

THE MODERN APPLICATIONS OF
ELECTRICITY
The Modern Applications of Electricity. By E. Hos-
pitaller. Translated and Enlarged by Julius Maier,
Ph.D. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, and Co., 1882.) THIS book professes to be a popular account of all the
more important practical applications of electricity
that have during the last five years drawn so much public
attention to that science. No better popular book than
that of M. Hospitalier has appeared, and were it not for
certain defects, chiefly of style, the present translation
by Dr. Julius Maier would have been admirable. It
deals in a fairly easy and at the same time fairly accurate
manner with many technical matters, and will no doubt
prove a very popular work. Part I. treats of the sources
of electricitybatteries and dynamo-electric machines.
Part II., which is naturally the largest section of the
work, is devoted to Electric Lighting. Part III., the
least satisfactory perhaps of the whole, and the one that
has suffered most by the fact of being a translation of a
foreign work, comprises Telephones and Microphones.
In the fourth and last section a number of miscellaneous

applications are described, including Electric Motors.
We have referred above to certain defects of style
apparent in the work before us. It is unusual, to say the
least, to speak of the "blades" of a battery in referring
to the plates of metal or electrodes. Still less usual is it
to call the electrode-poles "rheophores"; a term which
probably a great many electricians in this country have
never used and do not know of. Neither is it usual to
speak of a steam-engine as a "vapor-motor." There are
objections against the novel use made by the author or
his translator of the term "electrodynamic" as a general
adjective to comprise both "magneto-electric " and "dy-
namo-electric" machines. The word "electrodynamic"
has already its own accepted use in the science ; and if
any extension of that use is necessary, all analogy requires
that that extension should be in a direction different from
that attempted. It is a dangerous experiment in a
"popular" book to meddle with accepted technical terms;
for besides being misleading to the public when they sub-
sequently attempt to read other and more strictly scien-
tific books, it makes the author of the popular work look
as if he did not understand what he was writing a' out,
when he uses accepted terms in a meaning other than
their accepted one. There are other points that strike
one as defects. What will the ordinary reader make out
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of such a sentence as that with which Chapter I. opens?
"We can form a fairly exact idea of a battery by com-
paring it to a focus (sic) of heat; for instance, the furnace
of a boiler." Or this (p. 14): "To continue our com-
parison between a battery, the focus of electricity and a
focus of heat, we say that polarisation in a battery is
analogous to the want of draught in a chimney?' This
precious piece of nonsense is nearly equalled by the fol-
lowing: "The battery is only used now in law courts, in
national assemblies, and by some experimenters who for
some reason or other cannot set up a steam or gas
motor." (These italics are ours.) But worse than these mild absurdities there are a few

positive errors which no reviewer can conscientiously
pass over. There is so much that is excellent in M.
Hospitalier's work, that it might seem ungracious to point
them out. But the only way to keep up the standard of
popular scientific works is to point out where their scien-
tific sins lie. In a section devoted to electrical units, we
are first told that the "unit of intensity" is the ampere.

Lastly, we must protest against the treatment given to
Reis's Telephone, of which the book declares that it
"has always remained a purely musical apparatus." It
is perfectly clear that neither M. Hospitalier nor Dr.
Maier can have read Reis's own papers when they make
this assertion, which those papers amply refute, and which
a careful trial of Reis's own instruments will also amply
contradict. Reis invented his instrument, taking the
human ear as pattern, because the human ear can vibrate
to all kind of sounds. He invented it, meaning it to
transmit speech, and though it transmitted music better
than speechand both imperfectlyit did, to a certain
degree, fulfil its inventor's aim. The author seems in
fact to have viewed Reis's invention through the hazy
medium of the writings of Count du Moncel, or some
less reliable authority; for he mentions Yeates's experi-
ments of 1865 (in which articulate speech was transmitted
by a modified Reis instrument with such accuracy that
the voices of individual speakers were recognised), and
then adds: "The musical telephone might have become
an articulating telephone under these conditions, but this

result was not obtained, partly on account of the imper-
fection of the instrument, and partly because Yeates had
no such result in view.'" How this extraordinary dis-
tortion of well-known facts has crept into the book before
us we are at a loss to conjecture. Doubtless the numerous
excellent illustrations with which the book is adorned
will procure for it a ready sale.

AS a mere handbook this work is indispensable to the
European traveller in Japan. But it is much more
than a handbook, it not only indicates what is sight-
worthy, but explains by illustrative myth or legend, drawn
from local tradition or from the little explored treasures of
Japanese literature, the special interest with which moun-
tains, temples, mounds, groves, and places are invested
in the eyes of such Japanese as have not yet aban-
doned their nationality. To readers of this journal the
most valuable portion of the book will be the description

as accurate as minute of the Alpine region formed by the
provinces of Etchiu and Hida (now the prefectures of
Ishikawa and Gifu)a region difficult of access even to
natives, and almost untrodden by Europeans. The
mountain range bounding this wild and remote tract on
the East is the most considerable in Japan, extending
nearly due north and south for some sixty or seventy miles,
and rugged with innumerable peaks, the most conspi-
cuous of which, beginning from the north, are Tateyama,
9500 feet, Goroku-dakd, 9100 feet, Yari-ga-take", 10,000
feet, and Norikura, 9800 feet. The chain is not of homo-
geneous structure, nor are the peaks of contemporaneous
origin. The basis is a closegrained granite, not unfre-
quently rich in garnets. Through this backbone or axis
vast masses of igneous and volcanic rock have been ex-
truded, the volcanic rock principally trachytic, often
coarse-grained, and occasionally (Tate-yama) columnar.
Of the peaks, Yari-ga-take" (spear-peak) seems the most

no-watashibasket-crossingis much used in these pro-
vinces. A sort of wicker cradle is suspended on hempen
ropes slung across the valley, and is drawn by lines
to one side or the other, or, as is more usually the case,
the peasant crosses without assistance. Entering the
cradle, he seizes the ropes above with his hands, and by
a series of dexterous jerks, needing considerable practice
for their due accomplishment, takes himself and the cage
across. The great danger seems to be that of getting the
cradle from under him, and thus leaving his body
suspended in mid-air. His struggles are represented no
less quaintly than vigorously in a drawing by Hokusai, to

of boiling lava, spurted up from time to time in the man-
ner described by Miss Bird in her graphic description of
the great volcanic districts of Kilauea and Mauna Loa.
It is not mentioned that the two wells on the summit, on
the edge almost of the crater itself, the Famous Golden
Water and the Famous Silver Water, derive their supply
from hoards ol snow preserved by overlying masses of
wind-heaped scoriae, and volcanic dust from perishing
under the fiery rays of the summer sun. One of the
most interesting of the many peaks which Messrs. Satow
and Hawes are the only Europeans who have as-
cended, is Mount Ganjiu, of which the shapely out-
lines rise in beautiful logarithmic curves high over the
plains of Nambu. The mountain consists of three
volcanic cone-frusta "telescoped" into each other. The
lower cone is of course the oldest, the rim of its crater
being still distinct at a height of about 5001 feet. A
smaller cone about 600 feet high, rises within this, the
rim of the crater of which is nearly equally distinct, and
a third and smallest cone tops all, having a height of not
more than 100 feet, and showing a crater at its summit,
from which jets of steam still issue.
It is noteworthy that in Japan the names of rivers,
capes, plains, and villages are usually pure Japanese, those

place names in the northern part of the main island have
a distinctly Aino character, for instance, such a name as
Namakunai, and many of the names ending in "be-," a
corruption of "betsu," the Aino word for river.
Two capital maps accompany the book, which the
stay-at-home reader will find as full of curious lore as the

This book is the result of notes and observations other

there are numerous and valuable contributions by Mr. J.
R. Dakyns, M.A., Cantab, (of H. M. Geological Survey),
both in the foot-notes and in the text.
Notwithstanding this, however, the book is an original

in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Yorkshire, in which
the customs, manners, and folk-speech differ very little
from that of Nidderdale, we think the volume deserves a
much wider circulation than in the district of that valley
from which it takes its name. Six of the concluding
chapters are devoted to the birds of Nidderdale. These
chapters on natural history are the most pleasing in the
book, and contain information respecting the distribution
of many birds which is altogether new. After these there

Probably the most valuable, and certainly the most
laborious portion of the work, is the glossary of the
dialects of Nidderdale, with which it concludes.
Local glossaries no doubt there are without number, of
the northern dialects, but we have never before seen one
which has traced with such clearness, both from its use
and derivation, each word to its source. A residence of
over forty years in some of those remote regions in which
a corresponding dialect is spoken, enables us to testify
that Mr. Lucas has been wonderfully accurate and ex-
haustive in laying hold of the vocables of the district;
and the pains and skill with which he has traced them
through the Norse and other cognate languages, must be
seen before they can be properly understood. T. E.

The Sun-spot Period
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
The sight ol my bile noire, that part of Wolf's sun-spot curve
lying between the years 1766 and 1799, so clearly plotted in the
communication by Prof. Stanley Jevons, on "The Solar-Com-
mercial Cycle" (Nature, vol. xxvi. pp. 226-28), impels me to
offer some remarks having special reference to solar periodicity
at that time.
In a paper read at the meeting of the British Association in
York last year, 1 ascribed the sun-spots to planetary tides in the
solar atmosphere. It is not pretended that what was advanced
amounted to demonstration, but the assumption had this prac-
tical resultit led me to the conclusion that the sun-spot maxima
and minima, recognised in what is known as the sun-spot period,
are, on the whole, determined by the relative positions of the
planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter. The maxima are nearly
always associated with configurations in which Venus and Earth
in conjunction or opposition, have Jupiter in or near syzygy
or quadrature; while the minima are even more certainly asso-
ciated with configurations in which Venus and Earth in conjunc-
tion or opposition, have Jupiter in or near the octant.
There are, however, significant deviations from this general
law, and the maximum to which Wolf assigns the date 1788'!

i'i the biological laboratory at South Kensington, and, after a
diligent attendance at Prof. Huxley's eighty odd lectures, and at
the five months' practical work, he succeeded in passing the
examination in the second class. The two following years Mr.
McAlpine, with laudable perseverance, again presented himself
for examination, each time appearing a place or two lower in
the second class.
While working at South Kensington Mr. McAlpine made
several copies of the diagrams of type dissections in the labora-
tory, which diagrams are for the most part enlargements of my
original drawings made by my friend and former colleague, Mr.
G. B. Howes. I naturally imagined that Mr. McAlpine, like
nther students who had taken the same trouble, intended to use
these copies either for his private work or for his classes in
Edinburgh, and I was, therefore, greatly surprised at the appear-
ance of the Biological Atlas, to find in it a number of marvel-
lously inaccurate copies of these same diagrams, published not
only without permission, but without the slighte-t reference to
their source even in the preface.
In the Zoological Atlas (Vertcbrata) the same thing occurs,
and my diagrams, although strangely altered, are quite recogni-

sable; in the figure of the skate's nervous sy>tem, for instance,
I notice, copied with unusual accuracy, a mistake as to the origin
of the orbito-nasal nerve, which occurred in my original drawing,
but which has subsequently been corrected.
In the cases where Mr. McAlpine, having no diagrams to
copy, has had to depend upon his oun dissections and the state-
ments in text-books, the results are sometimes remarkable. As
an instance, I may take the ingenious diagram of the skate's
vascular system, in which paired caudal veins are shown accom-
panying the caudal artery, and passing directly into the corre-
sponding cardinal veins, the renal portal systems being com-
pletely suppressed.
According to the advert i-ements, the Athcmrum recommends
the "Biological Atlas" to all students of the subject; I regret
that 1 cannot agree with y<nr contemporary; in my opinion no
books could possibly be more mischievous to a beginner than
these, since they hold up for his example and imitation a work
of the most inaccurate and slovenly description; as indeed, if
p >ssessed of ordinary powers of observation, he cannot fail to
find out for himself before he has been a month at the subject.

river gravel and brick earth near the West Drayton Station of
the Great Western Railway. I had an opportunity of going to
West Drayton on July 27, 1880, so I walked through the cutting
towards Langley. My quest was for relics of primaeval man, and
I was rewarded by finding not only several flint flakes, but the
butt end of a massive implement broken in Palaeolithic times.
This was just north of Langley Station, in Buckinghamshire, and
the first Palaeolithic relics, as far as I know, detected in that
county. The workmen in the cutting for the new canal were
such a rough lot that I found it impossible to fraternise with
them, so my subsequent visits were all made on Sundays. During
these walks I lighted on ten implements and a large number of
flakes at Langley and Iver, all in the valley of the Coin, and a
river until now (as far as I know) not described as implementi-
ferous. In gravel brought from the pit close to Taplow Station I
found a single implement, a large trimmed flake, and numerous
simple flakes; this position is also in the county of Buckingham.
At West Drayton, in Middlesex, in the valley of the Coin, I

INTERNATIONAL POLAR OBSERVATORIES
ON August 1, it is hoped, that a ring of observing
stations will begin work all round the pole. By this
time all the expeditions that have been arranged for will
either be on the way or on the spot. The readers of
Nature are doubtless familiar with the inception and
progress of a scheme for Polar research which originated
in 1875 with the late Lieut. Weyprecht, and has been
gradually built up until it has assumed the proportions of
a great international effort to obtain accurate scientific
observations on the physical and biological conditions of
the polar area. Our Map of the Arctic Regions will en-
able the reader to note the localities of the various
stations, and the nationality of the observing parties in
each case. Meantime it may be useful to give a brief
history of the scheme, and a sketch of the programme
which it is proposed to carry out. This we are enabled
to do from the official documents issued by the Inter-
national Polar Commission.
As we have already said, it was in 1875, at tne forty-
eighth meeting of the Association of German Naturalists
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:10 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
and Physicists at Gratz that Lieut. Carl Weyprecht ex-
plained his views as to the proper basis for Arctic explo-
rations. He showed that while the Polar regions un-
doubtedly offer one of the most important fields of
investigation for all branches of natural science, this is
especially the case with reference to inquiries into the
physical condition of the earth. The numerous and
costly expeditions which have hitherto been organised
have, however, yielded comparatively insignificant returns,
so that it may almost be said that they have merely
contributed to show more clearly how important it would
be for all branches of natural knowledge to have those
regions explored in a thoroughly scientific way. The
scientific results of Polar voyages hitherto have been very
scanty, and have borne no proportion to the expenditure
of money and labour involved in the expeditions. Wey-
precht ascribes this principally to the circumstance that
in these Polar voyages geographical discovery was always
made the chief object, while scientific investigations were
considered to be of secondary importance. He points out
also the isolated character of the individual voyages, and
consequently of the scientific observations taken during
their continuance. The observations are therefore de-
ficient in a qualification which is of great importance in
Polar regions, viz. the possibility of a comparison with
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
simultaneous observations at a number of other places.
Lieut. Weyprecht therefore proposed to deviate from the
principles which have hitherto ruled Polar explorations,
by abandoning geographical discovery and particularly
reaching the Pole, as the main object, and instead aiming
at scientific observations, especially those of a physical
character. He proposed that, instead of isolated voyages
in the Polar regions, expeditions should be sent out,
organised on a common plan, in order to take simul-
taneous physical observations, for a considerable space
of time, at several different points around the Pole.
In conjunction with Count Wilczek, Lieut. Weyprecht
drew out a programme for Polar research of this type
which was submitted to the International Meteorological
Congress, held at Rome in the spring of 1879. The
Congress, when this programme was submitted to it,
recognised the great importance of Weyprecht's proposals,
and recommended it for adoption to all governments.
Owing, however, to the fact that all the individual dele-
gates to the Congress had not received definite instruc-

b. Times of Observation
2. The hourly magnetical and meteorological observations
may be made according to any time, only the magnetical
observations on the term days must always be made according to
Gottirgen time (mean civil time). The term days are always
the 1st and 15th of every month, except January, where the 2nd
is to be taken as the term day instead of the 1st.
c. Order of the Observations
3. The expeditions are free to choose the order of their
observations as they think fit.
d. Mtteorological Observations
4. Air. Temperature. The mercurial thermometers should
be read to o"'l C, the spirit thermometers to at least o°$ C.
5. The thermometers should be verified at the Central Meteo-
rological Office-;, and the spit it thermometers besides are to be
compared with a mercurial thermometer at the place of observa-
tion at as low temperature as possible. The zero point of all
thermometers used in the observations is to be determined afresh
from time to time.
6. The thermometers are to be placed at a height of at least
IJ to 2 metres above the ground, in a screen like that given by

with the free circulation of the air about them they will be shel-
tered from all disturbing influences of radiation.
7. The minimum thermometer for the determination of air
temperature must be placed under the same conditions as the
other thermometers.
8. The temperature of the sea on the surface and at the depth
of every 10 metres is to be observed wherever possible. The
following are suggested as useful instruments for this purpose :
sluggish thermometers by Eckmann, Negretti and Zambra,
Miller-Casella, &c.
9. Pressure. Every station must at least have a standard
mercurial barometer and a goid observing mercurial-barometer,
besides reserve barometers and aneroids.
10. The barometers mu-t be verified by a Central Meteoro-
logical Office, and the observing barometer must be compared at
least every week once with standard barometer.
11. Humidity. The psyche-meter and the hair hygrometer
are to be used, but at lo.v temperatures they must be compared
as often as possible with instruments for direct observation.
12. Wind. The vane and Robinson's anemometer should be
arranged to be read off inside the observ.vtoiy (vide the arrange-
ment of the Swedish instruments at Spitzbergen). The direction
of the wind is to be given for every 16 points and according to
true bearings. Its velocity should always be given according to

Robinson's anemometer, and also estimated Beaufort's scale. As
a reserve instrument for measuring the wind force, in case of
injury to Robinson's anemometer, Hagemann's anemometer
recommended itself as being simple in management and very
strong.
13. Clouds. Form, amount, and direction of motion at
various heights, are to be observed to 16 points.
14. Rainfall, &c. Occurrence and duration of rain, snow
Graupel (soft hail) are to be noted, and when possible the
amount.
15. Weather. Thunderstorms, hail, fog, hoar-frost, and
optical phenomena are also to be noted.

16. In determination of absolute declination and inclination
the accuracy of one minute is to be aimed at, and in those of the
absolute horizonial intensity accuracy of 0,001 of its value.
17. It is decidedly necessary, besides the absolute observations
in the observatory itself, to make a series of measurements in its
neighbourhood, in order to prove the existence of possible local
influences.

draw up instructions for an expedition, or themselves to take
part in one.
29. Meteorology. The variation of temperature with height;
the temperature of the soil, the snow, and the ice on the surface
and at various depths; solar radiation; evaporation at all
seasons. The melting of ice in the summer.
30. Terrestrtal magnetism. Occasional absolutely simul-
taneous readings of all three magnetical instruments, so as
to determine accurately the relation between the simultaneous
variations of horizontal and vertical intensity.
31. Galvanic earth currents. Observations of earth-currents
in close connection with magnetic observations and those of
auroral phenomena.
32. Hydrographical observations. Observations on currents,
on the thickness, structure, and motion of ice, soundings and
observations on the physical properties of sea-water, e.g. deter-
minations of its temperature and specific gravity. Tidal obser-
vations if possible by means of automatic apparatus.

33. Aurora. Measurements of the height of the aurora by
two observers stationed about 5 kilometres (3 miles) apart in
the line of the magnetic meridianspectroscopical observations.
34. Observations on atmospheric electricity; on astronomical
and terrestrial refraction; on twilight; on the length of the
second's pendulum; on the growth and structure of floating ice
and of glaciers. The collection of samples of air for analysis.
Observations and collections in the departments of zoology,
botany, geology, &c.
III. The Reductions and Calculations at the Place
of Observation
35. The rules adopted by the Congresses of Vienna and
Rome are to be followed in all calculations and reductions of
meteorological observations.
36. As regards the discussions of magnetic observations the
adoption of the metrical units of Gauss is recommended. From
the variation observations, the declination, and the horizontal
and vertical components of the intensity are to be deduced.
IV.Publication of the Observations
37. Summaries of the observations are to be sent to the
International Polar Commis ion, as soon as possible after the
return of the expedition, so as to be published speedily and
in a uniform manner. It is desirable, if possible, to send even
earlier notices of the fate and general progress of the expedi-
tion.

38. All observations are to be published in exlenso when
their discussion is complete. The International Polar Com-
mission will therefore be reassembled for a fresh Conference, to
learn the amount of information which has been obtained, and
to come to an agreement as to the best mode of its publication.
39. In this publication the Metric scale will be used, and all
temperatures expressed on the centigrade scale.
Nothing could be more complete and satisfactory than
this programme, and from the results when reduced and
carefully compared, valuable data may be expected as to
the physics of the Arctic regions. We trust nothing
will occur to mar the success and continuity of the
observations, and that they will ba such as to encourage
their continuance, for we fear that a single year's
observations cannot be regarded as furnishing any-
thing like sufficient data to warrant perfectly trustworthy
conclusions. The Commission very wisely decided that
it would be advisable to obtain series of observations at
existing observatories outside the Arctic Area, but as far
as possible in the northern hemisphere. To their Circular

rapidly the means of transit is being developed, and of
accommodation multiplied, it is evident that for some
years to come this popularity will continue to grow.
These great advantages and attractiveness are due to
physical configuration and climate.
As regards climate, the two points to be specially con-
sidered are the rainfall and temperature. Of these the
most varied, and apparently the most capricious, is the
rainfall, which alone imparts to the Highlands very great
diversity in its climates.
An annual rainfall of forty inches may be taken as the
limit separating the dry climates of the East from the
wet climates of the West Highlands. If a line be drawn
from Perth to Cape Wrath, all parts of Scotland to the
east of it have, roughly speaking, a rainfall not exceeding
forty inches, whereas to westward of that line the annual
rainfall exceeds that amount. Hence the Eastern Gram-
pians, the Highlands between the Don and Moray Firth,
and the Highlands of Eastern Perth, Eastern Inverness,
Eastern Ross, Eastern Sutherland, and Caithness are
characterised by climates which are comparatively dry,

and therefore bracing.
A glance at the map will show that the whole of the
Scottish Highlands is, with respect to the west-south-west
winds, entirely unprotected by Ireland, and completely
exposed to these vapour-laden winds of the Atlantic.
Over the whole of Scotland to the south of the Forth
and Clyde, which may be regarded as under the lee of
Ireland, the average rainfall at no station exceeds 66
inches, with the single exception of Ettrick Pen Top,
2268 feet high, at which fourteen years' observations
gave an annual average of 71 inches.
On the other hand, the Highlands to the north of the
Clyde are fully open to the west-south-west winds of the
Atlantic, and there accordingly the late summer and
autumnal rains set in early and with great copiousness.
Over an extensive tract resting, as it were, on a base line
stretching from Dunoon to Balquhidder, and extending
north-westward to beyond Dunvegan, in Sk\e, the annual
rainfall is at least 80 inches. In this extensive region the
heaviest rainfalls, and therefore wettest climates are met
with in situations either inclosed among mountains of
rugged grandeur, such as the districts about Lochs Coruisk, Hourn, and Shiel, or up and over such plateaux
as that whence rise the Tay, Leven, Orchy, Aray, and
Falloch. The spot of largest rainfall in Scotland, so far
as known, is near the head of Glencroe, situated between
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Lochs Fyne and Long, the mean annual amount there
being 128 inches. Surrounding in a somewhat irregular
manner this wet district, and stretching northward along
the watershed, as far as Loch Assynt, is another region
of twice the extent over which the rainfall is from 60 to
80 inches. Again, on the east of this region, and between
it and the line marking an annual rainfall of 40 inches, is
an extensive tract stretching as far as Cape Wrath, which
has a rainfall from 40 to 60 inches annually, and the
same rainfall is found in Western Sutherland, a large
portion of Western Ross, the whole of the Hebrides, and
all islands to the south, the surfaces of which rise to no
great height above the sea.
Reference has been made to the shelter afforded by
Ireland in imparting a drier climate to places situated to
the east-north-east of it The same principle is seen in
the influence of Skye and the Hebrides in bringing about
the comparatively dry climate of Western Ross and
Sutherland, the rainfall of which is from 15 to 20 inches
less annually than in similar situations south of Skye, but
unprotected from the rain-bringing winds of the Atlantic.

the same end without producing flame.
Amongst these may be mentioned in this place :
1. Improvements in wedging processes. A long iron
wedge, placed in a previously drilled bore-hole between
two strips of iron with flat faces and convex backs, is

3. The caustic lime process, which forms the principal
subject of the present note.
Although the proposal to employ caustic lime in this
manner is not quite new, its first successful application
has been made by Messrs. Smith and Moore, at Shipley
Collieries in Derbyshire, where, thanks to the courtesy of
these gentlemen, we lately saw it in operation under the
superintendence of one of them. The seam of coal which
is known as the Derbyshire Deep Hard, consists of three
beds in immediate contact with each other. The top bed
one foot thickis of inferior quality, and is left for a
roof arid permanently lost. The middle bed2 feet 10
inches thickproduces good marketable coal in large
blocks, and constitutes the object of working. The
bottom bed7 inches thicktogether with a bed of soft
shale 10 inches thick, serves as a holing. The method of
working is longwallthe faces being straight, and each
about 100 yards long. The holing is carried in to a depth
of about 3^ or 4 feet under the roal ; and while it is being
done, the front of the mass which it is intended to detach
is supported upon short timber props {sprags) placed at
distances of six feet apart.
After the holing is completed a series of horizontal holes
three inches in diameter are drilled close to the roof to a
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
depth of three feet or so. These holes are also about six
feet apart. Seven cylindrical blocks of caustic lime, each
2^ inches in diameter by 4^ inches long are placed in
each hole. They are prepared by grinding burnt lime to
a powder, and then compressing it into blocks of the
required shape and dimensions under a hydraulic press.
They are, naturally, kept and carried in airtight boxes.
There is a groove in each block parallel with its axis, and
large enough to receive a pipe | inch in diameter. The
grooves are kept uppermost in the bore-hole. An iron
pipe i inch in diameter, a few inches longer than the
length of the hole, provided with a stop-cock at its outer
end, and with a cloth bag drawn over its inner end, is
inserted into the groove of the first block and then forms
a guide for the others. Outside the last block the hole
is firmly tamped first with paper, and then with rubbish.
After all the holes have been charged, a quantity of
water, said to be equal in bulk to that of the caustic lime
already occupying the hole, is forced into each in succes-
sion through the iron pipe. This is done by means of a

the reasons for this belief. For if the petals were origin-
ally a row of altered stamens set apart for the special
function of attracting insects, it would be natural and ob-
vious why they should begin by being yellow; but if they
were originally a set of leaves, which became thinner and
more brightly coloured for the same purpose, it would be
difficult to see why they should first have assumed any
one colour rather than another.
The accepted doctrine as to the nature of petals is that

discovered by Wolf and subsequently rediscovered by
Goethe, who held that all the parts of the flower were
really modified leaves, and that a gradual transition could
be traced between them, from the ordinary leaf, through
the stem-leaf and the bract, to the sepal, the petal, the
stamen, and the carpel. Now, if we look at most
modern flowers, such a transition can undoubtedly be ob-
served; and sometimes it is very delicately graduated, so

that you can hardly say where each sort of leaf merges
into the next. But, unfortunately for the truth of the
theory as ordinarily understood, we now know that in the
earliest flowers there were no petals or sepals, but that
primitive flowering plants had simply leaves on the one
hand, and stimens and ovules on the other. The oldest
types of flowers at present surviving, are certain gymno-
sperms, such as the C)cads, of which the well-known

Zatnias of our conservatories may be regarded as good
examples. These have only naked ovules on the one
hand, and clusters of stamens in a sort of cone on the
other. The gymnosperms are geologically earlier than
any other flowering plants. But, if petals and sepals are
later in origin than stamens and carpels, we can hardly
say that they mark the transition from one form to the
other, any more than we can say that Gothic architecture
marks the transition from the Egyptian style to the
classical Greek. It is not denied, indeed, that the stamen
and the ovary are themselves by origin modified leaves
that part of the Wolfian theory is absolutely irrefutable
but with the light shed upon the subject by the modern
doctrine of evolution, we can no longer regard petals and
sepals as intermediate stages between the two. The
earliest flowering plants had true leaves on the one hand.

and specialised pollen-bearing or ovule-bearing leaves on
the other hand, which latter are what in their developed
forms we call stamens and carpels; but they certainly had
no petals at all, and the petals of modern flowers have
been produced at some later period.
All stamens show a great tendency easily to become
petaloid, that is to say, to flatten out their filament, and
finally to lose their anthers. In the waterlilies wc can

trace a regular gradation from the perfect stamen to the per-
fect petal. Take for example our common English white
Nymphaa alba (Fig. 1). In the centre of the flower we find
stamens of the ordinary sort, with rounded filaments, and
long yellow anthers ; then, as we move outward, we find
the filaments growing flatter and broader, and the anthers less and less perfect; next we find a few stamens which
look exactly like petals, only that they have two abortive

transition was not in the opposite direction? How do we
know that the waterlily had not petals alone to start with,
.ind that these did not afterwards develop, as the Wolfian
hypothesis would have us believe, into stamens?" For
a very simple reason. The theory of Wolf and Goethe is
quite incompatible with the doctrine of development, at
least if accepted as a historical explanation (which Wolf
and Goethe of course never meant it to be). Flowers can

and do exist without petals, which are no essential part of
the organism, but a mere set of attractive coloured ad-
vertisements for alluring insects; but no flower can pos-
sibly exist without stamens, which are one of the two
essential reproductive organs in the plant.
Indeed, if we examine closely the waterlily petals, it is
really quite impossible to conceive of the transition as
taking place from petals to stamens, instead of from sta-
mens to petals. It is quite easy to understand how the

less; but it is very difficult to understand how or why a
petal should first begin to develop an abortive anther,
and then a partially effective anther, and at last a perfect
stamen. The one change is comprehensible and reason-
able, the other change is meaningless and absurd.
In many other cases besides the waterlily, we know
that stamens often turn into petals. Thus the numerous
coloured rays of the Mcsembryanthemnms are acknow-
ledged by many botanists to be flattened stamens. In
Canna, where one anther-cell is abortive, the filament of
the solitary stamen becomes petaloid. In the ginger
order, one outer whorl of stamens resembles the tubular

instead of six. In orchids, according to Mr. Darwin, the

outer whorl. In double roses (Fig. 2) and almost all other
double flowers the extra petals are produced from the sta-
mens of the interior. In short, stamens generally can be

liacece, Malvacea, and Rosacea, all very simple types.
Looking at the question as a whole, we can see how
petals might easily have taken their origin from stamens,

302
[July 27, i8t<2
NA TURE
while it is difficult to understand how they could have
taken their origin from ordinary leavesa process of
which, if it ever took place, no hint now remains to us.
In a few rare instances, petals even now show a slight
tendency to revert to the condition of fertile stamens. In
Monandra fislulosa the lower lip is sometimes prolonged
into a filament bearing an anther: and the petals of shep-
herd's-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) have been observed
antheriferous.
But if the carlie-t petals were derived from flattened
stamens, it would naturally follow that they would be for
the most part yellow in colour, like the stamens from
which they took their origin. How, then, did some of
them afterwards come to be white, orange, red, purple,
lilac, or blue?
The different hues assumed by petals are all, as it were,
laid up beforehand in the tissues of the plant, ready to be
brought out at a moment's notice. And all flowers, as
we know, easily sport a little in colour. But the question
is, do their changes tend to follow any regular and definite
order? Is there any reason to believe that the modifica-

tion runs from any one colour towards any other? Appa-
rently, there is. All flowers, it would seem, were in their
earliest form yellow; then some of them became white;
after that, a few of them grew to be red or purple; and,
finally, a comparatively small number acquired various
shades of lilac, mauve, violet, or blue.
Some hints of a progressive law in the direction of a
colour-change from yellow to blue are sometimes afforded
us even by the successive stages of a single flower. For
example, one of our common little English forget-me-
nots, Myosotis versicolor, is pale yellow when it first
opens; but as it grows older, it becomes faintly pinkish,
and ends by being blue like the others of its race. Now,
this sort of colour-change is by no means uncommon;
and in almost all known cases it is always in the same
direction, from yellow or white, through pink, orange, or
red, to purple or blue. Thus, one of the wall-flowers,
Cheiranthus chamcrleo, has at first a whitish flower, then
a citron-yellow, and finally emerges into red or violet.
The petals of Stylidium fruticosum are pale yellow to
begin with, and afterwards become light rose-coloured.
An evening primrose, CEnothera tctraplera, has white
flowers in its first stage, and red ones at a later period of
development. Cobaa scandens goes from white to violet;
Hibiscus mutabilis from white through flesh-colou red, to red.

The common Virginia stock of our gardens (Afa/colmia)
often opens of a pale yellowish green; then becomes
faintly pink; afterwards deepens into bright red; and
fades away at last into mauve or blue. Fritz Miiller noticed in South America a Lantana, which is yellow on
its first day, orange on the second, and purple on the
third. The whole family of Poraginacccc begin by being
pink, and end by being blue. In all these and many
other cases the general direction of the changes is the
same. They are usually set down as due to vary ing de-
grees of oxidation in the pigmentary matter.
If this be so, there is a good reason why bees should
be specially fond of blue, and why blue flowers should
be specially adapted for fertilisation by their aid. For
bees and butterflies are the most highly adapted of all
insects to honey-seeking and flower-feeding. They have
themselves on their side undergone the largest amount of
specialisation for that particular function. And if the
more specialised and modified flowers, which gradually
fitted their forms and the position of their honey-glands
to the forms of the bees or butterflies, showed a natural
tendency to pass from yellow through pink and red to

dog-rose, Rosa canina, R. villosa, R. rubiginosa, &c),
which in some still bigger exotic species become crimson
ot damask of the deepest dye. They are more sought
after by insects than any others of their family.
Now, if we look closely at these facts we see that they
have several interesting implications. The yellow poten-
tillas have the very simplest arrangement of the carpels
in the whole family, and their fruit is of the most primi-
tive character, consisting only of little dry separate nuts.
They have altered very little from their primitive type.
Accordingly almost all the genus is yellow; a very few
members only are white; and these in their habits so far
vary from the rest that they have very erect flowers, and
three leaflets instead of five or more to each leaf. One of
them, the strawberry, shows still further marks of special
differentiation, in that it has acquired a softi pulpy, red
fruit, produced by the swelling of the receptacle, and
adapted to a safer mode of dispersal by the aid of
birds. This group, however, including Geum, cannot
claim to be considered the earliest ancestral form of the
roses, because of its double calyx, which is not shared by

other members of the family, as it would be if it had
belonged to the actual common ancestor. In that respect,
agrimony more nearly represents the primitive form,
though its tall habit and large spikes of flowers show that
it also has undergone a good deal of modification. Never-
theless, the yellow members of the potentilla group, in their
low creeping habit, their want of woodiness, and their
simple fruit, certainly remain very nearly at the primitive
ancestral stage, and may be regarded as very early types
of flowers indeed. It is only among handsome and showy
exotic forms which have undergone a good deal more
modification, that we get brilliant red-flowered species
like the East Indian P. nepalensis and P. atropurpurea.
But as soon as the plants rise a little in the scale, and
the flowers grow larger, we get a general tendency towards
white and pink blossoms. Thus the Pruucahavc diverged
from the central stock of the rose family in one direction,
and the Pomea and Rosea in another; but both alike
begin at once to assume white petals; and as they lay
themselves out more and more distinctly for insect aid,
the white passes gradually into pink and rose colour. To
trace the gradations throughout, we see that the Rubea
or brambles are for the most part woody shrubs instead
of being mere green herb?, and they have almost all
whitish blossoms instead of yellow ones ; but their carpels
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
still remain quite distinct, and they seldom rise to the
third stage of pinkiness; when they do, it is generally
just as they are fading, and we may lay it down as a
common principle that the fading colours of less developed
petals often answer to the normal colours of more deve-
loped. In the Pninea, again, the development has gone
much further, for here most of the species are trees or
hard shrub-, and the number of carpels is reduced to one.
They have a succulent fruita drupe, the highest type
and though the flower contains two ovules, the ripe plum
has only one seed, the other having become abortive. All
these are marks of high evolution: indeed, in most
respects the Prunea stand at the very head of the rose
family, but the petals are seldom very expanded, and so,
though they are usually deeply tinged with pink in the
cherry (Prunus cerasus), and still more so in larger exotic
blossoms, like the almond, the peach, and the nectarine,
they seldom reach the stage of red. Our own sloe (P. communis) has smallish white fl jwers, as has also the
Portugal laurel {P. lusitanicus). In these plants, in fact,
higher development has not largely taken the direction of
increased attraction for insect fertilisers; it has mainly

long, bow-shaped spurs, each of which secretes a drop of
honey (Fig. 9). The carpels are also reduced to five, the
regularity of number being itself a common mark of
advance in organisation. Various columbines accord-
ingly range from red to purple, and dark blue. Our
English species, A. vulgaris, is blue or dull purple, though
it readily reverts to white or red in cultivated varieties.
Even the columbine, however, though so highly special-
ised, is not bilaterally but circularly symmetrical. This
last and highest mode of adaptation to insect visits is found
in larkspur (Delphinium a/acis), and still more developed
in the curious monkshood (Aconitum napellus), Fig. 10.
Now larkspur is usually blue, though white or red blos-
soms sometimes occur by reversion; while monkshood is
one of the deepest blue flowers we possess. Both show
very high marks of special adaptation; for besides their
bilateral form, Delphinium has the number of carpels
reduced to one, the calyx coloured and deeply spurred,
and three of the petals abortive; while Aconitum has
the carpels reduced to three and partially united into a
compound ovary, the upper sepals altered into a curious

coloured hood or helmet, and the petals considerbly
modified. All these very complex arrangements are
definitely correlated with the visits of insects, for the two
highly abnormal petals under the helmet of the monks-
hood (Fig. 1 r) produce honey, as do also the two long
petals within the spur of the larkspur. Both flowers are also
specially adapted to the very highest class of insect visitors.
Aconitum is chiefly fertilised by bees; and Sir John
Lubbock observes that "Anthophora pilipes and Bombus
hortorum are the only two North European insects which
have a proboscis long enough to reach to the end of the
spur of Delphinium elatum. A. pilipes, however, is a
spring insect, and has already disappeared, before the
Delphinium comes into flower, so that it appears to
depend for its fertilisation entirely on Bombus hortorum."

FREDERIC KASTNER, who is known to the scien-

recently died, as we announced at the time, at the early age
of thirty years. He was the son of an Alsacian composer
of some merit, Georges Kastner, and was himself an ac-
complished musician. Educated partly at Paris and partly
at Strasburg, he imbibed a love of science, and at the early
age of fourteen years was already assisting his teachers in

the chemical laboratory. When seventeen years of age he
invented and patented a novel form of electromotor, in
which a series of electro-magnets were caused to act in
succession upon a rotating arbor. After the war of
1870-71, in which he was driven from Strasburg, he de-
voted himself to studying the properties of musical
flames. The discovery of Higgins in 1777, that a hydro-
gen flame burning within the lower end of an open glass
tube could set up a musical note, had been the starting
point of a number of hitherto barren attempts by Schaff-
gotsch and others. Without knowing anything of the
experiments of Schaffgotsch, Barrett, or Tyndall, young
Kastner set to work to experiment, with the deter-
mination to construct a musical instrument on this
principle. For two years he worked at the sub-
ject, endeavouring to temper the harsh tones of the
flames and to produce a purity and constancy in their
notes. He tried tubes of different sizes and forms. He
varied the form of the gas jet, and essayed to introduce
two or more jets into one tube. At last, in 1871, he dis-
covered that when he employed two flames he could

in the way of geographical exploration, it does not con-

We can only express, for the present, the deep regret with
which we learn the death of Prof. F. M. Balfour, a regret
which »c are sure wilt be shared by all who know anything of
Mr. Balfour's career. The details to hand of the accident which
led to Mr. Balfour's death are meagre. The news reached Cam-
bridge on Sunday evening that he had been killed by a fall on
the Alps. From later information it would seem that both Mr.
Balfour and his guide met with their deaths on the glacier of
Fresney, on the south side of Mont Blanc, about five miles west
of the village of Courmayeur. The bodies have both been found.
Mr. Balfour was only thirty-one years of a*e.
Mr. George P. Marsh, the venerable American Minister at
Rome, whose death, at the age of eighty-one years, has just been
announced, was known as the author of the interesting work 0:1
"The Earth as Modified by Human Action," reviewed in

The German Association of Naturalists and physicians meets

able association. The Association, however, will really begin its
work on the Sunday evening (September 17) by a "Zusammen-

Few cities report no teaching; and this circular is an attempt to
catch the present aspect of affairs, and to assist and guide them.
The supply of science students from the training colleges is
increasing fast, and the number of teachers able to give labora-
tory instruction will soon be equal to the demand. The teaching
at some of the older colleges, where the accustomed routine of a
classical education cannot be dropped, is among the least satis-

nastics and training equal to "Euclid's Elements and the Latin
Grammar," always insisting upon the importance of experiment
with didactic instruction. In a great majority of case", never-

else than mischievous cram, our report advises that it be left out
in primary and intermediate schools. Far better so, *han a long

learning language from a grammar, only without attempting to
translate or write exercises." It is specially urged, therefore,

results of such teaching, even to the youngest learners, are
shown in very interesting cases quoted; and the same principle
is followed in recommending that apparatus should be extempo-
risedthis also by the pupils especially. "It will be invaluable
to the future teacher; it vastly increases his power to interest
and instruct his pupils, and at the same time it deepens his own
insight into the subjects taught" The value of physical and
chemical knowledge to medical men, the inadequate training of
many of whom in America we recently noticed, to naval officers,

any such appeal to practical motives is hardly necessary in
America, for the complaint is also made that applied science is
most in demand, while pure science and research are too

comet-seekers in Australia, and with this object has addressed a
circular to several persons in the colonies, who have manifested
an interest in the science. We wish Mr. Tcbbutt every success:
the matter could not be in better hands. It would be easy to
adduce numerous cases where the theories of these bodies have
suffered from the want of southern observations, and it may be
hoped, that in conjunction with the systematic search undertaken
by a number of observers in America, and, we are glad to add,
i 1 this country also, it will be quite an exceptional case for a
comet within range of ordinary telescopes to escape detection,
as we know many have done in past years. The additions to
the number of comets of short period during the last fifteen years,
are alone a sufficient inducement to institute more systematic
examination of the heavens in future.
PHYSICAL NOTES
AN organ-pipe sonometer is described in the American Jour-
nal of Science, by Mr. I.e Conte Stevens. The ordinary reson-
ance box of the sonometer is in this instance replaced by a double
organ-pipe of spruce fir-wood, tuned to give the note C = 132
vibrations. Three steel wires are stretched above, two being
tuned to the fundamental, the other strained to various degrees
of tension by a lever and a sliding weight. There are also
arrangements for sharpening or flattening the note of one of the
pipes at will, so as to produce beats. By varying the wind-
pressure, the natural harmonics of the pipes can be produced.

The object of the instrument is to afford a convenient means of
producing the notes of the natural scale and those of the tem-
pered scale, by way of contrasting them with one another. The
apparatus has several other uses as a lecture instrument in
acoustics.
M. Cailletet has invented a new pump for compressing
gases to a high degree of compression. The main point in its
construction is the method by which he obviates the existence of
useless space between the end of the piston-plunger and the
valve, which closes the end of the cylinder. This he accom-
plishes by inverting the cylinder and covering the end of the
plunger with a considerable quantity of mercury. This liquid
piston can of course adapt itself to all the inequalities of form of
the interior space, and sweeps up every portion of the gas, and
presses it up a conical passage into the valve. The valve by
which the air enters the body of the pump is opened by a cam-
gearing after the descent of the piston below point where the
air rushes in.
Another suggestion due to M. Cailletet is worthy of notice, and is applicable to many pieces of laboratory apparatus beside air-pumps. It is the employment of vaseline as a lubricant wherever there is a liability of the presence of mercury; for, as
noun, most oils and fatty matters clog with finely-divided
] are objectionable on this account.

formed in a tube to which the heat of a Bunsen burner was
admitted (through a rock-salt plate); and the resultant variations
of pressure were recorded by means of a Knoll pantograph.
The curve obtained (with percentages as abscissa; and indicated
pressures recorded as ordinate-) shows, as one might expect, a
decrease of rise of pressure through absorption of heat, with
decrease of CO.., but the two are not proportional. With regular
decrease of CO., from 100 per cent., the fall is slight, in the
curve, to about 5 per cent., and thereafter rapid to zero with
pure air. (Mixtures of CO and II gave a different curve, with
a much lower position throughout.) By chemical methods the
CO; has been shown to vary between 002 and C05 per cent.
Hence it was desirable to develop the corresponding part of the
curve just described with special care. This was done, and
atmospheric air, freed from moisture, bat not from C02, was
admitted to the apparatus. The tabulated results of fifty analyses
made thus, in four days, at Giessen, appear to prove the appli-
cability of the method. (The proportion of CO., varied between
o'02O and C034.) Its advantages are: only small quantities of
air (one or two litres) bein^ required, and the operations being
quite simple, and taking little time (say half an hour). It is

suggested that the aqueous vapour in air may be similarly
measured.
A THIRD instalment of researches on transpiration of vapours,
by Ilerr Steudel, at the instance of Prof. Lothir Meyer, is
described in Wied. Ann. No. 7; it relates to alcohols and their
halogen derivatives, and to some substitution-products of ethane and methane. In a concluding paper Prof. Meyer reviews the
inquiry. The supposition is confirmed, that homologous series,
even with very different molecular w eight, have for the most part
nearly the same constants of friction. (All compounds contain-
ing one carbon atom show strong divergence.) The influence of
the nature of the contained atoms, on friction, is remarkable.
Thus, with about equal molecular weight, iodine produces a
much greater friction than bromine, and the latter a greater than
chlorine. Far-reaching conclusions as to the form of molecules,
Prof. Meyer is not prepared to draw, but the cross section of the
molecule of a tertiary butylic compound is inferred to be less
than that of the corresponding secondary, and the latter less than
that of the primary. This agrees with received views as to the
linking of these compounds. The molecular volumes reckoned
from the friction of vapours, stand to each other in nearly the
same ratios as the molecular volumes in the liquid state at
boiling point.
From observations made several years ago, Prof, von Keusch of Tubingen was led to think the hydrophane of Czernowitza
a substance peculiarly well fitted for diffusion experiments with
gases. Its properties in this relation have now been carefully
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
studied by Ilerr Ilufner (IVied. Ann. No. 6); and inter alia, it
is shown that the resistance to passage of a number of gases is
related both to the coefficients of absorption and the specific
gravities; all three increasing in the same sense (but not in
simple proportion).
An interesting analogy to thermoelectric phenomena, 4c, is
given by M. Bouty in the Journal de Physique (June). Suppose
a tubular ring, impermeable to heat, containing in its lower half
sand saturated with water, and in its upper air saturated with
water-vapour. If heat be applied at one end (A) of the sand, a
circulation is set up, the water being vaporised at A, condensed
at the opposite end B, and filtering through the sand to replace
the water evaporated at A. Again, suppose (instead of heat)
a rotary pump acting about-the middle of the air space; a circu-
lation is produced, and the water evaporating at A causes a fall
of temperature, while the condensation at B causes a rise; an
image is thus presented of Peltier's phenomenon. The junction
A, which is cooled, is precisely the one which must be heated to
produce the existing circulation, and the quantity of heat absorbed
at A is proportional to the weight of water evaporated per second,
that is, to the intensity of the current.

The current number of the British Quarterly Review contains
an article on recent Japanese progress, which is by far the most
valuable that has been published on this subject for many years
past. The author, Col. H. S. Palmer, R.E., describes fully
the cau-es and course of the changes which have passed over the
"Land of the Rising Sun" in the past fourteen years; the
vari 'lis and complicated changes in the constitution and adminis-
trationfrom the pure oligarchy which succeeded the revolution
of 1868, to the system of tolerably free local government of the
present dayare clearly explained, and the effect of the various
steps in these changes made comprehensible to the general
reader. The writer then takes the recent reforms under various
headsthe army, navy, education, public works, prisons, &c
and shows, by statistics, what advance has really been made.
The last half of the paper is, in fact, a comprehensive sum-
mary, with running commentary, of the Japanese government
statistics in every department. The knotty subject of finance is
treated with as much clearness as the subject admits of. Under
this head the almost inevitable character of the present financial
depression is explained; but it is gratifying to notice that a
careful and impartial observer like Col. Palmer is able to con-

CONTRIBUTION OF ASTRONOMY TO THE
PROBLEM OF MOLECULAR PHYSICS1
"TTIE kind way in which you have received me, leads me to
fix, by writing, the principal points of our conversation on
Sunday last. I thank you heartily for offered help to realise the
scientific aim I have in view, and which I will now explain.
The synthetic study of thermo-chemical phenomena, of the
laws of tbermo-dynamics and of experiments relating to these
subjects of the physical sciences, has brought us to consider the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
temperature of a body as being the mean amplitude of the
vibratory oscillation of molecules constituting that body.
This definition, taken as a starting point, enables us to explain
and deduce all the essential laws of the mechanical theory of
heat. We obtain from it easily the law of Dnlong and Petit,
that of isomorphism in systems of crystallisation, the relations
connecting the coefficients of expansion of all substances with
their atomic weight, their temperature of fusion and their
density, &c.
The maximum tensions are calculated in advance with all
exactness, and lastly, the two great mechanical principles of heat
are an immediate and necessary consequence of it.
I have, then, every reason to believe that this definition will
be adopted, since it satisfies as well the condition of integrability
of the differential equation of motion (function S of Zeuner) as
the definition drawn from the air or mercury thermometer
(definition of Regnault).
In that case, what is the specific heat of a body?
The specific heat becomes the sole manifestation of the
attraction of molecules for one another.
Indeed, if we n.ultiply the space traversed (temperature) by

the ether, whose density is function of the velocity of propaga-
tion of light and heat, as also of the wave-lengths.
Multiplying all these masses by the square of the velocity of
each particle relatively to the centre of gravity of the solar
system, we obtain the factor JMz/2 = the total kinetic energy of
the solar system.
This constant kinetic energy (if the second hypothesis be
admitted, in which fj m v* is constant) is not distributed through-
out the solar system in a regular and fixed manner. Sometimes
a planet, as Jupiter, is at the extremity of the larger axis of his
ellipse, and advances more slowly; sometimes, on the contrary,
his velocity is accelerated and passes through a maximum to
another position of his orbit.
At the same minute all the planets are revolving round the
sun, some with their maximum velocity, others with their mini-
mum velocity, others, agair, with intermediate velocities. We
may make addition of all these kinetic energies of the whole
solar system, and differentiate the total equation with reference
to time. The variations thus obtaineri for each hour will
naturally eliminate all the quantities of constant kinetic energy
represented by the rotati' n of the stars on their own axes; they
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:10 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
will merely show the increase or the diminution of the whole of
the variable kinetic energies of the system.
One may easily draw a curve of these variations calculated by
the ephemerides of the principal planets. Jupiter will play a
preponderating rdle in this calculation.
Considering still the second hypothesis, in which the attraction
is merely the result of shocks, it is evident that the attraction
manifested by each planet for the bodies which are on its surface
will be the echo of the kinetic energy disposable on this planet.
This kinetic energy will be variable according to the day and hour
of observation.
In fact, the kinetic energy of the solar system being fixed and
constant, if the planets, on a certain day, absorb inlo their own
mass a maximum quantity of kinetic energy, the cause of gravity
on the earth will be diminished by the whole of the excess which
is accumulated in these bodies in motion, and the acceleration g
will pass through a minimum. On the other hand, when, a few
years later, the whole of the planets give a minimum total of
kinetic energy for their masses in motion, the value of g, for the
same reasons, must pass through a maximum.
It is easily understood that the value of the terrestrial attrac-
tion cannot remain con tant if the disposable kinetic energy
varies in function of the time and of the respective position of
the other planets.
Now, we may calculate the total mass M of the system, the
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
partial masses and their variable velocities; we obtain for these
variations considerable values; then if we register carefully the
values of g obtained directly during observations which must
continue at the least several years, and if we trace a curve of the
values of g so obtained, we should find the following
coincidence:
The curve of variations of the total kinetic energy of the planets
must be inverse to the curve of values of g referred to the :ame
time.
The differences between the maxima and the minima of the
two curves, taken on the same ordinate, will give the measure of
the velocty of propagation of the kinetic energy in the ether of
the solar system.
These conclusions are rigorous in the case of the hypothesis,
J mv1 = constant,
being in accordance with nature.
In the case, on the other hand, of attraction being an essential
property of matter, and of our having
J mv1 + the potential = constant,
we should find forjf a constant, since g is the sole manifestation
of a constant potential, supposing the mass of the earth is

The idea of measuring variations of gravity at different points of the globe by the height of the mercury column which balances the pressure of a given mass of gas at constant temperature, M. Mascart has sought to realise, and he finds the method capable of great precision. He uses a kind of siphon-barometer with the short branch closed and holding
CO,, introduced at a pressure sufficient to balance a mercury column of I m., when the tube is vertical. The instrument is placed in a metallic cylinder filled with water, which is agitated by an air-current, and contains a thermometer measuring TJ- deg.
The divided scale is fixed on the tube; one sees it by reflection on a gilt surface, which sends the virtual image into the axis of the tube, and the mercury is seen through the gold layer. Thus one can see, with a single microscope, the mercury-level and the
C3rres[>oiiding division of the scale. M. Boussingault recalled having used a similar apparatus during his stay at Ecuador, near the mines of Marrnato (l,6com. alt.)

FRANCIS MAITLAND BALFOUR
DEATH has been striking heavy blows at Cambridge.
Only a little while ago we were mourning the loss of
Maxwell, taken from us, as it seemed, in his prime, when
we were fondly hoping that for many years yet to come,
the bounds of science would continue to be widened by
the labours of his powerful mind ; and now Balfour has
been snatched from us in the very flush of youth, with his
work only just begun, for what he had achieved, great as
it was, seemed to his friends only an earnest of that which
was yet to come.
The editor of Nature has asked me to write a few
words about my lost friend; and I obey, feeling it my
duty not to refuse, painful as the task is.
Francis Maitland Balfour was born in 1851 or 1852 (I
cannot at this moment find out which), and was therefore,
at the time of his death, only about thirty years of age.
After spending some years at Harrow, where he gained
the reputation of being a bright, clever boy, but raised
no adequate expectations of what he was about to become,
he entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October,

1870. He had the good fortune to become at once the
private pupil of Mr. Marlborough Pryor, who had just been
elected the first Natural Science Fellow at Trinity, and
though Balfour had already turned towards natural
science, and indeed had gone pretty fully into the geo-
logy of his native county (Haddingtonshire), I cannot but
think that the direction of his studies, and so of his
future career, was largely determined by Pryor's admir-
able influence. I myself was called to Trinity College as
Prcelector at the same time that Balfour entered, and I
believe he, in his second term, attended the lectures
which I was then giving; but I did not distinctly make
his acquaintance till March, 1871, when I took part in an
examination at Trinity College, which resulted in Balfour
being elected Natural Science Scholar. From that time
onward we became more and more intimate, and I took
an increasing share in the direction of his studies.
Discovering very early how great his powers of mind
were, and learning that his private resources were such
as to enable him to disregard the pecuniary advantages of
academic success, I did, what seemed to some at the
time, a rash thing: I counselled him to neglect the ordi-
nary routine preparation for his degree, and to apply
himself at once to original work. His mind from the first
was drawn towards morphology rather than towards physi-

ology; and, as I was then attempting to embody in a
small volume some of the lectures on embryology which I
had given in London and Cambridge, I proposed to him
that he should associate himself with me in the work, and
undertake at once the investigation of some of the many
embryological problems which lay to hand. He did so,
and the results of these, his early labours, are partly con-
tained in the papers "On the Layers of the Blastoderm,"
"On the Primitive Streak," and "On the Development
of the Blood-vessels,'' published in the Quarterly Journal
of Microscopical Science, July, 1873, and are partly scat-
tered and hidden in the little work "On the Development
of the Chick," which bears his name and mine. The
larger achievements of his succeeding years have of

course overshadowed these works of his 'prentice hand;
but while he was engaged on them, that power of acute
observation, rapid grasp of the meaning of things, and
strict faithfulness of statement, which all have since
recognised in him, became evident to myself at least.

logy, at first in conjunction with Mr., now Prof. Milnes
Marshall, but after two terms, by himself. From that
time up to last Christmas his labours were enormous,
and his energy untiring. His class grew rapidly in
numbers; he had to separate the students into an ele-
mentary and advanced division, each with separate
lectures, and courses of practical instruction; and
though he soon gained the able assistance of Mr.
Adam Sedgwick and others as demonstrators, all his
pupils enjoyed the priceless advantages of close personal
contact with himself. At the same time he carried on,
either by himself, or through his pupils, a large number
of independent investigations into various problems of
embryology and morphology, and set himself to write
that great work on "Comparative Embryology," every
page, and indeed every line of which is marked at once
by the widest knowledge and the clearest insight, and
which will tell men in long years to come how great is
our loss to day. And all the while he was most active in
university and college matters; every syndicate almost

was desirous to secure his services, and in the framing of
the new statutes of Trinity College he took among the
junior fellows a prominent part.
During all these exertions his friends, and I not less
than any of them, watched him with anxious care. But
he was wise as well as zealous, and never went too far;
and when, the second volume of the big book being off
his hands, he started last Christmas for a holiday to
Messina, the prospects of his health seemed to me better
than ever. On his journey outward, he found one of his
pupils who had gone to study at Naples laid up with
typhoid fever at Capri, and with characteristic kind-
ness he halted to nurse the patient till friends could
arrive from England. On his return home, he himself
was struck down by an attack of the same fever, which
at first threatened to be severe, but happily proved other-
wise, and speedily left him; and soon after there came
an event which was to him one of the greatest pleasures
of his short life.
His fame was now spreading rapidly wherever science
reaches, and honours were coming thick upon him. In
1878 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and in
1881 was not only placed on the Council, but received the
high distinction of a Royal Medal. In the same year the
University of Glasgow conferred on him the degree of

LL. U., the British Association, at the York meeting,
chose him as one of the General Secretaries, in December
last a brilliant company assembled at Cambridge to greet
him as President of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,
and while he was on his sick bed, the Committee of the
Atheiueuin elected him, as a distinguished man of science,
a Member of that Club. Moreover, other Universities
were eager, if possible, to win him for themselves. I
believe it is no secret that many efforts were made to
induce him to become the successor at Oxford of the
lamented Rolleston; and it is certainly no secret that the
Government again and again pressed him to take the
chair of Natural History at Edinburgh. He, however,
remained faithful to his Alma Mater, and though, owing
to difficulties arising out of impending changes, his merit,
in spite of the esteem and pride with which all men at
Cambridge regarded him, remained without adequate re-
cognition in his own University, he chose to remain with
us, waiting till the future should bring him his dues.

solar constant) had been under-estimated by the methods
of previous observers, and that conclusions of importance
connected with the temperature of the planet remained
to be drawn, it became desirable to verify these results,
obtained near the sea-level, by direct simultaneous obser-
vations at the base and summit of a very high mountain.
The generosity of a citizen of Pittsburg had provided
the special apparatus devised for the new methods, but
this was too elaborate to be easily moved to a distant and
elevated station. Upon the bearing of the contemplated
observations on practical problems of meteorology be-
coming known to Gen. W. B. Hazen, the Head of the
U.S. Signal Service, he kindly offered to facilitate the
transportation of an expedition from the Alleghany Ob-
servatory to the Western Territories; for no wholly
suitable site presented itself, save in regions where the
aid of the army might be desirable both for transporta-
tion and escort.
With the consent of the trustees of this Observatory,
the offer was gladly accepted, and the expedition, which,
as originally planned, was a private one, proceeded with

material aid from the Signal Service; and under the
advantage of Gen. Hazen's official direction 1 am enabled,
by his kind permission, to here briefly indicate its main
objects and results, in advance of a full publication of
them, which will shortly be made.
The site selected, on the suggestion of Mr. Clarence
King, and after conference with officers of the Army and
Coast Survey familiar with the western wilderness, as
suited to the special observations (which made both great
altitude and great dryness desirable), was Mount Whitney
in the Sierra Nevada of Southern California. It rises to
nearly the height of Mont Blanc from one of the most
arid regions in the world, and so abruptly, that two
stations can be found within easy signalling distance,
whose difference of elevation is over 11,000 feet. It is,
however, on the other side of the continent, in an imper-
fectly explored region, and as very little was known of the
possibility of carrying such apparatus as ours to the
summit, a military escort was provided, on the con-
tingency of our being obliged to occupy some site still
more remote from civilisation.
The scientific members of the party, consisting of Capt.
O. E. Michaelis, of the Ordnance, of Messrs. J. E. Keeler
and W. C. Day, civilian assistants, and the writer, started
from Pittsburg on July 7, for a railroad journey of over

3000 miles, which was greatly facilitated by the courtesy
of Mr. F. Thomson, of the Pennsylvania Company, which
enabled the writer to take all the apparatus with him in a
special car. At San Francisco, after some delay, which
the kindness of General M'Dowell, commanding the de-
partment of the Pacific, enabled us to pass agreeably,
the escort was provided, and the party joined by Mr.
George Davidson- and two Signal Service non-commis-
sioned officers. With these it proceeded to a point about
400 miles further south (Caliente), where we exchanged
the swift motion and the comforts of the Pullman car, for
the sharp contrast of a route which commenced (with the
shade thermometer registering no° F.) by a slow journey
across the Inyo Desert, shadeless and waterless, for one
hundred and twenty miles. We reached, at the close of
the month, Lone Pine at the foot of the Sierras, where a
camp was made, to be occupied as a lower station, and
where the instruments were set up. Among these was a
massive siderostat, sending a horizontal beam to a specially
constructed spectrometer, an instrument larger than the
one which usually bears the name, and in which the eye

could not be asserted (as it has been of cases at like
altitudes in the Alps), that reflection from the snow had
anything to do with the ^tate of our very literally " burned''
faces.
In view of the lateness of the season it was decided to
make the permanent camp at an altitude of rather less
than 13,000 feet, rather than wait and make a road to the
peak, which rose 2000 feet above us, and was daily climbed
for observations with portable instruments.
The sky was perpetually fine, of a deeper violet than I
have observed elsewhere, even on Etna, and the dryness
extreme, though water from the snow-fields above was
abundant. An equatorial telescope of 5A inches aperture,
which was kindly loaned by Prof. E. C. Pickering, it was
found too late could not be well used to determine the
quantity of the "seeing," owing to a maladjustment of
the eye-pieces, which it was necessary to hold in the
hand. Under these circumstances a critical estimate of
the definition under high powers could not be made, but
enough was seen to make it evident that it was generally

excellent, and that such a site possessed advantages for
an astronomical, as well as for a meteorological station.
It is greatly to be desired that it should be occupied,
with the protection of a permanent building, adapted to
either object, and it is probable that such provision will
be hereafter made.
For us, however, there was no other shelter than our
tents, and the high wind, the cold, and the mountain
sickness consequent on the rarefied air, made the con-
tinuous observations which were kept up synchronously
with that at the camp at Lone Pine, a matter of difficulty.
These observations were persistently maintained, how-
ever, but we were not sorry on September 11 to break up
our wintry camp and to descend to summer again. We
resumed our journey across the desert, and then across
the continent, reaching Pittsburgh on September 28, 1881.
The reductions of the observations are still incomplete,
but some conclusions of interest may already be indi-
cated.
It has been said that the determination of the amount
of heat the sun sends the earth is the fundamental
problem of meteorology, since on this all the phenomena
which that science contemplates depend. Accordingly
the observations were directed first to this primary object,
chiefly through methods which involved the study of the
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
phenomena of selective absorption (so intimately con-
nected with it), and secondarily to these phenomena
considered in themselves.
The final result may be affected by some still imper-
fectly determined corrections, and it will be sufficient to
here give an approximative one.
It appears probable that the true solar constant is one-
half greater than that determined by Pouillet and by
Herschel near the sea level, and even greater than the
recent values assigned by M. Violle. Thetrue value, it is
believed, will be shown by the data when published to be
larger than those hitherto accepted.
Of more general interest, perhaps, is the conclusion as
to the limit of that cold which increases under full sun-
is we ascend above our atmosphere. "What," it
isked, " would the temperature of the soil be on
1 top rising wholly above the air, or what the
iunward hemisphere of the earth, if
the present absorbing atmosphere were wholly with-
drawn?" The personal experiences already alluded to
may prepare the general reader for the paradoxical result

sun would appear of a strongly bluish tint, thus confirm-
ing observations already made at Alleghany by other
methods. It may be added in this connection that re-
searches also there made show a like action in the solar
atmosphere, so that we are not only to understand that
there is a tendency in both atmospheres to absorb the
short waves more than the long ones (as the writer has
elsewhere stated), but that the solar photosphere (while
emitting radiations of all wave-lengths in greater quantity
than we receive them), is, through the immense prepon-
derance of the more refrangible rays before absorption,
essentially blue, and that white light is not "the sum of
all-radiations," nor even of all visually recognisable ones,
but a composition of the small groups of special rays,
which, starting from this essentially blue sun, by virtue
of their large co-efficients of transmission, and by a kind
of survival of the fittest, have struggled through the solar
and terrestrial atmospheres, to us, while others of short
wave-length have failed on the way. This the Mount
Whitney observations, so far as regards the terrestrial
atmosphere at any rate, appear to prove.

Doubtless a distinction is to be drawn between the
statements of fact and records of direct observation,
which will shortly appear in full in the Signal Service

which the writer alone should be held responsible.
In view of the mass of observations on which they rest,

does not seem to him to express the result of careful and
repeated experiments, he hopes, however, that the results

ASIA
Asia. By A. H. Keane. Edited by Sir R. Temple.
(London: Edw. Stanford, 1882.)
TV/f R. KEANE'S encyclopaedic knowledge in matters
of philology and ethnology was never put to better
use than in the compilation of this account of Asia.
Considerable as is the size of the book, the information it
contains is compressed to the utmost; every word is
pregnant with meaning, and could not be omitted without

injury to the reader. The physical geography, the fauna
and flora, the commerce and inhabitants of the vast con-
tinent of Asia, are all passed under review; tribes and
dialects of which most of us have never even heard the
names are discoursed upon familiarly, and facts and
statistics bristle in every page. The latest authorities
have been everywhere consulted; the geographical results
of the late Afghan war, for instance, having been laid
under contribution, and full use being made of the
Palestine Exploration Survey, not only of Palestine itself
but of the eastern side of the Jordan as well. It must
not be supposed, however, that Mr. Keane's work is dry
reading; his literary ability has thrown an interest over
the most matter-of-fact statistics and made us realise the
characteristics of the countries he describes or the towns
and populations he records.
I need not point out the value to the Englishman of a
full and trustworthy compendium like this. As Sir Richard
Temple shows in his Preface to the book the interests of
England in Asia are enormous, and there is much truth
in the German assertion that so far as English power and

NATURE
linguistic polygeneity suppose that different forms of
speech grew up independently within the same race or
even among the members of a fixed race. It was a
question of geography not of race.
The assumption of the primitive unity of speech makes
Mr. Keane an adherent of another theory which I have
done my best elsewhere to combat. This is that languages
develop out of an isolating into an agglutinative stage,
and then into an inflectional one. I do not deny that
language develops; far from it: the whole science of
language is based upon such an assumption. But I can
see no facts which warrant me in holding that an isolating
language, for example, has ever developed except from
one stage of isolation into another. In the same way the
inflectional languages have developed only from one form
of inflection into another; this is certainly true of the
Semitic dialects, and as to the Aryan languages, Dr.
Delbriick, the latest defender of Mr. Keane's theory, finds
himself forced to admit at the end of a long discussion
that a confident "yes" cannot be returned to the question
whether the agglutination theory is verified in individual

cases. It is only in the sense that the jelly-fish may be
called simple that the development of language can be
said to be from the simple to the complex; from one
point of view, it is true, analysis and differentiation may
be termed complex, but most of us would consider our
modern English grammar a much simpler affair than that
of Gothic or Greek. I may note here, by the way, that
Mr. Keane has made a slip in saying that the final r of
amatur is the reflexive pronoun se. R is also the
characteristic of the passive in Old Keltic where it
cannot come from an earlier s; it is further found in
some Vedic verbal forms, and apparently in the Greek
dev-p-o, where it occupies the same position as in the
Latin ama-r-is.
Different views, however, as to the conclusions to be
drawn from our evidence are inevitable in science, more
especially in matters where certainty is unattainable.
They in no way diminish the value or importance of Mr.
Keane's work, which does not depend on the theories held
byjhimself or any one else regarding the facts put forward
in it. He has made " Asia" an indispensable book of refer-
ence to the geographer, the traveller, and the statistician;
I will not add the politician also, as the main business of
the latter nowadays seems to be to avoid acquiring accu-

Thus I am not disposed to endorse the assertion that the
Turks in Smyrna "reside chiefly in narrow, dirty slums,
into which it is dangerous to penetrate alone, and which
are cut off from access to the more open and safer
quarters." On the contrary, in walking from the Kassaba
station to the quay, when alone and at night, I have
always taken good care to go through the Turkish quarter
and not through the Greek. Elsewhere, however, Mr.
Keane does full justice to the Turks of Anatolia, whom
he describes in Dr. Scherzer's words as " honourable in

There is no trade, we suppose, in which so many special
tools are used as in watchmaking, nor any in which the
character of a workman is so readily distinguished by
them. The good workman has good toolsa perfect
army of themnearly all self-made, with which he is
prepared to execute any piece of work, in a neat, clean,

and efficient manner.
This little book describes watchmakers' tools, but
deals with many operations inadmissible from a manufac-
turer's point of view. "Every watchmaker," says the
preface, "will at once recognise that receipts are included
which are of the nature of makeshifts, and that it would
in many cases be better to replace a piece by a new one,
rather than to repair it it in the manner indicated." But
there is good reason for this :"The immense number of
badly-constructed watches that he (the workman) is called
upon to put in going order for a trifling remuneration,
compels him to replace the older methods of procedure
by others, whenever by so doing time can be saved."
If watches were as big as steam-engines there are few
people who would not be horrified at the kind of work
put into some of them. But they go well? so they may
(or may not), thanks to a strong mainspring, until they
are pulled to pieces.
All watch repairers, or "jobbers," as they are techni-
cally called, and manufacturers too, ought, however, to
be interested in this book. It contains a great deal of

of mountains is calculated, and to which barometrical readings are reduced.
This assumption, however, is called in question by several
mathematicians, who allege that the sea-level is by no means
that of a regular spheroid, as is generally supposed, but may
vary many hundreds of feet in level even along the same parallel
of latitude, quite independently of the temporary action of winds
or of ocean currents.
According to the law of gravitation, all substances attract one
another with a force proportional to their masses. A continent of
land will therefore exert an attractive influence upon the sea,
and cause it to rise upon its shores to a height which will vary
according to the mass of land that causes the attraction, and
may amount, it is said, to as much as 1000 metres above the
level to which the sea attains in mid-ocean. This extraordinary
result is deduced by Ph. Fischer from a discussion of pendulum-
observations, and somewhat similar conclusions are arrived at by
Listing and Heinrich Bruns.
Founding upon these observations, a German geologist, Dr.
Penck, has proposed an explanation of the phenomena presented
by the raised beaches, and other tokens of oscillation in the sea-
level, which are so conspicuous during the glacial period. If
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
the land has the property of thus drawing the sea towards it in
proportion to its mass, it follows that anything which adds to
that mass will increase the effect, and thus a great thickness of
glacier-ice laid upon a continent, will draw the water towards it,
and raise the sea-level in its immediate vicinity; and, according
as the ice increases or diminishes, so will the level of the sea
rise or fall in proportion. Moreover, the altitude of the sea-
beach may vary considerably, it is -aid, along the border of one
and the same continent, by reason of the varying thickness of the
ice in different parts. In this way it is conceived an explanation
is found for the fact that in Norway the old terraces and sea-
beaches do not coincide in level, bat vary in altitude at places not
very far distant from one another. The action of the ice may
in short be so localised that its attractive force w ill vary consi-
derably along the same line of coast.
These views are certainly somewhat different from those that
have hitherto prevailed in regard to the regularity of the sea-level.
If there is such a very great difference in the height to which
the surface of the sea may attain in different places, the baro-
meter should give more indication of it than it seems to do.
Nevertheless, it is to be desired that every means should be
taken to ascertain the relative height of the sea in various places
so chosen as to test the truth of the views I have mentioned.
The apparent connection between glaciation and submergence is
now attracting notice in various quarters. Dr. Penck maintains

that shifts in the relative level of sea and land go hand in hand
with oscillations in the glaciation. In 1865 I called attention
to this connection, and suggested what seemed to me to be a
possible explanation of it (see Journ. of theGeol. Soc. vol. xxi
p. 178).
Penck's views, it will be seen, are somewhat different from
those of Adhemarand Croll, to which he points out sever 1
objections. His memoir is entitled "Schwankungen des
Meeresspiegels," and appears in the Jalirbuch dcr Ceograph.

The above heading in Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 29, rather
surprises me, as though voices in lizards were a recent discovery.
The loud and plaintive "gui gui gui" made by the large land
lizard of that name, has been well known to me foi the last
seventeen years, and is of course well known to every Assamese.
The call is always heard in twilight, in the depths of the forest,
and when once heard is not mistakable for that of any other animal.
It is plain, monotonous, loud, and repeated with two second in-
tervals some eight or ten times, when there is a pause of about

tial is, of course, equivalent to an electromotive force
acting along the flame. The want of concord amongst
different observers, not only as to the cause of the
electrical properties of flame, but even as to what those
properties were, is most singular. Probably a great part
of it arises from the omission to notice one very im-
portant point, namely, the part played in these electrical
phenomena by the sheet or mantle of hot air surrounding
the flame externally. Almost all these observers have
used as their instrument of investigation either a coarse
gold-leaf electroscope, or else a galvanometer. The
want of sensitiveness and accuracy in the former instru-
ment when applied to small differences of potential, makes
the former unsuitable; whilst the high resistance offered
by the flame itself to the passage of electricity renders the
use of the latter inadvisable.
In beginning their investigation, therefore, Messrs.
Elster and Geitel bethought themselves of Sir W. Thom-
son's quadrant electrometer as admirably suited for deli-
cate and quantitative experiments of the kind in hand,

and with this instrument they set themselves to investi-
gate the correctness or otherwise of that which previous
observers had announced.
Their apparatus was set up as follows :To keep the
needle of the electrometer at a constant charge, it was
connected with one pole of a Zamboni's dry pile con-
sisting of 2400 pairs of disks, the other pole being joined
to "earth." The electrometer thus arranged was very
sensitive, a difference of potential of a single Daniell's
cell producing a deflexion of 112 degrees upon the scale
of the instrument. One pair of quadrants was as usual
put to "earth," and a suitable commutator (c in Fig. 1)
was interposed between the electrometer and the flame-
apparatus. Experiments were made on the flames of
Bunsen burners and of spirit-lamps, both well insulated.
A small Bunsen burner specially adapted for this purpose
was constructed out of a piece of glass tubing 4 milli-
metres wide. Fig. 1 shows the manner of exploring the
flame. One electrode, A, consisting of a platinum wire
inclosed in a glass tube from which the end protruded,
was inserted in the tip of the flame. Another electrode,
B, of similar kind was fixed so as to pass into the base of
the flame. Two points were revealed by the first experi-
ments made:
1. That when set in this fashion the tip was usually
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
electrically negative, as compared with the base of the
flame, as Hankel had said, but that sometimes the reverse
appeared to be the case.
2. That when the lower electrode was kept fixed, and
the upper one was moved to different heights, the poten-
tial anywhere within the interior of the flame was the
same, being 1*04 times that of one Daniell's cell when
the electrodes were 1 millimetre apart, and the same when
they were 20 millimetres apart.
If, as Hankel expresses it, a flame were "polarised"
longitudinally, cross-sections taken horizontally across the
flame should be equipotential surfaces. This is true if
the two platinum electrodes a and b are both right within
the flame. Whether at the same level or not, when both
are completely within the flame they are practically at the
same potentialneither of them positive or negative rela-
tively to the other. But if one of the electrodes is dis-
placed to one side, a difference of potential is immediately
observed, and this difference is very great if (as in Fig. 1)
one electrode passes no further than into the external
mantle of hot air.

burn with a flame in an atmosphere of coal-gas the very
same phenomena are observed, the hot coal-gas being
positive relatively to the air-flame. All these flames
showed a potential varying from about 1J to IJ times that
of a Daniell's cell. The flame of bisulphide of carbon
gave a lower result, and so did a magnesium flame. The
introduction of any salt of a metalsuch as chloride of
potassiuminto the flame lowered the potential.
Moreover when wires of other metals were employed
the differences of potential were not the same as before.
Whilst the lower electrode of platinum remained, the
upper electrode was replaced by a copper wire when the
potential rose to 2 Daniell's cells. With aluminium it
was equal to 3, and with magnesium to 3"2 Daniell's.
Using a lump of clean sodium as electrode the potential
even rose to five times the Daniell cell.
Using as a fluid electrode a drop of water at the end of
a capillary tube similar results were obtained, though the
differences of potential were smaller.
These experiments corroborate the suggestion that the
flame acts like the acids between the poles of a battery-

cell, or that the action is an "electrolytic" one.
Messrs. Elster and Geitel succeeded in joining elec-
trically together the flames of twenty-five spirit-lamps, by
the device of causing a curved piece of platinum wire to
lead from the base of one flame to the tip of the next, and
another piece of wire from the base of this to the tip of
the succeeding one, and so on. This "flame-battery"
of course had a potential twenty-five times as great as
that of one flame. But it would not yield much current,
owing to the enormous internal resistance of the flames
themselves.
Another most important series of researches was then
undertaken to investigate whether, without any flame or
any products of combustion, a difference of potential
could be observed between a red-hot platinum wire and a
cold platinum wire whose tip was immersed in the cur-
rents of heated air that rose from the former. This was
accomplished by using as one electrode a thin platinum
wire heated to redness by passing through it the current
of a battery. And here, without any flame, a difference
of potential of about one and a half of a Daniell's cell
was found, the upper electrode being positive, relatively
to the glowing one. From this experiment, which was
confirmed in a variety of ways, it appears that a flame is
not in itself a source of electrification at all. Messrs.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Elster and Geitel therefore regard the electrification as a
thermo-electric phenomenon; though they use this term
in a slightly different sense from that in which it is used
in the text-books.
They conclude, therefore, that the production of elec-
trification by flames is (1) independent of the size of the
flame; (2) dependent on the nature and state of surface
of the electrodes; (3) dependent on the nature of the
gases that are burning in the flame; and (4) dependent
on the state of ignition of the electrodes.
They therefore regard Pouillet's theory as being wrong,
whilst the theories of Matteucci (and Hankel) and of
Buff are both, so far as they go, correct. If this so-called
thermo-electric origin of the electrification be the true
one it is a very important fact indeed; and, as these able
experimenters say, will probably explain the back-electro-
motive force which is observed in the voltaic arc. This
is not the least interesting point in this very interesting
research. S. P. T.

Geraniacece and Malvacea, thereby show themselves to

carpels are quite separate and scattered, like the simpler

as the Caryophyllacece, in which all the five primitive
carpels have completely coalesced into a single one-celled
ovary. Accordingly, it is not remarkable that the pinks
should never be yellow. On the other hand, this family
has no very specialised members, like larkspur and
monkshood, and therefore, it very rarely produces bluish
or purplish flowers. Pinks, in fact, do not display so
wide a range in either direction as RanunculacetT. They
begin as high up as white, and hardly get any higher than
red or carnation. Of their two sub-families, the Alsincce
have the sepals free, the blossoms widely expanded, and
no special adaptations for insect fertilisation. They in-

clude all the small undeveloped field species, such as the
chickweeds (Stellaria media, Arenaria trinervis, Ceras-
tium vulgatum, &c), stitchworts {Stellaria holostea, &c),
and cornspurries (Spergula arvensis), which have open
flowers of a very primitive character; and almost all of them
are white (Fig. 12). These are fertilised by miscellaneous
small flies. The Silenea, on the other hand, including
the campions and true pinks, have a tubular calyx, formed
by the coalescence of the five sepals; and the expanded
petals are raised on long claws, which makes their honey,
inclosed in the tube, accessible only to the higher insects.
Most of them also display special adaptations for a better
class of insect fertilisation in the way of fringes or crowns
on the petals. These more profoundly modified kinds
are generally pink or red. For example, in the most
advanced British genus, Dianthus, which has usually
vandyked edges to the petals, our four English species
are all brightly coloured; D. armeria, the Deptford pink,
being red with dark spots, D. prolifer purplish red, D.
deltoides, the maiden pink, rosy spotted with white, and
D. casius, the Cheddar pink, bright rose-coloured (Fig.
'3)- .
It is much the same with the allied genus Lychnis. Our
own beautiful purple English corn-cockle (L. githago), is
a highly developed campion, so specialised that only

butterflies can reach its honey with their long tongue?, as
the nectaries are situated at the bottom of the tube. Two
other species of campion, however, show us interestingly
the way in which variations of colour may occur in a
retrograde direction even among highly evolved forms.
One of them, the clay lychnis (L. diurna), has red, scent-
less flowers, opening in the morning, and it is chiefly
fertilised by diurnal butterflies. But its descendant, the
night lychnis (L. vespertina), has taken to fertilisation by-
means of moths ; and as moths can only see white flowers
it has become white, and has acquired a faint perfume as
an extra attraction (Fig. 14). Still, the change has not
yet become fully organised in the species, for one may
often find a night lychnis at the present time which is
only pale pink, instead of being pure white.
The Crucifcrcc are a family which display a good deal
of variety in colouration. The most primitive and simple
forms have yellow flowers, as in the case of the cabbage
genus (Brassica) including charlock, mustard, and turnip;

greater number of them, like the harebell {Campanula
rotundifolid) and the Canterbury bell (C. media), are deep
blue (Fig. 15). We have nine British species of the genus,
varying from pale sky-blue to ultramarine and purplish
cobalt, with an occasional relapse to white. Rampion and
sheep's bit, also blue, are clustered heads of similar
blossoms. The little blue lobelia of our borders, which is
bilateral as well as tubular, belongs to a closely-related
tribe. One of our British species, Lobelia Dortmanna,

far from them are the Dipsacece, including the lilac sca-
bious, the blue devil's bit, and the mauve teasel. Amongst
all these very highly-evolved groups blue distinctly forms
the prevalent colour.
In the great family of the Ericacea, or heaths, which is
highly adapted to insect fertilisation, more particularly
by bees, purple and rose are the prevailing tints, so much
so that, as we all have noticed a hundred times over, they
often colour whole tracts of hillside together. The bell-

vated. In Plumbaginea we have the bluish purple sea-
lavender (Statice Limoniuni) and the pink thrift (Armeria

receive notice later on.
It is necessary, however, here briefly to refer to the
great family of Composita, some of whose peculiarities
can only properly be considered when we come to inquire
into the phenomena of relapse and retrogression. Never-
theless, even at the present stage they afford some excel-
lent evidence. In certain ways they may be regarded as
the very highest race of flowering plants. Not only are
their petals united into a tubular corolla, but their
blossoms are compounded into large groups of a very
attractive sort. Each flower-head consists of a number
of small florets, crowded so as to resemble a single

blossom. So far as our present purpose is concerned, they
fall naturally into three groupsJussieu's old-fashioned
sub-orders of Ligulala; Cynaroidea:, and Corymbifera',
which are quite sufficient for all ordinary objects of
botanical study.
We can only examine the last-named tribe at present,
whose central florets, as a rule, are bright golden; a fact
which shows pretty certainly that they are descended

from a common ancestor who was also yellow. Moreover,
these yellow florets are bell shaped. But the outer florets
are generally sterile; and instead of being bell-shaped,

they form a long ray; while their corolla is at the same
time much larger than that of the central blossoms. In
short, they are sterilised members of the compound
flower-head, specially set apart for the work of display;
and thus they stand to the entire flower-head in the same
relation as petals do to the simple original flower. Just
as the petal is a specialised and sterilised stamen told off
to do duty as an allurer of insects for the benefit of the
whole flower, so the ray-floret is a specialised and steril-
ised blossom told off to do the self-same duty for the
benefit of the composite flower-head.

NATURE
Now, the earliest ray-florets would naturally be bright
yellow, like the tubular blossoms of the central disk from
which they sprang. And to this day the ray-florets of
the simplest corymbiferous types, such as the corn-mari-
gold {Chrysanthemum segetum), the sun-flower (Helianthus
atinuus), and the ragwort (Senecio jacobaa), are yellow,
like the central flowers. In the camomile, however, the
ox-eye daisy, and the may-weed (Anthemis cotula, Chrys-
anthemum leucanthemum, &c), the rays have become
white; and this, I think, fairly establishes the fact that
white is a higher development of colour than yellow; for
the change must surely have been made in order to attract
special insects. In the true daisy, again (Bellis perennis),
the white rays become tipped with pink, which sometimes
rises almost to rose-colour (Fig. 16); and this stage is exactly
analogous to that of apple-blossom, which similarly halts
on the way from white petals to red. In our own asters
(A. tripolium, &c.)and the Michaelmas daisies of Ame-
rica, we get a further advance to purple, lilac, and mauve,
while both in these and in the chrysanthemums, true
shades of blue not infrequently appear. The Cinerarias

of our gardeners are similar forms of highly-developed
groundsels from the Mediterranean and the Canary
Islands.
Tubular flowers with an irregular corolla are obviously
higher in their mode of adaptation to insect visits than
tubular flowers of the ordinary symmetrical type.
Amongst them, the first place must be assigned to the
Labiates. Not only are they deeply tubular, but they are
very bilateral and irregular indeed, displaying more modi-
fication of form than almost any other flowers except the
orchids. They mostly secrete abundant honey, and often
possess highly aromatic perfumes. Almost all of them
are purple or blue. Among the best known English species
are thyme, mint, marjoram, sage (Fig. 17),and basil, which
it need hardly be said are great favourites with bees.
Ground-ivy (iVepeta glechoma) is bright blue; catmint
(Nepeta cataria), pale blue; Prunella, violet-purple; and
common bugle (Ajuga rcptans), blue or flesh colour.
Many of the others are purple or purplish. It must be
added that in this family the flowers are very liable to
vary within the limit of the same species; and red, white,
or purple specimens are not uncommon in many of the
normally blue kinds.
The Scrophularincai, and other allied irregular tubular
families are mostly spotted, and so belong to a later stage

of our inquiry ; but even amongst this group, the Veronica
genus has almost always pure blue flowers; foxglove
(Digitalispurpurea) is purple; and many of the Broom-
rapes (Orobanchacece) are more or less bluish. Blue and
lilac also appear abundantly in spots or stripes in many
species of Linaria, in Euphrasia, and in other genera.
We have given so much consideration to the Dicoty-
ledons that the relatively simple and homogeneous Mono-
cotyledons need not detain us long. Their coloration is
as a whole both less complicated and less instructive.
The Alismacea answer very closely to the Ranun-
culacea, as being in all probability the earliest surviving
type of entomophilous Monocotyledons. Their arrange-
ment is of course trinary, but they have similarly separate
carpels, often numerous, surrounded by one, two, three,
or many rows of stamens, and then by one row of three
petals and one row of three sepals. All our English
species, however, are white or rosy, instead of yellow.
As they are marsh plants, they seem to have reached
or passed the stage of Ranunculus aquatilis. One species,

outfit of astronomical observatories. Since Tycho Brahe"
built his great establishment at Uraniburg, astronomical
research has been associated in the public mind with lofty
observatories and great telescopes. Whenever a monarch
has desired to associate his name with science, he has de-
signed an observatory proportional to the magnitude of
his ambition, fitted it out with instruments on a corre-
sponding scale, and then rested in serene satisfaction.
If we measure greatness by cubic yards, then Peter the
Great and " Le Grand Monarque" were the founders of
two of the greatest observatories ever built. That of St.
Petersburg was completed in 1725, the year of Peter's
death, and was an edifice of two hundred and twenty-five
feet front, with central towers one hundred and forty feet
high. It had three tiers of galleries on the outside for
observation, and was supplied with nearly every instru-
ment known to the astronomers of the time, without refer-
ence to the practicability of finding observers to use them.
It was nearly destroyed by fire in 1747, but was partially
rebuilt, and now forms part of the building occupied by
the Imperial Academy of Sciences. The Paris Observa-

tory, built half a century earlier, still stands, its massive
walls and arched ceilings reminding one rather of a fortress
than of an astronomical institution.
Notwithstanding the magnificence of these structures,
they have had little essential connection with the progress
of astronomy. It is true that the work done at both
establishments takes a prominent place in the history of
science, but most of it could have been done equally well
under wooden sheds erected for the protection of the
instruments from the weather. In recent times, the St.
Petersburg Observatory has been found so unsuitable for
its purpose that no observation of real value can be made,
and its existence has been nearly forgotten. The great
building at Paris, though associated with a series of
astronomical researches second to none in the world, has
really served scarcely any other purpose than those of a
physical laboratory, store-house, and offices. The more
important observations have always been made in the
surrounding garden, or in inexpensive wings or other
structures erected for the purpose.
With these establishments it will be instructive to com-
pare the Greenwich Observatory. The latter has never
won the title of great. It was originally established on
the most modest scale, for the special purpose of making
such observations as would conduce to the determination
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of the longitude at sea. Although it has now entered
upon its third century, no attempt has ever been made to
reconstruct it on a grand scale. Whenever any part of it
was found insufficient for its purpose, new rooms were
built for the special object in view, and thus it has been
growing from the beginning by a process as natural and
simple as that of the growth of a tree. Even now, the
money value of its structure is less than that of several
other public observatories, although it eclipses them all in
the results of its work. Haeckel lays it down as a general
law of research that the amount of original investigation
actually prosecuted by a scientific institution is inversely
proportional to its magnitude. Although this may be re-
garded as a humorous exaggeration, it teaches what the
history of science shows to be a valuable lesson.
A glance at the number and work of the astronomical
observatories of the present time will show how great a
waste of means has been suffered in their erection and
management. The last volume of the American Ephe-
meris contains a list of nearly 150 observatories, sup-
posed to be, or to have recently been, in a state of " astro-

other, would do everything necessary for the department
of research to which they are applicable, and a great deal
more than is to be expected from all the meridian circles
of the world, under the conditions in which they are
actually placed. They could, within the first five years,
make several independent determinations of the funda-
mental data of astronomy, including the positions and
motions of several hundred of the brighter fixed stars.
In five years more they could extend their activity so as
to fix the position of every star in the heavens visible to
the naked eye; and, during the ten years following, could
prepare such a catalogue of telescopic stars as there is no
prospect of our seeing during the next half-century.
There are probably not less than twenty meridian circles
in this country alone, most of them antiquated, it is true,

idleness upon their pivots. With others some industrious
professor or student would be found making, unaided, a
series of observations to be left among the records of the
establishment, or immured in the pages of the Aslrono-
tuisclie NachrichUn, with small chance in either case of
ever being used. We may be sure that the solitary ob-
server will soon find something else to do, and leave the
instrument once more in idleness. Others we should find
employed in the occasional instruction of students, a
costly instrument being used where a rough and cheap
one, which the student could take to pieces and investi-
gate at pleasure, would answer a far better purpose. Yet
others we should find used in distributing time to the
neighbouring cities or states, or regulating chronometers
for the shipping of a port. I dare not guess how many
we should find engaged in work really requiring an
instrument of the finest class, and gaining results which
are to contribute to the astronomy of the future, but in
our own country there would hardly be more than three.
The general cause of this state of things lies upon the
surface. It is as true in astronomy as in any other
department of human affairs that the best results can be
attained only by a careful adaptation of means to ends.
Failures have arisen, not from the intervention of any
active opposing agency, but because observatories have

been founded without a clear conception of the object to
be attained, and therefore without the best adaptation of
means to ends. To b.iild an observatory before knowing
what it is going to do is much like designing a machine-
shop and putting in a large collection of improved tools
and machinery before concluding what the shop is to
make, and what are the conditions of the market open to
its products. Some hints on the considerations which
should come into play in the erection of any new observa-
tory may not be out of place, as pointing out the remedy
for the evils we have described.
Heretofore the practice has usually been first to decide
upon the observatory, and to plan the building; next to
provide instruments; and lastly, to select an astronomer,
and with his advice, to decide what direction the activi-
ties of the establishment should take. This order of pro-
ceeding should be reversed. The first thing to be done
is to decide what the observatory shall be built to do.
The future astronomer would, of course, have a control-
ling voice in this decision, and should, therefore, be
selected in advance. One thing which it is especially

most of the purposes of the astronomical student. What
the latter really wants is that training of the eye and the

which they are subject, and the mathematical principles
involved in their application. In this, as in nearly every
department of professional education, we may lay it down
as a rule that the wants of a liberal and of a professional
education are, so far as the foundation is concerned,
identical. We are too prone to lead the student into the
minute details of a subject without that previous training
in first broad principles which, though it may not imme-

of instruction. Scarcely any higher skill than that of a

with the aid of this instrument, to determine the error of
his clock or watch within a few seconds. If he is really

NOTES
The following details regarding the sad accident by which
Prof. Balfour lost his life have been received since Prof. Foster's article was written. It appears (from a letter from Mr. C. D.
Cunningham to the Times) that on the 14th ult. Mr. Balfour cro-scd
the Col da Ge'ant, and on descending on the Italian side the
idea first occurred to him of attempting the Aiguille Blanche de
Peuteret, or, as it is sometimes called, the Aiguille de la Belle
Etoile, a peak which is one of the buttresses of Mont Blanc, to
the massif of which it is joined by an extremely steep snow arete.
Mr. Cunningham's guide, Emile Key, had previously attempted
the peak, and was able to give Mr. Balfour many details as to the
probable line of ascent. Having failed, however, to persuade Mr.
Cunningham and the guide Key to accompany him, Mr. Balfour
started from Courmaycur on Tuesday, the iSth, with the guide Johann Petrus, for Aiguille, accompanied by a porter to carry
blankets and wood as far as their sleeping-place on the rocks.
It was thought, the ascent being now and difficult, he might be

absent two nights, and return to Courmayeur on Thursday. As
he did not reappear, it was thougl t he must have crossed to
Chamounix, or gone down to the Chalets de Visaille for more
provisions. On Friday Mr. Bertolini and Mr. Baker, at the
hotel in Courmayeur, became sen usly alarmed, and finding the
party had not been heard of either at Chamounix or at the
Chalets de Visaille, they sent out a search party, which, early on
Sunday morning, on reaching the rocks between the Glacier de
Brouillard and the Glacier de Freny, found the bodies of Mr.
Balfour and Petrus, both partly covered with snow, it the foot
of the steep snow arlte. As there was little fresh snow about the place, it was probably not an avalanche that caused their
death. One may have slipped, and the other not had suffi-
cient strength to hold his compani n. The provisions at the
sleeping-place having been untouched, the accident must have
taken place on Wednesday, the 19th. But it is not certain
whether they fell in descent or ascent. Means were taken on
the 25th to have the remains brought to the hotel.

Mr. W. B. Cooper has lately brought before the Franklin

a diaphragm or other pulsating body; the wire is passed a half
turn or several turns round a drum or pulley, which is rotated
towards the diaphragm. To the other end may be attached a
lever having a point adapted to indentation of sheet metal passed
under it at uniform speed. With such an arrangement (called a
"phonodynamograph ") Mr. Cooper has embossed brass of the
thickne-5 of writing paper by impact of the voice on a diaphragm
like that of the phonograph. (The force of the pull is augmented
by force derived from friction on the surface of the pulley).
The principle is applicable to the telephone, both for increasing
the intensity of the electric impulses transmitted, and augmenting
their effects at the receiving station, and Mr. Cooper shows how
this may be advantageously done.

""THE theory of universal gravitation, as I understand it, asserts
that the mutual attraction exerted by any two bodies, A and
T., is dependent only on their respective masses and on the dis-
t-ince between them, being entirely uninfluenced by the presence
of other bodies even in the immediate neighbourhood of A or
B. Thus at a given moment the Earth and Venus, being in
certain definite positions, exert upon each other a certain force
of attraction; the attraction thus taking place between the
masses of the two planets would be unaltered by the removal
of the Moon from the sphere of action; the gravitation of the
Earth and the Moon does not therefore tie up any portion of the
attractive energy of the Earth, and so diminish the force with
which other bodies gravitate towards it.
A totally different assumption is usually made with regard to
that form of attraction which gives rise to chemical phenomena.
Here it is supposed that two or more atoms, having combined
together, have thereby become incapable, at any rate in the
majority of cases, of attracting others to any appreciable extent. Thus 1 imagine that most chemists hold the view that when
hydrogen and oxygen combine together to form water they
thereby exhaust, or nearly exhaust, their combining power, that
the power of attraction residing in the oxygen atoms is all
concentrated upon the hydrogen atoms, jut as we might con-
ceive all the attractive power of the Earth concentrated on
the moon, thus leaving all other bodies in its neighbourhood
free from the influence of gravity. We thus invest matter with

two separate forms of attraction differing entirely in their mode
of action, and having indeed nothing in common. It is however
possible to a certain extent to assimilate chemical attraction and
gravitation, and I propose here to discuss some of the results
which ensue from the elaboration of this idea Let us suppose
then that the act of chemical combination in no wise alters the
power of attraction which the combining atoms exert upon sur-
rounding bodies, and let us see what effect this hypothesis has
upon the explanation of various phenomena. In order to do this
we must first render as precise as possible our notions of the
construction of chemical compounds.
It is now known with certainty that the atomic and molecular
volumes of substances are but slightly altered by combination,
that is to say, that under comparable conditions the atom of any
substance generally occupies about the same space with whatever
atoms, similar or dissimilar, it may be combined. This fact
seems to me to point to the conclusion that the atoms which make
up a molecule are as close together as their periodic motions will
permit, and are not merely held in certain positions of equili-
brium by various opposing forces; for if the latter supposition
were true, I fail to see how it would be possible for the same

toy noticed that the thermal change accompanying the formation of
sat any one of these gase-', HC1, for example, is not a true measure
of the attraction between the atoms, since it also includes the
litir heat employed in separating the atoms of the original molecules
. ai Ha and Cls.
We may also find a confirmation of the above views in the
many homologous series of organic chemistry. In the alcohols
liter; of the ethyl scries, for example, the larger the molecules the
ie a greater must be the attraction between them, and consequently
tint., the higher the boiling-point; this, as is well known, is in
accordance with fact. In the case of isomeric alcjhols, the
influence of the position of the atoms comes conspicuously to
iia the fore. It is clear that if the atoms of carbon of two different
n si molecules cannot approach each other so nearly in the case of
<c one isomer as in another, the attraction between the molecules
will be less, and the boiling-point con-equently lower. Now in
ok. secondary and tertiary alcohols the carbjn atoms are more shel-
ra;;. tered by each other, are, as it were, more removed from the
ni ¦. exterior of the molecule than in primary alcohols; at the same

time the boiling-points are lower, which is as it should be.
M f If we replace two atoms of hydrogen in an alcohol by one of
a -5 oxygen we increase the attraction of the molecule-, since we
it-, .substitute a certain number of attractions {ho) and [c0) for the
relatively small attractions (h It) and (c h); the increase of boil-
ing-point which we should expect is confirmed by experiment.
ant Many other examples might be brought forward, were it not
..,« that their discussion would transcend the limits of this article.
Before concluding I should like to draw attention to one ques-
tion which is of importance. The use of the above hypothesis
renders it difficult at first sight to account for the formation of
definite chemical compounds; it seems that if any number of
atoms of hydrogen are equally attracted by one of chlorine, the
combination of ona of them with that atom would not prevent
the adherence of a second and a third forming H2C1, H,C1, &c.
This difficulty is avoided by supposing that the chlorine atom is
of such a form that only one atom of hydrogen can approach suffi-
ciently closely to adhere permanently; such forms are difficult to
 imagine, though it may be remarked that an atom in the form
of a ring offers in a certain sense a unique position to another
which instals itself inside it. The existence of molecular com-
pounds proves that the permanent adherence of other atoms is
sometimes possible, and thus affords material support to the
notion that the chemical affinity of an atom is not only exerted
upon those atoms with which it is combined, but upon all others

THE GESTURE SPEECH OF MAN'
A NTHROPOLOGY tells the march of mankind out of
¦"¦ savagery, in which different peoples have advanced in
varying degrees, but all started in progress in civilisation from
a point lower than that now occupied by the lowest of the tribes
now found on earth. The marks of their rude origin, retained
by all, are of the same number and kind, though differing in
distinctness, showing a common origin to all intellectual and
social development, notwithstanding present diversities. The
most notable criterion of difference is in the copiousness and
precision of oral speech, and connected with that, both as to
origin and structure, is the unequal survival of gesture signs,
which it is believed once universally prevailed. Where sign-
language survives it is, therefore, an instructive vestige of the
prehistoric epoch, and its study may solve problems in philology
and psychology. That study is best pursued by comparing the
pre-eminent gesture system of the North American Indians with
the more degenerate or less developed systems of other peoples.

European influence and officially segregated from all other.-.
Collections had been obtained from the Iroquois, Ojibwas,
Alaskans, Apaches, Tuni, Pimas, Papagos and Maricopas, after
army officers, missionaries, Indian agents, and travellers had
denied them to be possessed of any knowledge on the subject.
The studies so far pursued led to the conclusion that at the
time of the discovery of North America all its inhabitants
practised sign language, though with different degrees of expert-
ness, and that while under changed circumstances it was disused
by some, others, in especial those who, after the acquisition of
horses, became nomads of the great plains, retained and culti-
vated it to the high development now attained.
Instances were presented of the ascertained permanence of
some Indian signs, and those of foreign peoples and deaf mutes.
Though they, as well as words, animals and plants, have had
their growth, development, and change, those which are general
both among Indian tribes, and are also found in other parts of
the world, must be of great antiquity. Many signs but little
differentiated were unstable, while others that have proved to be
the best modes of expression have survived as definite and
established.

The Indian system as a whole was compared with those of
foreign peoplesthe ancient Greeks and Romans and the modern
Italians being first considered. His researches during several
years showed a surprising number of signs for the same idea
which were substantially identical not only among savage tribes, but among all peoples that used gesture signs with any freedom.
This remark applied to the collections of signs already obtained
by correspondence from among the Turks, Armenians, and
Koords, the Bushmen of Africa, the Fijians, the Kedjangs and
Lelongs of Sumatra, the Chinese and the Australians. In com-
paring the Indian sign language with deaf mute signs, it was
noticeable that the Indians who had been brought to the Eastern
States had often held happy intercourse by signs with white
deaf mutes, who surely had no semiotic code preconcerted with
any of the plain roamers. Many of their signs were identical,
and all sooner or later were mutually understood. The result of
all these comparisons was that the so-called sign language of
Indians was not, properly speaking, one language, but that it
and the gesture systems of deaf mutes and of all people consti-
tuted together one languagethe gesture speech of mankind
of which each system is a dialect.
The most interesting light in which Indians, as other lower
tribes of men, are to be regarded is in their present representa-
tion of the stage of evolution once passed through by our ances-
tors. Their signs, as well as their myths and customs, form a
part of the palaeontology of humanity. Their picture writings
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
are now translated by working on the hypothesis that their rude
form of graphic representation, when at the same time a system
of idiographic gesture signs prevailed, would probably have been
connected with the latter. Traces of the signs now used by the
Indians are also found in the ideographic pictures of the Egyp-
tian, Chinese, and Aztec characters.
Signs often gave to spoken words their first significance, and
many primordial roots of language are found in bodily actions.
Examples were given of English, Indian, Greek, and Latin
words in connection with gesture signs for the same meaning,
and the structure of the sign language was compared with the
tongues of this continent, and with reference also to old Asiatic
and African languages, showing similar operations of conditions
in the same psychologic horizon.
The most obvious application of sign language for its practical
utility depended ;upon the correctness of the view submitted,
that it is not a mere semaphoric repetition of motions to be
memorised from a limited traditional list, but a cultivable art,
founded upon principles which can be readily applied by travel-
lers. The advantage was not merely theoretical, but had been
demonstrated to be practical by a professor in a deaf-mute col-

It would seem from this unequal division of capacity that oral
speech remained rudimentary long after gesture had become an
efficient mode of communication. With due allowance for all
purely imitative sound?, and for the spontaneous action of vocal
organs under excitement, it appears that the connection between
ideas and words is only to be explained by a compact between
speaker and hearer which supposes the existence of a prior mode
of communication. This was probably by gesture. At least
we may accept it as a clue leading out of the labyrinth of philo-
logical confusion, and regulating the immemorial quest of man's
primitive speech.

Aeronautical Society, July 17.A paper, upon the action
of the pectoral muscle in the flight of a bird, was read by Mr.
Fred. W. Brearey. He said that it behoved all experimenters
in flight to reduce their theories into a demonstrable form. It
had often been stated for instance that the power exerted by a
bird in its flight had been greatly exaggerated, but no one had
hitherto proved his assertion. It was caf able how ever of satis-
factory proof by demonstrating artificially the action of the pec-
toral muscle, by the aid of which weight became an accessory to
power. When the bird committed itself to the air the upward
pressure in the wings stretched the elastic ligament, which formed
part of the muscle, to such an extent as to allow of the bird
gliding upon the air without any exertion. The weight of the
bird was the measure of this elasticity. It was said by some
that at least the bird must possess the power by the downward
stroke of the wing to raise its own weight. But Mr. Brearey
said that this was not an absolute necessity, because the reaction
of this elastic ligament aided the force of the down stroke. He

Baginski at the last meeting, on the cells of the stomach-wall,
and presented some microscopical preparations. Dr. Brosicke
gave a summary report on the re>ul's of his investigation of
normal bone-tissue. With a very favourable preparation, a
bone 200 years old, he could explain the nature of the "bone-
corpuscles" observed in fresh bones, for he was in a position to
inject them from the Haversian canals with a coloured mass.
Thereby was proved the existence of lacunae, which, by
their outrunning parts, commnnicate with the Haversian canals.
The entire bone-traversing system of cavities, lacuna;, their out-
runners, and the canals are inclosed in a proper skin, the limiting
membrane, which Dr. Brosicke was able to isolate and investigate
chemically. The limiting membrane hereupon showed reactions,
which essentially distinguish it from the intercellular substance,
and which entirely agree with the reactions of horn-tissue; it was
therefore named the "Keratin-layer." The contents of the
lacuna: are very different in different stages of development of
the bone. In the embryo, the lacunx are quite filled with
protoplasm; later, the protoplasm retires from the inter-

and the protoplasm-cell can be observed; at this stage,
probably, arises the "keratin-layer." At a further stage of
development, the contents of the lacuna? are transformed into fat,
the cells of which abundantly fill the cavitie-. The fat cells then
fall asunder into detritus, which is gradually dissolved, so that
the lacuna? remain empty, or, as the author supposes, filled with
a gas, probably carbonic acid. The proper lime-containing
bone-substance consists of fibres of the nature of connective
tissue, which are bedded in lines in different directions, make up
the layers of bone-material, and are held together by a structure-
less lime-containing cement-substance. This structure of the
lime containing bone-tissue has been described before, and Dr.
Brosicke has merely been able to confirm former data; but what
is specially to be noted as new, among the results of the inquiry,
is the demonstration of a limiting membrane clothing the entire
system of cavities, and its keratin-like character.

THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
SOUTHAMPTON is to have the honour this year (as
no doubt most of our readers are already aware) of
receiving the British Association for the Advancement
of Science during its fifty second Annual Meeting, which
will take place between the 23rd of August and the 1st of
September. The selection of Southampton for this pur-
pose is happy in many respects. The town has a history,
and is in itself attractive. It is near the sea, it is well-
built, it has beautiful surroundings; its Public Parks and
its Common are no mean objects of interest, it has supe-
rior hotel, boarding and lodging accommodation, and>
above all, it is excellently supplied, as we shall see below,
with Public and other Buildings in which to hold the
General and Sectional Meetings of the Association.
The proximity of Southampton to the Continent induces
a hope of the presence of some of the most eminent
men of science of France, Germany and other countries.
Steps have been taken to secure this ; and the visit of the
distinguished foreigners will probably form one of the
leading characteristics of the meeting.

The town and its immediate neighbourhood have always
been found extremely attractive to visitors, especially
during the months of August and September, when a very
large number of yachts assemble for the purpose of taking
part in the great regattas which are held at Cowes, Ryde,
Portsmouth, and Southampton itself; whilst the beautiful
scenery of the New Forest and the Isle of Wight can
easily be enjoyed. It will be seen in the sequel that
ample provision has been made by the Local Executive
Committee in this direction.
To the Archaeologist, Southampton presents much that
is interesting, possessing as it does many remains of
great antiquarian value,for instance, the Bar Gate and
the old Town Walls, Towers, &c, the birth-house of Isaac
Watts, the site of the old Spa, and other ruins,whilst
on the banks of Southampton Water stand the ruins
of Netley Abbey. Within very easy access of the town
are the City of Winchester, with its Cathedral, its
College, and the Hospital of St. Cross; the town of
Romsey, with its noble Abbey Church; the city of Salis-
bury withits beautiful early English Cathedral,its Blackmore
Museum, Old Sarum, Stonehenge, Cherbury, and Wilton
Park; and the village of Beaulieu, in the New Forest,
with the remains of Beaulieu Abbey. On the shores of
the Solent is Hurst Castle, and a little beyond, the Priory
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of Christchurch. In the Isle of Wight are Carisbrooke
Castle, the remains of a Roman villa in the village of
Carisbrooke, and the newly discovered Roman villa near
Brading: to say nothing of the Queen's residence at
Osborne House, and numerous other lovely sites and
spots.
Special facilities have been granted by the respective
authorities for inspecting the Royal Victoria Hospital at
Netley, the great Naval Arsenal, Dockyard, &c., at
Portsmouth, and the royal yacht Victoria and Albert.
To the Geologist the shores of the Solent display for
his investigation rocks of the greatest interest, some of
which at the present time occupy the attention of men

The scheme of excursions is very complete, and in-

THE CLIMATE OF ALEXANDRIA'

August 10, 1882J

NATURE
towards saturation in summer, the sky at the same time
becomes more completely cleared of clouds than in
winter. Thus the mean cloudiness in winter indicates
that four-tenths of the sky is covered, but in summer
there is only one-tenth. This increased relative humidity,
occurring simultaneously with increased clearness of sky,
is an important feature of the climate of Alexandria, being
productive of a heat in the direct rays of the sun much
less intense than the clearness of the sky and the latitude
might lead us to expect.
The mean annual temperature is 68°7, the minimum
being 57°'6 in January, and the maximum 780-o. in August.
The coldest January, itf'o, occurred in 1880, and the
warmest, 620' 1, in the following year, there being thus 8°"i
of a difference. No such difference occurred in the
summer months. Thus the coolest August was 77°7 in
1876, and the hottest, 8o°'2 in 1880, the difference being
only 2°"5. At Cairo the differences of temperature are
much greater. The daily range is considerably greater
than that of Alexandria ; the mean temperature of January-
is 54°'i, and of August 84~'5, and as regards variation of

the monthly temperatures from year to year, the mean of
January was 50*0 in 18S0, but 59°"2 in 1881 ; and the
mean of August was 8oc,6 in 1876. but go°7 in 1877, the
daily range for the two seasons being thus 9c-2 and io°"i.
At Alexandria the mean annual rainfall is 8-i2 inches,
falling on 44 days. The largest annual fall was 1075
inches in 1876, and the least 3-42 inches in 1879. The
following are the means in inches for the months:
January i'95, February 1-46, March 072, April 0-15, May
and September 0-02 each, June, July, and August nil,
October o'58, November 1-52, and December 170. Heavy
rainfalls are of occasional occurrence. During these seven
and a half years the fall for one day exceeded an inch on
13 occasions. The largest of these falls 3'oo inches,
occurred on October 7, 1876. Hail has been recorded
on nine separate days in all, and thunder and lightning
on eight days.
The following peculiarity in the annual march of the
temperature is noteworthy. The mean temperature of
June is 75°'o. July 77°'5, August 78°'9, September 77°7>
and October 74D4, from which it is seen that September
is warmer than July, and October nearly as warm as
June. This peculiarity is still more striking if we look
exclusively at the daily maximum temperatures which are
so important an element of climate. To show this, we

a ready sale for books lil e the one before us, which treat
of a few mining subjects in an elementary manner, and
more especially of ventilation, and the chemical and
physical properties of the gases that are commonly found
in mines. Mr. Bagot has evidently taken considerable
pains in amassing his information from various sources,
some of them original ; and, if we could only add that he
appears to have exercised the same degree of care in
placing it before the reader, in a concise and orderly form,
we would have little else besides commendation to bestow
upon his volume. As it is, however, we regret to observe
that the whole book is written in a somewhat discursive
and disjointed manner. It contains an impossible geo-
logical section on p. 109; and nearly every one of its
chapters teems with rules and advice for the guidance
of all sorts of colliery officials from the engineer
to the collier. We had hitherto imagined that the
General and Special Rules of the Coal Mines' Regu-
lation Act were already wcllnigh as complete as our
knowledge and experience could make them up to the
present time, and we think, therefore, that Mr. Bagot

might, without impropriety, have appended to his work
copies of those parts of both which have a direct bearing
upon his subject, selecting his examples of Special Rules
from amongst those which most meet with his approval.
Instead of pursuing such a simple and commendable
course, however, he chooses rather to give us his own
ideas of what these rules ought to have been; he endea-
vours to supply what he considers to be omissions, and
he makes many statements of a purely dogmatical
character which could not bear the touch of close and
careful reasoning. Let us take what he says about the
duties of a fireman, at p. 73, as an example :
"The fireman's duties are very hazardous. He is a
competent person solely employed to test the pit for gas.
When inflammable gas has been found (and we presume
that all viewers will see the propriety of examining before
each shift begins work, even where it has not been found)
he has to examine the pit once in every shift, or once in
every twenty-four hours; should he find gas, he must
report the same in a book kept for the purpose. The Act
should have made him post a notice at the pit-head con-
taining extracts from the book, showing briefly where gas
had been found throughout the mine. He also places
'fire-boards,' or notices of dangerous gas, at the entrance
to headings which have been found in his examination to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
contain it. These boards should be painted red and
made easily recognisable to miners who cannot read.
Another most responsible duty of the fireman is to act as
the 'competent person ' where shots are being fired. No
shots should be fired where naked lights are used in the
vicinity, as a large volume of gas may exude or be dis-
charged after the shot and so become ignited, although
the ventilation may be ample; neither should lamps on
Davy's principle be used for the operation, but self-
extinguishing lamps, such as Stephenson's or Williamson's
safety lamps."
The advisability, or otherwise, of substituting self-
extinguishing safety lamps for those now commonly used
is a question that has agitated the mining community on
many occasions before now. Our author, however, seems
to regard it as almost a question of his own raising, and
as he takes it up with such zeal and pursues it with so
much avidity, we propose to devote a few words to its

that, according to their own showing, the Commissioners
on Accidents have stated nothing that has not been well-
known for many years, the Government could not very
well be "convinced of the folly of sanctioning the use of
Davy, Clanny, and all non-extinguishing lamps in mines,"
unless it is favoured with some new reasons for doing so
in addition to those that have failed to convince so many
generations of its predecessors. The Government could
not very well retain its dignity, and at the same time shift
its ground at the instance of every comer who thinks he
possesses the long-sought-for panacea; but there are some
eager spirits in our midst who appear to be for ever bent
upon goading it into a hare-like speed, forgetful, evi-
dently, of the moral of the fable which gives the final
victory to the more slowly travelling tortoise.
We have only one more remark to make, and then we
must conclude this already too long notice, namely, that
a book which is written ostensibly for the education and
information of even a section of the community ought not to
contain recommendations of different kinds of apparatus
which are apparently made and sold for the pecuniary

opportunities for advertising his improved and patented

OUR BOOK SHELF
Thcogonie und Astronomie. By A. Krichcnbauer.
(Vienna: Carl Konegen, 1881.)
Dr. Krichenbauer believes that he has discovered a
new key to ancient mythology. With the help of the
Iliad and Odyssey, the gods of Greece are resolved into
stars and constellations, and the facts of astronomy are
made to explain their nature and attributes, as well as
the myths that were told of them. In the deities of
Egypt, of Babylonia, of India, and of Iran, Dr. Krichen-
bauer finds fresh confirmations of his views. The deve-
lopment of this early astronomical theogony falls into two
periods, the first period being one of creation and growth,
'.he second of fixity and nationalisation. The first period
has its " climacteric " in B.C. 2110, when the Ram already
ushered in the year. But its real history belongs to that
earlier age when the Bull took the place of the Ram, and
it is the Bull, accordingly, which stands at the head of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the religious system, and breaks in sunder the egg of the
universe. The second period begins with the change of
the summer solstice from the Lion to the Crab in conse-
quence of the precession of the equinoxes, and thus
falls about 1462 B.C., when the commencement of the
year was transferred from the summer solstice to the
vernal equinox. The equal division of the path of
the sun into the twelve signs of the Zodiac took place
about seven centuries later. This, briefly put, is the
substance of Dr. Krichenbauer's work. His interpreta-
tion, however, of the passages of Homer upon which his
tbe-jry is based, is purely subjective, and is not likely to
commend itself to others. Homeric scholars, at any
rate, will not admit that any portion of the Iliad or
Odyssey is anything like so old as he would make them,
or can contain traditions of anything like so old a period.
His acquaintance, again, with the facts that modern re-
search has recovered from the monuments of Egypt and
Babylonia, is of the most meagre kind. Hence he is
quite unaware that we happen to know a good deal
about ancient Babylonian astronomy, and the history of

lastly that the present diversity of speech on the globe ad mi is of
another, a much more simple and rational explanation.
What are the facts? Col. Garrick Mallery has an interesting
paper also in last week's Nature, on Gesture Speech, in which
he tells us that there are, or were, in the United States alone
sixty-five stock languages differing from each other "asradically
as each differed from the Hebrew, Chinese, or English." And
how many more in Mexico, Central, and South America? In
Europe we have at least one still surviving, the Basque. In Asia
there are at least thirty-five or forty. But who will count the
number in the Sudan, and in the Oceanic regions occupied by
the Negrito, Papuan, and Melanesian tribes? It is no exaggeration to say that probably as many as two thousand of these stock
languages have been evolved since man first began to utter
articulate sounds.
Now if it be necessary to postulate two independent evolutions
of human speech in order to account for two independent forms
of speech, it follows that we must postulate two thousand inde-
pendent evolutions of human speech in order to account for these
two thousand independent forms of speech. Are the advocates

propose to explain the existence of fundamentally distinct
languages by the assumption of a corresponding number of inde-
pendent centres of linguistic evolution? If they draw the line
short of one or two thousand such centres, how do they propose
to meet the difficulty presented by so many separate types of
speech? Frederic Miiller left the problem just where it was
when he arbitrarily fixed the number of physical and linguistic
families at twelve.
But so marvellous is the evolution of speech, that one may
well doubt whether it occurred even so many as twelve times
ever since the appearance of man on the earth. For my part I
decline to believe that it occurred more than once, if once be
sufficient to account for the present conditions. And it is on
this ground that I take my stand. Anything short of, say, two
thousand evolutions of speech are inadequate; one suffices!
Under like conditions speech becomes differentiated far more
rapidly than physical features. The former is essentially more
or less evanescent; the latter are relatively persistent. Hence
during the many ages of man's life on the globe, his physical
type has been but slightly modified, producing mere varietiesa
black and woolly-haired, a yellow and lank-haired, a fair and
wavy-haired variety, and to on. But the primeval linguistic
type or germ has become differen'iated into varieties, species and
even genera, whence the various morphological orders of speech,
four in number, and the many now fundamentally distinct

groups and families developed within each of those morpho-
logical orders, some extinct, some dying out, some still
flourishing. The germ itself, which served as the common
starting point, but which was itself at first little more than
speech "in petto," has long been effaced past all recovery.
Hence, although starting from one common centre, it does not
follow that the linguistic families now existing can ever again be
traced back to that common centre. Aided as we are by
embryology and the fossil world, can we trace back the various
orders of plants and animals to their common centres? Yet no
evolutionist doubts that they were differentiated from such centres.
But language, although it may be said to have a sort of embryo-
logy within itself, revealing the growth of its inner structure,
leaves no fossils behind it. Its "missing links" are lost for
ever. Hence it is not surprising that, in dealing with the evolu-
tion of speech, much more must be postulated than is always
necessary in dealing with the evolution of organised life. It
follows that while Darwinism as applied to organisms may one
day be established scientifically, Darwinism as applied to lan-
guage, must always partake somewhat of the nature of a hypo-
thesis. Meanwhile I submit that, on the reasons here given,

I have been delayed hitherto in publishing my views of the

of much greater expansions in the theory before it will avail as
completely as in those important cases, to include and demonstrate
properties of specific and latent heats, and of dilatation, and the
other thermal phenomena of fusion and evaporation, and of
vapour tension, to which M. Pictet has found for his theory such
useful applications.

demonstration in a complete theory of the properties of heat, in
phases of its action where physical axioms not exactly akin to
his own fail to furnish me with sufficient explanations of them;
in the same way that it has afforded me great pleasure to offer
full corroboration of M. Pictet's views, from my own inquiries,
at a point where his theoretical hypotheses have proved insuffi-
cient to cope with an exceedingly extensive and general provision
of kinetic laws, much more comprehensive in its physical rela-

the properties and laws in ponderable matter, when it is not

the all-energising power and all-pervading agency of heat.

It is curious that a similar pump is figured in the first volume

Henry Russell; and I have always understood that a modifica-

which his lamps were filled. The patents are Gordon and

character. The observations were made on the nights of June
4, 5, and 7. The brightness of the nights at Pulkowa in the
summer had influenced unfavourably his spectroscopic observa-
vations of the great comet of 1881, and the position of Well's
Comet was also a disadvantage, so that he had not expected a
prominent spectrum, and the more because observations by Prof.
Tacchini and Dr. Vogel at the commencement of April did
not promise much. His surprise was therefore the greater on
finding a very bright and extended continuous spectrum of the
nucleus, with an excessively strong yellow line, of which the
micrc metrical measures proved the perfect identity with the
yellow line of sodium, line D of the silar spectrum. This was
a result altogether new in cometary spectroscopy, and the more
noteworthy because at the same time there were no traces of the
three ordinary bands of the spectrum. It is confirmed by Duner, Bredichin, and Vogel. In the middle of May, on the contrary,
Vogel's observations show that the three bands were then pre-
sent, though faint, while of the sodium line there was not the
least trace. It is therefore necessary to conclude that during the
last fortnight of this month the spectrum of the comet had
changed in a manner of which the history of the science furnishes
no precedent. Dr. Hasselberg then explains his views of the
modus operandi of these changes, and concludes:"Je crois,

by the expression Kmaso, or " Herd of Bears," yet to the

established between the two countries certainly before the

Since then the political ascendency has oscillated be-

hitherto preserved by the Seul government must be
mainly attributed to the rivalry of its powerful neigh-
bours.
The Korean race is commonly regarded as a branch of
the Mongolic stock. But it really seems to have resulted
from the fusion of two distinct elements, the Mongolic
and Caucasic, the former no doubt predominating. These
are probably the Sien-pi and San-han of Chinese writers,
from whose union the present inhabitants are said to have
sprung. The San-han (San-kan, or " Three Kan ") pre-
vailed in the central parts, and were apparently Mongols,

while the Sien-pi, numerous especially in the south, are,
perhaps, the above-mentioned Kmaso of the Japanese
historians, representing the fair type, whose presence is
attested by overwhelming evidence.1 These Kmaso
made frequent predatory excursions in very ancient times
to Kiusiu and Hondo, even forming permanent settle-

they also reached the Riu-kiu (Lu-Chu) archipelago, and
thus may the presence be explained of a certain fair
element in Japan itself, and especially in the Riu-kiu
group.
The Caucasic seem to have preceded the Mongol tribes
in the peninsula. But they were gradually out-numbered
and largely absorbed by the yellow stock, owing to con-
stant migrations, especially from the Chinese provinces of
Pechili and Shantung, throughout the fourth and fifth
centuries of the vulgar era. It is also to be noted, that
with every revolution or change of dynasty in China, the
leaders of the defeated party usually took refuge with
their followers in Korea. The Mongol stock was thus
continually fortified, while the stream of Caucasic migra-
tion had ceased to flow from prehistoric times. Hence it
is not surprising to find that the prevailing type is now
distinctly Mongoloid. Of the nine or ten million in-
habitants of the peninsula, probably five-sixths may be

rounded or oval features, large nose, light complexion,

intermediate shades, all of which serve to explain the

NATURE
THE COLOURS OF FLOWERS, AS ILLUS-
TRATED BY THE BRITISH FLORAE
III. Variegation and Retrogression
SO far we have spoken for the most part as though
every flower were of one unvaried hue throughout.
We must now add a few considerations on the subject of
the spots and lines which so often variegate the petals
in certain species. In this connection a hint of Mr.
Wallace is full of meaning. Everywhere in nature, he
points out, spots and eyes of colour appear on the most
highly-modified parts, and this rule applies most notice-
ably to the case of petals. Simple regular flowers, like
the buttercups and roses, hardly ever have any spots or
lines; but in very modified forms like the labiates and the
orchids they are extremely common.
Structurally speaking, the spots and lines seem to be
the direct result of high modification; but functionally,
they act as honey-guides, and for this purpose they have
no doubt undergone special selection by the proper in-
sects. The case is just analogous to that of the peacock's
plumes or the wings of butterflies. In either instance,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
the spots and eye-marks tend to appear on the most
highly-modified surfaces; but they are perpetuated and
intensified by special selective action. Lines are com-
paratively rare on regular flowers, but they tend to appear
as soon as the flower becomes even slightly bilateral, and
they point directly towards the nectaries. Hence they
cannot be mere purposeless products of special modifica-
tion; they clearly subserve a function in the economy of
the plant, and that function is the direction of the insect
towards the proper place for effecting the fertilisation of
the ovary. In the common rhodendron, the connection
can be most readily observed with the naked eye, and the
honey tested by the tongue. In this case, one lobe of the
corolla secretes a very large drop of nectar in a fold near
its base, and the lines of dark spots appear on this lobe
alone, pointing directly towards the nectariferous surface.
The Geraniacece afford an excellent illustration of the
general principle. They are on the whole a comparatively
high family of polypetals, for their ovary tends to become
compound and very complicated, and they have many
advanced devices for the dispersion of their seeds. Oxalis
corniculata, our simplest English form, is pale yellow:
O. acetosella is white, with a yellow base, and its veins are
delicately tinged with lilac. The flowers of Erodium
and Geranium, which are much more advanced, are gene-

rally pink or purplish, often marked with paler or darker
lines. For the most part, however, these regular forms
are fairly uniform in hue; but the South African Pelar-
goniums, cultivated in gardens and hot-houses, are slightly
bilateral, the two upper petals standing off from the three
lower ones; and these two become at once marked
with dark lines, which are in some cases scarcely visible,
and in others fairly pronounced. From this simple be-
ginning one can trace a gradual progress in heterogeneity
of colouring, till at last the most developed bilateral
Pelargoniums have the two upper petals of quite a dif-
ferent hue from the three lower ones, besides being deeply
marked with belts and spots of dappled colour. In the
allied Tropaolum or Indian cress (Fig. 21) this tendency
is carried still further. Here, the calyx is prolonged
into a deep spur, containing the honey, inaccessible to
any but a few large insects; and towards this spur all the
lines on the petals converge.
In most regular flowers, the lines are mere intensifica-
tions (or diminutions) of the general colouration along
the veins or ribs of the corolla; and they point towards

ferent hues than any other forms of flowers in the whole
world.
On the other hand, primitive yellow flowers of the
earliest type never have any lines or spots whatsoever.
Besides the complications introduced by variegation, we
have also to consider those introduced by retrogression.
Flowers which have reached a given stage in the pro-
gressive scale of colouration often show a tendency to fall
back to a lower stage. When this tendency is of the
nature of a mere temporary reversion (that is to say, when
it affects only a few individuals, or a casual variety), it
may conveniently be described as Relapse. When, how-
ever, it affects a whole species, and becomes fixed in the
species by a new and presumably lower adaptation, it
may best be styled Retrogression.
Primary yellow flowers, like the buttercups and poten-
tillas, show little or no tendency to vary in colour in a
state of nature. They have never passed through any
earlier stage to which they can revert; and they are not
likely to strike out a new hue for themselves.
Some white flowers, on the other hand, show a decided

tendency occasionally to revert to yellow, especially in the
simpler orders. Erysimum orientate varies from white to
pale primrose. Raphanus raphanistrum, as already noted,
is usually even lilac, often white, and on the sea-shore
yellow. The white cistuses often revert to a pale sallow
tin<*e. In some roses, the throat becomes yellow in certain
specimens. Stitchwort occurs yellow near Exeter. In

several other cases, stray yellow specimens of normally
white species are not uncommon.
Pink and red flowers almost invariably revert in many
individuals to white. A few typical instances must suffice.
All the British roses are reddish pink or white. So are
Saponaria officinalis, and many pinks. Malva moschata
runs from rose-coloured to white; Af. rotundifolia from
pale lilac-pink to whitish. Erodium cicutarium has rosy
or white petals; all the geraniums occasionally produce
very pale flowers. White varieties of heaths are frequent
in the wild state. Where the red or purple is very deeply
engrained, however, as in labiates, reversion to white
occurs less commonly. But almost all pink or red
flowers become white with the greatest readiness under
cultivation.
Blue flowers in nearly every case produce abundant

red, pink, and white varieties in a state of nature. It
would seem, indeed, as though this highest development
of colour had not yet had time thoroughly to fix itself in
the constitution of most species. Hence individual re-
version is here almost universal as an occasional incident
in every species. The columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) is
blue or dull purple, sometimes red or white. The larkspur
(Delphinium ajacis) often declines from blue to pink or
white. The monkshood (Aconitum napellus) is an ex-
tremely deep blue, very rarely white. White violets
everybody knows well. The rampions (Phyteumd) vary
from blue to white; so do many of the campanulas.
Centiana campestris is sometimes white. In most Bora-
ginecefor example, in borage, viper's bugloss, and forget-
me-notpink and white varieties are common. Pink and
white Veronicas also occur in abundance among normally
blue species. Pru?iella vulgaris occasionally produces
rosy or white blossoms. White wild hyacinths are often
gathered. Many other cases will suggest themselves to
every practical botanist.
Blue flowers, however, very seldom revert to yellow.

excellent instance of the same sort. It belongs to the
family of the Onagracew, which are highly evolved poly-
petalous plants, with the petals reduced to four or two in
number, and placed above instead of below the ovary.
We should thus naturally expect them to be pink or lilac,
and this is actually the case with most of our native
species. Why, then, is the evening primrose yellow?
Because it is a night-flowering plant, fragrant in the even-

by moths. In this case, however, two points mark it off
at once from the really primitive yellow flowers. In the
first place, it has not the bright golden petals of the but-
tercup, but is rather more of a primrose tint; and this is
a common distinguishing trait of the later acquired
yellows. In the second place, it belongs to a genus in
which red and purple flowers are common, whereas the
buttercups are almost all yellow or whitey-ycllow, and the
potentillas mostly yellow or white. In short, primitive
yellow flowers are usually golden, ar.d belong to mainly

yellow groups: reverted yellow flowers are often primrose
orange, or dull buff, and occur sporadically among blue,
red, or purple groups.
There are other cases less immediately apparent than
these. For instance, Lamium ga/eobdolon, a common
English labiate, belonging to a usually purple or blue
family, is bright yellow. But we can form some idea of
how such changes take place if we look at the pansy,
which we have seen reason to believe is normally violet-
purple, but which usually has a yellow patch on the lowest
petal. In the pansy's var. lutea, the yellow extends over
the whole flower, no doubt because this incipient form has
succeeded in attracting some special insect, or else grows
in situations where yellow proves more conspicuous to
bees than blue or purple. So, again, another English
labiate, Galeopsis tetrahit, the hemp-nettle, has a pale
purple or white corolla, sometimes with a tinge of yellow
in the throat; and in the var. versicolor, the yellow
spreads all over the flower, except a purple patch on the
lower lip. In G. ochroleuca, the whole corolla has become
pure yellow. In this way, one can understand the occur-
rence of such a flower as Lamium galeobdolon, especially
since an allied species, L. album (Fig. 23), is white, and
all the genus is extremely variable in colour. Indeed, it
is to be noted that the yellow labiates do not commonly

occur among the less developed thymes, mints, and mar-
jorams, but among the extremely specialised Stachydea,
which have very modified flowers, and usually variegated
or spotted lips. They seem to be essentially reversionary
forms from purple or blue species, spotted with yellow.
Another hint of Retrogression is given us by flowers
like our English balsams, Impatiens noli-me-tangere and
/. fulva, in the fact that their yellow is generally dappled
with numerous spots of deeper colour. The balsams are
highly modified irregular Gcraniacea?, sepals and petals
being both coloured; and at first sight it seems curious
that our species should be yellow, while the simpler Gera-
niums and Erodiums are pink or red. But the genus as
a whole contains many red and variegated species, and
alters in colour with much plasticity in the hands of gar-
deners. /. noli-me-tangere is pale yellow, spotted with
red; I. fulva is orange, dappled with deep brown. Both
are almost certainly products of retrogressive selection.
In the Primulacea, we find similar instances. Hottonia
palustris, a less developed form, is rosy lilac. Cyclamen
curopaum is white or rose-coloured. Trientalis europaet

only the ray-florets ligulate, or than the Cynaroidea:, which
have no ligulate florets at all. Hence we should naturally
expect them to be blue or purple, whereas they are for the
most part yellow of a very primitive golden type, while
the ray-florets of the Corymbifers are usually white or
pink, and all the florets of the Cynaroids are usually
purple. The following hypothetical explanation is sug-
gested as a possible way out of this difficulty.
The primitive ancestral composite had reached the
stage of blue or purple flowers while it was still at a level
of development corresponding to that of the scabious or
Jasione. The universality of such colours among the
closely allied Dipsacea, Valerianea, Lobcliacea, and
Campanulacea, adds strength to this supposition. The
central and most primitive group of composites, the
Cynaroids, has kept up the original colouration to the
present day; it includes most of the largest forms, such
as the artichoke, and it depends most of any for fertilisa-
tion upon the higher insects. All our British species
(except the degenerate Carlind) are purple, sometimes
reverting to pale pink or white, while Centaurea cyanus (Fig. 25), our most advanced representative of the tribe,

the Corymbifers, some of which have begun to develop
outer ligulate rays. Here the least evolved type, Eupa-
torium, with few and relatively large florets, is usually
purple or white, never yellow. But as the florets grew
smaller, and began to bid for the favour of many miscel-
laneous small insects, reversion to yellow became general.
In a few cases here and there we still find purple or white
central florets, as in Petasites vulgaris, the butter-bur;
but even then we get closely related forms, like Tussilago
farfara, colts-foot, which have declined to yellow. The
smallest and most debased species, such as Solidago
virga-aurea, golden rod, Tanacetum vnlgare, tansy, and
Senecio vulgaris, groundsel, have all their florets yellow
and similar; unless, indeed, like Gnaphalium and Filago,
cud-weed, Artemisia absinthium, wormwood, or Xan-
t/iium struntarium, burweed, they have declined as far as
colourless or green florets, in which case they must be
considered under our next head, that of Degeneration.
On the other hand, the larger and better types of Corym-
bifers began a fresh progressive development of their
own. In many Senecios, Inulas, Chrysanthemums, they
produced yellow ray florets, similar in colour to those of
the disk. In Chrysanthemum leucanthemum, Anthemis

cotula, Matricaria inodora, &c, these rays, under the
influence of a different type of insect selection, became
white. In the daisy they begin show signs of pink, and
in the Asters, Cinerarias, &c, they become lilac, purple,
and blue. Complicated as these changes seem, they must
yet have taken place two or three times separately in
various groups of Corymbifers, for example, in the
Asteroidece, the Anthemidca, and the Scnecionida.
The Ligulates were again developed from yellow-rayed
Corymbifers by the conversion of all the disk florets into
rays. Appealing for the most part to very large and varied
classes of miscellaneous insects, they have usually kept
their yellow colour (Fig. 26); but in a few cases a fresh pro-
gressive development has been set up, producing the
violet-blue or purple florets of the salsify (Tragopogon
porri/olius), the deep blue Sonchus alpinus, and the bright
mauve succory, Cichorium intybus. As a whole, however,
the Ligulates are characterised by what seems a primitive
golden yellow, only occasionally rising to orange-red or
primrose in a few hawkweeds.

numerous instances the larger blossoms of each family
are so exclusively adapted to insect fertilisation that they
cannot fertilise themselves; while among the smaller
blossoms alternative devices for self-fertilisation com-
monly come into play after the flower has been open for
some time, if it has not first been cross-fertilised. Struc-
tural considerations show us that in most of such instances
the larger and purely entomophilous flowers are the more
primitive, while the smaller and occasionally self-fertilising
flowers are derivative and degraded, having usually lost
some or their parts. Hence, in tracing the progressive
law of colouration in the families generally, it is necessary,
for the most part, to consider only the larger and more
typical species, setting aside most of the smaller as

NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF OPTICAL GLASS
A/1" FEIL has been good enough to send us thefollow-
r ing interesting particulars of the life of Pierre Louis Guinaud :
Pierre Louis Guinaud was born at Bresset in the canton
of Neuchatel, Switzerland, in 1742, and died in 1821.

He was nearly sixteen years old when Herschel visited
Switzerland, and with Alschneider made some telescopic
experiments on the Tete Doran. Young Guinaud, who
acted as shepherd by day, and at night worked in a bell
manufactory, occasionally was present at the meetings of
these gentlemen, and attracted their attention and good
will by many services.
His curiosity was greatly aroused, and after having
been allowed to look through the telescope, he asked
Herschel to dismount the instrument, as he wished to see how it was made; doubtless struck by his wonderful
intelligence, the illustrious savant showed him the details
of its construction.
The following year this gentlemen returned to Switzer-
land with Dollond and Faraday. Young Guinaud must
have utilised the intervening time, for he showed Herschel,
whom he was able to call his benefactor, a telescope
which he himself had made, the mirror being of bell-
metal. Imperfect as such an instrument must neces-
sarily have been, it proved his strength of will and
aptitude for optics.
He had pondered over the subject and asked why
large object-glasses had not been made? There are no
glasses in existence suitable to make them," was the
answer. "Make some, if you can," said Alschneider.
"I will make some," replied Guinaud. But he required

money. He set to work, and, being a clever workman,
soon invented the bells of repeaters, which proved
very lucrative. All that he earned was devoted to the
establishment of small glass-works. What power of
research and perseverance must this man have possessed,
who, without any other resource but his genius, started
the most difficult branch of glass making, in order to
solve a problem which was incomprehensible to Faraday
and Dartigercs? For ten years everything was devoted
to his work. One casting failed, and was thrown into
the torrent which flowed at the foot of the mountain on
which he had built his factory. He had chosen the
highest and most inaccessible point, having to defend
himself against the ignorance of his neighbours, who
treated him as a sorcerer, and several times his place was
sacked. He utilised a stream of water in order to work a
hydraulic wheel for the pulverisation of these materials,
the sawing and working up of these blocks of glass.
Nevertheless, the attention of the scientific world was
already drawn to the modest worker. Alschneider
had become his friend. About 1806 he sold a disc

The Astronomical and Meteorological Bulletin of the Obser-

solar image was thrown on a screen which had a series of parallel
lines directed perpendicularly to the diurnal motion. The pas-
sages of the sun's border over those lines were recorded in a
chronograph. Each of the tables (referring to one day's obser-
vations) gives the angle of position of the solar equator reckoned
from north towards east, the angle, north or south of the solar
equator, which the diameter mea-ured makes with the latter,
the radius vector of the earth's orbit, and the sun's declination.

A curious and little-known experiment, showing the resist-
ance of the air in guns, is described by Prof. Daniel Colladon,
of Geneva, in a recent letter to M. Melsens {Bull. Btlg. Acad.
No. 6). He was long in the habit of showing it to his classes.
It resembles a feat that was sometimes performed by soldiers
with the old Swiss carbines. M. Colladon fully charged with
compressed air the hollow iron breech of an air-gun, serving as
reservoir. Having screwed up the gun, he introduced a round
lead ball, running freely, but nearly filling the bore; then,
placing the gun vertical, he seized the upper end and pressed his
thumb vigorously on the mouth. The gun was then "fired" by
an assistant; the thumb remained in position, and the ball was
heard to fall back in the bore. Thereupon, after recharging the
breech and with the same ball, he shot the latter at a pine board
about "4 in. thick, or a pane of glass, and it passed through.
The experiment, M. Colladon says, is without danger, if the
operator is sure of the strength of his thumb, if the gun is more
than 32 in. long, and if the ball is spherical and nearly fills the

gun (in which it must act like a piston). The least uncertainty
in the very vigorous pressure of the thumb, and hermetic closure
of the gun, may entail serious injury to the thumb. While
M. Colladon has repeated the experiment twenty or thirty times,
without the least inconvenience either from shock or heat, a
trial of it is perhaps hardly to be recommended.

weeds, and Hawkweeds, all showing excito-conlractility in the
same way, although the plants do not at all resemble each other
in external appearance. In order to make you acquainted with
the mechanism by which the excitable motions of plants are
brought about, I will confine myself to a very few examples,
selecting, of course, those which have been most carefully
investigated.
Every one is acquainted with the general aspect of the sensi-
tive plant. Probably, also, most persons have observed the way
in which the leaves behave when one of them is touched, namely,
that the leaf, instead of being directed upwards, suddenly falls, as if
it had lost its power of supporting itself, and that the little leaflets
which spring from the side stalks fold together upwards (Fig. 1).
But perhaps every one has not observed exactly how this motion
is accomplished, namely, that by means of little cylindrical
organs the leaflets are jointed on to side-stalks, the side-stalk on
to the principal stalk, and the principal stalk on to the stem. In
those little cylinders, the powers of motion of the leaf have their
seat. They may, therefore, be called the motor organs of
Mimosa. I would ask your attention to their structure.

(after Pfeffer).
In my description I will confine myself to the relatively large
joint at the base of the principal leaf-stalk. If you make a
section through it in the direction of its length, you find that it
consists of the following parts. In the axis of the cylinder is a
fibro-vascular bundle; above it are numerous layers of roundish
cells with thick walls, and between these there exist everywhere
intercellular spaces, which in the restingthat is the excitable
state of the organ, are filled with air. The surface is covered by
epidermis, below the axial bundle there are equally numerous
layers of cells, but they differ from them in this respect, that
their walls are more delicate (Fig. 2). And now let us study the
mechanism of the motion. The literature of this subject is
voluminous. Substantially, however, we owe the knowledge
we possess to two observersE. Briicke, awho studied it in 1848,
BrOcke,
p utile a.'
M tiller's
and Pfeffer,1 whose work appeared in 1873. I must content
myself with the most rapid summary.
Let me begin by noticing that Mimosa, in common with many
other excitable plants, exhibits that remarkable phenomenon
which we commonly call the sleep of plants, that is, that as
night approaches the leaf-stalks sink, and the leaflets fold up,
the whole leaf assuming a position closely resembling that which
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
it assumes when it is irritated. All that time will allow me to
say on this subject is that although the leaf assumes the same
position in sleep as after excitation, the two effects are not
identical. The state of sleep differs from that in which the
plant finds itself after it has been irritated in two particulars.
The first is, that in the state of sleep it is still excitable, and
responds to stimulation exactly in the same way, although from
being already depressed the extent of its motion is diminished;
the other is, that in sleep, the joint, although bent downwards, is
still more or less resistent and elastic; whereas in the unexcitable
(or, what comes to the same thing excited) sta'e, all elasticity has
disappeared. In a word, in the motor organ of Mimosa, in
common with all other excitable structures, the characteristic of
the excited state is limpness. All the Mimosa plants on the
table are in the state ot sleep, but are still excitable, for when
they are touched they sink to an even lower position than that
of sleep, and at the same time become limp. Hence you have,
as the result of excitation, two change-', namely (1), the change
of position, only to be observed when the plant is awake, and
(2) the loss of stiffness, dependent, as we shall see, on a vital
change in the protoplasm of the cells, which is also observed

bladders, each of which is distended with liquid. And its ten-
dency to expand as a whole is due to the tendency to expand of
the innumerable cells of which it is made up. In the unmu-
tilated state these are squeezed into a smaller spice than that
which they would assume if they were left to themselves; and,
consequently, as their expansion is prevented, or curbed on one
side, it acts on the opposite side, so as to bend the cylinder in
the direction of the restraint.
All of this we can, perhaps, better understand by a model;
and it is possible to make one which, not only in form but in
principle, corresponds to the living mechanism it is intended to
illustrate. In the model the axial bundle is represented by a
strip of leather, the innumerable cells of the excitable cushion by
an india rubber bag. By a pump uc are able to fill this cell or
cushion more or less with fluid, and thus to vary its tension, and
you see that if we increase the tension, the stem rises. By
diminution it suddenly falls, just as the Mimosa leaf does when
irritated.
We have come then to this pointthat the reason why the
leaf suddenly [sinks on excitation is that the cells undergo a
sudden diminution of tension or expansion. But our inquiry is
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
not yet terminated. We have still to ask, How is this loss of
tension effected? The answer is, by discharge of water. In the
unexcited state all these cells are distended or charged with
liquid. Suddenly, when the structure is excited, they let out or
discharge that liquid, and it find-; its way first into the inter-
cellular air space-, and secondly, out of the motor organ alto-
gether. This we know to be a fact by an experiment of Pfirffer's,
which must be regarded as one of the most important relating to
the mechanism of plants that was ever made. He observed that
if the leafstalk is cut off from the motor organ, a drop of fluid
appears at the cut surface at the moment that the latter bends
downwards on excitation, and that in the experiment described
just now, in which the upper part of the motor organ is cut off,
there is also, so to speak, a sweating of liquid from the cut
surface.
Wc are therefore certain that liquid escapes, but why does it
escape? That I shall explain further on, and will now proceed
to two other examples. One is a plant which is a great favourite
in London, for it is one which flourishes even in London smoke
Mimulus. For our purpose it is good chiefly becau-e its
structure is very simple. It is one of those examples in which
excitability is associated with the function of fertilisation, and
inasmuch as this is a very transitory purpose, the property itself
is transitory. When the cells of the stigmatic .'¦urface are touched
they discharge their liquid contents, and consequently be-'.ome

limp. The outer layer of the Hd is elastic, and tends to bend
inwards. Consequently when the inner cells lose their elastic
resilience it i* able to act, and the lip bends inwards. In another
allied plant, Goldfussia anisophylla (Fig. 3), which was described
forty years ago by the Belgi n naturalist Morren, we have the same
mechanism. In this plant, as shown in the drawing, the style
is not lipped but awl-shaped. It reaches to the mouth of tre
showy, orange-coloured corolla, to the inside of which it is
united by its under surface. It has a smooth side, the epidermis
of which is made up of numerous small prismatic cells, and is
very elastic, and in the unexcited state concave, and a papillated
side beset «ith the nipple-like ends of cylindrical cells, which,
when unexcited, are distended with liquid. These cylindrical
cells are continuous w ith those of the conducting tissue of the
style. When an insect enters the flower, it does two things: it
charges the fringe of hairs on the inside of the corolla with
pollen, and touches the style, which, in consequence, bends
suddenly in the opposite di-ection to that in which it was bent
before, so as to plunge its stigmatic surface into the fringe. In
this motion the epidermis acts as a spring simply. So long as
the stigmatic tissue is turgid it cannot act. The moment its cells

(Fig. 5). The large diagram shows the same floret deprived of
its corolla. Its axis is occupied by the style, surrounded by its
tube of anthers. Below, the anther-filaments expand into a kind
of cage, and again approach one another, when they are united
with the tube of the corolla. At the moment that the anthers
arrive at maturity these filaments are very excitable. When one
of them is touched, it contracts and draws the style towards
itself. Immediately afterwards the excitatory effect spreads to
the others, all five arches becoming straight, and applying them-
selves closely to the style. A similar effect is produced by an
induction shock. [The structure described was projected on the

contraction of the filaments was seen.]
The mechanism of Centaurca has been studied by many plant
physiologists, particularly by Prof. Ferdinand Cohn of Kreslau,
and more recently with great completeness by I'rof. Pfeffer. It
has in this respect a greater interest than any otherthat the
shortening of these filaments in response to excitation strikingly
resembles muscular contraction. You hive here a structure in
the form of a flattened cylinder which resembles many muscles
in form, the length of which is diminished by about a sixth on
excitation. This superficial resemblance between the two actions
makes it the more easy to appreciate the differences.
Let me draw your attention to the diagram of an experiment
made last year, which was intended to illustrate the nature of
muscular contraction, and particularly to show that when a
muscle contracts, it does not diminish in volume. The first
difference between muscle and plant is a difference in the degree
of shortening. A muscle shortens by something like a third of
its length, the anther filament only by a sixth. But it is much
more important to notice.that in contracting, the filaments do
not retain thtir volume. In shortening they broaden, but the
broadening is scarcely measurable; hence they must necessarily
diminish in bulk, and this shrinkage takes place, as Pfeffer has
shown, exactly in the same manner as that in which the excitable
cushion of Mimosa shrinks, namely by the discharge of liquid
from its cells.

We are now in a position to study more closely the question
to which I referred a few minutes agoHow do the cells dis-
charge their contents? The structure of the filament of
Centaurea, from its extreme simplicity, is a better subject of
investigation with reference to this question, than any other.
Each filament is a ribbon consisting of (1) a single fihro-vascular
bundle, (2) delicate cells of regular cylindrical form, (3) an
epidermis of somewhat thick walled cells. [Microscopical pre-
parations were shown.] In Mimosa we saw that the epidermis
and vascular bundle took only a passive part in the production
of the motion. Here, the part they play is even less important.
Everything depends on the parenchyma, which, when excited,
shrinks by discharging its water. Pfeffer proved this by cutting
off the anther tube from the filaments, and then observing that
on excitation a drop collected on the cut surface, which was
reabsorbed as the filament again became arched. It is obvious
that if the whole parenchyma discharges its liquid, each cell
must do the same, for it is made up entirely of cells. To un-
derstand how each cell acts, we have only to consider its struc-
ture. Each consists of two partsan external sac or vesicle,
which is of cellulose, and, so long as the cell is in the natural or

NA TURE
The experiment I have just shown illustrates the principle of
electric lighting by incandescence, which is briefly thisthat a
state of white Mat may be produced in a continuous solid con-
ductor bypassing a sufficiently strong electrical current througk it.
A principle, the importance of which cannot well be over-
estimated, underlies this method of producing light electrically
namely, the principle of divisibility. By means of electric in-
candescence it is possible to produce exceedingly small centres
of light, even so small as the light of a single candle; and with
no greater expenditure of power in proportion to the light pro-
duced, than is involved in the maintenance of light-centres 10
or ICO times greater. Given a certain kind of wire, for
example a platinum wire, the 100th of an inch in diameter,
a certain quantity of current would make this wire white-hot
whatever its length. If in one case the wire were one inch long
and in another case ten inches long, the same current passing
through these two pieces of similar wire, would heat both to
precisely the same temperature. But in order to force the same
current through the ten times longer piece, ten times the electro-
motive force, or, if I may be allowed the expression, electrical
pressure, is required, and exactly ten times the amount of energy
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
would be expended in producing this increased electro-motive
force.
Considering, therefore, the proportion between power applied
and light produced, there is neither gain nor loss in heating
these different lengths of wire. In the case of the longer wire,
as it had ten times the extent of surface, ten times more light
was radiated from it than from the shorter wire, and that is
exactly equivalent to the proportional amount of power ab-
sorbed. It is therefore evident that whether a short piece of wire
or a long piece is electrically heated, the amount of light pro-
duced is exactly proportional to the power expended in pro-
ducing it.
This is extremely important; for not only does it make it
possible to produce a small light where a small light is required,
without having to pay for it at a higher rate than for a larger
light, but it gives alsithe great advantage of obtaining eijual dis-
tribution of light. As the illuminating effect of light is inversely
as the square of the distance of its source, it follows that where
a large space is to be lighted, if the lighting is accomplished by-
means of centres of light of great power, a much larger total
quantity of light has to be employed, in order to make the
spaces remotest from these centres sufficiently light, than would
be required if the illumination of the space were obtained by
numerous smaller lights equally distributed.
In order to practically apply the principle of producing light

by the incandescence of an electrically heated continuous solid
conductor, it is necessary to select for the light-giving body a
material which offers a considerable resistance to the passage of
the electric current, and which is also capable of bearing an
exceedingly high temperature without undergoing fusion or other
change.
As an illustration of the difference that exists among different
substances in respect of resistance to the flow of an electric
current, and consequent tendency to become heated in the act of
electrical transmision, here is a wire formed in alternate sections
of platinum and silver; the wire'is perfectly uniform in diameter,
and when I pass an electric current through it, although the
current is uniform in every part, yet, as you see, the wire is not
uuiformly hot, but white-hot only in parts. The white-hot sec-
tions are platinum, the dark sections are silver. Platinum offers
a higher degree of re-istance to the passage of the electric
current than silver, and in consequence of this, more heat is
developed in the platinum than in the silver sections.
The high electrical resistance o f platinum, and its high
melting-point, mark it out as one of the most likely of the
metals to be useful in the construction of incandescent lamps.

eally sealed glass ball, perfectly exhausted, the filament suffers no
apparent change even when heated to an extreme degree of white-
ness. This result was reached in 1878. It has since then become
clearly evident that Mr. Edison had the same idea and reached
the same conclusion as Mr. Stearn and myself.
A necessary condition of the higher vacuum was the simplifica-
tion of the lamp. In its construction there must be as little as
possible of any material, and there must be none of such material
as could occlude gas, which being eventually given out would
spoil the vacuum. There must besides be no joints except those
made by the glass-blower.
Therefore, naturally and per force of circumstances, the incan-
descent carbon lamp took the most elementary form, resolving
itself into a simple bulb, pierced by two platinum wires supporting
a filament of carbon. Probably the first lamp, having this ele-
mentary character, ever publicly exhibited, was shown in opera-
tion at a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
Newcastle in February, 1879. The vacuum had been produced
by Mr. Stearn by means of an improved Sprengel pump of his
invention.

carbons, had been such invariable accompaniments of the old
conditions of imperfect vacua, and of imperfect contact between
carbon and conducting wires, as to have led to the conclusion
that the carbon was volatilised. But under the new conditions
these faults entirely disappeared ; and carefully conducted expe-
riments have shown that well-made lamps are quite serviceable
after more than a thousand hours' continual use.
Here are some specimens of the latest and most perfected
forms of lamp. The mode of attaching the filament to the
conducting wires by means of a tiny tube of platinum, and
also the improved form of the lamp, are due to the skill of Mr.
Gimmingham.
The lamp is easily attached and detached from the socket
which connects it with the conducting wires ; and can be adapted
to a great variety of fittings, and these may be provided with
switches or taps for lighting or extinguishing the lamps. I have
here a lamp fitted especially for use in mines. The current may be supplied either through main wires from a dynamo-electrical machine, with flexible branch wires to the lamp, or it may be fed
by a set of portable store cells closely connected with it. I will
give you an illustration of the quality of the light these incan-
descent lamps are capable of producing by turning the current
from a Siemens' dynamo-electric machine (which is working by
means of a gas engine in the basement of the building) through
sixty lamps ranged round the front of the gallery and through
six on the table. (The theatre was now completely illuminated
by means of the lamps, the gas being turned off during the rest

of the lecture.)
It is evident by the appearance of the flowers on the table that
colours are seen very truly by this light, and this is suggestive of
its suitability for the lighting of pictures.
The heat produced is comparatively very small; and of course
there are no noxious vapours.
And now I may, I think, fairly say that the difficulties
encountered in the construction of incandescent electric lamps
have been completely conquered, and that their use is economi-
cally practicable. In making this statement I mean, that, both
as regards the cost of the lamp itself and the cost of supplying
electricity to illuminate it, light can be produced at a cost which
will compare not unfavourably with the cost of gas light. It is
evident that if this opinion can be sustained, lighting by elec-
tricity at once assumes a position of the widest public interest,
and of the greatest economic importance; and in view of this, I
may be permitted to enter with some detail into a consideration
of the facts which support it.
There has now been sufficient experience in the manufacture of
lamps to leave no doubt that they can be cheaply constructed,
and we know by actual experiment that continuous heating to a

power is available, electric lighting is in a position of still
greater advantage, and, in point of cost, altogether beyond
comparison with other means of producing light.
To complete the comparison between the cost of electric light
and gas light, we must consider not only the amount of coal
required to yield a certain product of light in the one case and in
the other, but also the cost of converting the coal into electric
current and into gas; that is to say, the cost of manu-
facture of electricity and the cost of manufacture of gas. I
cannot speak with the same exactness of detail on this point as I
did on the comparative cost of the raw material. But if you
consider the nature of the process of gas manufacture, and that
it is a process, in so far as the lifting of coal by manual labour is
concerned, not very unlike the stoking of a steam boiler, and if
electricity is generated by means of steam, then the manual
labour chiefly involved in both processes is not unlike. It is
evident that in gas manufacture it would be necessary to shovel
into the furnaces and retorts five or six times as much coal to
yield the same light product as would be obtainable through the
steam engine and incandescent lamps. But here again it is
necessary to allow for the value of the labour in connection with
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
the products other than gas, and hence it is right to cut down
the difference I have mentioned to halfi.e. debit gas with only
half the cost of manufacture, in the same way as in our calcula-
tion we have charged gas with only one-half the coal actually
used. But when that is done there is still a difference of pro-
bably three to one in respect of labour in favour of electric
lighting.
I have made these large allowances of material and labour in
favour of the cost of gas, but it is well known that the bye
products are but rarely of the value I have assumed. I desire,
however, to allow all that can he claimed for gas.
With regard to the COST OF PLANT, I think there will be a
more even balance in the two cases. In a gasworks you have
retorts and furnaces, purifying chambers and gasometers, engines,
boilers, and appliances for distributing the gas and regulating
its pressure. Plant for generating electricity on a large scale
would consist principally of boilers, steam-engines, dynamo-
electric machines, and batteries for storage.
No such electrical station, on the scale and in the complete
form I am supposing, has yet been put into actual operation;
but several small stations for the manufacture of electricity
already exist in England, and a large station designed by Mr.
Edison is, if I am rightly informed, almost completed in
America. We are therefore on the point of ascertaining by
actual experience, what the cost of the works for generating
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
electricity will be. Meanwhile, we know precisely the cost of
boilers and engines, and we know approximately wiat ought to
be the cost of dynamo-electric machines of suiiably large size.
We have, therefore, sufficient grounds for concluding that to
produce a given quantity of light electrically the cost of plant
would not exceed greatly, if at all, the cost of equivalent gas-
plant.
There remains to be considered, in connection with this part
of the subject, the cost of distribution. Can electricity be distri-
buted as widely and cheaply as gas? On one condition, which
I fully hope can be complied with, this may be answered in the
affirmative. The condition is that it may be found practicable
and safe to distribute electricity of comparatively high tension.
The importance of this condition will be understood when it
is remembered that to effectively utilise electricity in the produc-
tion of light in the manner I have been explaining, it is necessary
that the resistance in the carbon of the lamps should be relatively
gTeat to the resistance in the wires which convey the current to
them. When lamps are so united with the conducting wire, that
the current which it conveys is divided amongst them, you have
a condition of things in which the aggregate resistance of the

THE LIFE OF IMMANUEL KANT
The Life of Immanuel Kant. By J. H. W. Stuckenberg,

relation to scientific method.
Dr. Stuckenberg's book is of an order different from
that of Prof. Max Miiller's book. It has no pretensions
to brilliance, nor does it attempt to reproduce the system
of the thinker whose life forms its subject. It is a plain
book, written for such plain people as are content to hear
what sort of man Kant was without learning much of his
teaching. But its plainness notwithstanding, it is a very
useful work, abounding as it does in facts and common
sense. No one can read it and continue to go about his
business with the old impression that Kant was a meta-
physical dreamer of that a priori school which found its
apotheosis in Hegel as popularly conceived. We learn

from Dr. Stuckenberg's pages, what ought to be much
better understood than is currently the case, that Kant
was an inquirer into the facts of nature, who was forced
by the difficulties which presented themselves in his
generalisations to investigate the constitution of experi-
ence itself. And we have material sufficient to enable us
to gather that Kant's method in his criticism of knowledge
was precisely the same as his method in his earlier criti-
cism of nature. It is perhaps not to be wondered at that
philosophy should since 184S have fallen into bad repute.
But it is to be wondered at, that with two or three excep-
tions, the English exponents of the sort of philosophy
which is most in favour among educated men in this
country, should know so little about the teaching of the
great successor of Hume, a teacher whose criticisms have
a greater and more important bearing upon the question
of method than have those of Hume himself.
Apart from his work in philosophy and in mathematical
physics and astronomy, the life of Kant is of peculiar
interest in itself. He contributed largely to the bringing
about of that revolution in literature which was carried to
its consequences by Herder and Lessing, and which
culminated in Goethe. He probably did more than any
other maneven than Goetheto give to Germany the
intellectual position which she held in the early years of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
this century. But just because Kant's work was never of
an order readily intelligible to ordinarily educated men,
he remains to this day for the most part merely a great
personality about whose thoughts little is known. What
Kant was, as distinguished from what he did, will at least
be collected from the pages of Dr. Stuckenberg.
It is open to doubt whether there is any idea about
which educated people deceive themselves more than the
supposed distinction between the " high a priori" method
of philosophy and the experimental method of science.
The methods of science and philosophy are really indis-
tinguishable. They consist simply in the application of
a previously conceived hypothesis to a given state of facts
Vol. xxvi.No. 668
and the acceptation or rejection of the hypothesis accord-
ing as it is or is not in harmony with these facts and
adequate to their explanation. The exact sciences are
distinguished from other sciences by the possibility of

and adequacy in part at least by measurement. But

approaching the consideration of all such problems with
a new light and an increasing disposition to limit the
field of inquiry. He will also see that much that he took
to relate to problems of the nature of objects within ex-
perience, really relates to the problem of experience itself.
And he will probably agree with Kant in thinking that
the difficulty of investigating this special problem is a
difficulty not of kind but of degree, and this whether his
conclusions are those of Kant or none at all. Just at
present, when the tendencies of science are increasingly
in the direction of general conceptions, it is difficult to
avoid feeling that some knowledge of what Kant really
taught ought to be far more widely diffused among
scientific men than is actually the case.

U rious works on ornithological literature which have
flowed from his pen during the last ten years. No fact
seems too trivial for record, no labour too great for this
author when once he sets his mind to exhaust the literary
history of any group of birds, or the ornithological fauna
of a country. We have just received a copy of his second
Check List of North American Birds, which appears to
us to be much the most complete work of its kind which
has yet appeared. An entire list of the Birds of North
America, as politically defined, is here given, and we
perceive that the number of recorded species has increased
from 283 in 1814 (Wilson) to 888 in the present volume.
Mr. Ridgway's estimate in 1880 was 924, but this total is
reached by including in the North American List several
species which are found in Mexico, as well as in the
islands of Socorro and Guadeloupe. Dr. Coues considers
that there are not more than thirty out of his 888 species "whose claims to be recognised by sub-specific names

melanocephalus. The system too appears to us likely to
bolster up sub-species and races which are not entitled to
such recognition, as, for instance, in the case of the com-

placed the ornithology of Japan on such a satisfactory

wood, 1882.)
THE most prominentwe ought perhaps to say, the one
redeemingfeature of Mr. Coles's work is the fact
that he occupied himself by taking observations of heights,
temperatures, distances, and magnetic variations while
travelling in Iceland. This is rarely done because of the
difficulty of carrying instruments over a very rough, and
in some places pathless, country. The result has been
that the map appended to "Summer Travelling " is per-
haps the most accurate which has yet appeared. Mount
Paul, and a few more-familiar names, are strangely
enough not inserted, but, on the other hand, the heights
of the principal mountains and highlands are given in
English feet; the crater of Askja is shown of its proper
form; and the details of the Sprengisandr route are
mapped. At the same time, the map is not so clear as
that of Gunnlaugsson, who was careful to indicate the
different surface soilslava, sand, heath, &c.by differ-
ences both of shading and of colour. If those who travel
in a little-known country would provide themselves with
a good aneroid, compass, and thermometer, and would
learn before starting how to use them, and maintain a
habit of using them constantly while on their travels, like

Mr. Coles, it would be to the great advantage of science.
According to Mr. Coles, the magnttic variation in the
extreme west of Iceland is 430 W., while on the east
coast it is 340 W., and the compass error in different parts
of the islands will thus vary by three-quarters of a point.
Thus in the W. of the island the compass box must
be turned until the N. end of the magnetic needle is over
N.W., while in the E. of the island the N. end would re-
quire to be placed over N.W. by N., and then all the
points marked on the card would indicate true bearings.
We may mention also a capital plan of the Haukadalr
Geysirs, better, we believe, than any one which has
appeared since that of Baring Gould.
Apart from the observations, the book contains nothing
which is new to Icelandic travellers, or to those acquainted
with the literature relating to travel in that country. The
description of the Thingvellir-Geysir-Hekla-Krisuvik route,
is as old as the hills, and becomes infinitely wearisome
from much repetition. Four chapters out of eleven take
us only as far as Hekla, and then the author did not ascend
it. The journey across the Sprengisandr was quite un-

majority of visitors gather their impressions of Madeira
from a limited halt in the Bay of Funchal, or from a
winter sojourn on its south side, yet fine as its coast line
and peaks are seen to be, they are no more comparable
to the grandeur of the northern side than the cultivated
banks of the Rhine are to the gorges of the Yosemite.
The south side is almost destitute of forest growth, except
the introduced sweet chestnut, oak, and maritime pine,
for the native juniper and dragon trees are almost extinct,
but in crossing the dividing ridge another world is
entered. Here all but the highest peaks are clothed with
densest virgin forest. The naturalist may penetrate at
will the wildest gorges, for the only paths into their re-
cesses are the beds of half dried torrents.
The common distinctive feature of all these gorges is
the precipitous nature of their sides, which time seems not
yet to have weathered into angles of repose. The verticality
is everywhere appalling, yet giant evergreens cling to every
nook and crowd on every terrace. Some of the laurel
tribe reach immense girth, and are quite inaccessible to

The warm, moist, and shady valleys form a paradise for
ferns, the Dicksonia, Woodwardia, and Asplenium rival-
ling each other in size. The botany of the island is of
great interest, especially in its relations to that of Europe
and Africa; but the visible fauna, except Mollusca, is
meagre, and the comparative absence of birds and butter-
flies is felt. Beyond the foreground of vast walls of red
and brown rock, often 3000 to 4000 feet high, clothed
and softened by dark green foliage, are peaks weathered
into most fantastic forms, and rising to 6000 feet. But if
this grand scenery could become monotonous, there are
English moorlands on the Paul da Serra, barren tracts of
rock at the extremities of the island, cultivated country
with lanes hedged by fuchsias and hydrangeas at Ca-
macha. The coast-line is magnificent in the extreme, one
headland on the south presenting a vertical cliff to the sea
of 2000 feet, and another, a mountain clothed with myrtle
on the north, being scarcely inferior to it. The ascent of
some of the peaks might tax even an experienced Alpine
climber's nerves; but the effect of ocean rising to the
skies like a blue wall all round is very striking when seen
for the first time from a lofty island peak. In summer the
heat is not oppressive among the mountains, and now that
the fares are no longer unreasonable, one with an overtaxed

brain seeking rest might make a worse choice than Madeira
for a ramble. To him Miss Taylor's exhaustive book is
inexhaustible, and the itineraries in it, sketched by Mr.
Charles Cossart, invaluable.
No mention of Madeira is complete without allusion to
its staple producewine. The export seems never to
have exceeded 20,000 pipes annually, and though this was
reached as early as 1750, yet this is far below the pro-
ducing power of the island. The vines, destroyed by
Oideum, have again severely suffered from Phylloxera, but
the shipments, owing chiefly to the persistent efforts of
Messrs. Cossart GorJon, are steadily recovering. It can-
not be too widely known that Madeira is a pure wine, for
at the price of grapes there, there is no incentive to use
anything but grape juice in its production, though Madeira
is exported to other wine countries, presumably for manu-
facture into sherry. The retail price is only artificially
maintained by a pretended scarcity.

Francis Maitland Balfour
The memoir of Prof. Francis M. Balfour, published in
Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 313, appears to have been founded, as
far as his life at Harrow is concerned, on incomplete informa-
tion; and I therefore ask your permission to supplement it with
my own remini-cences.
He entered Harrow School in January, 1865, and when he
had reached the upper part of the fifth form in 1867, I was
appointed to give induction in natural science. Although this
subject was not taught in any of the forms which Balfour passed
through, he soon afterwards eagerly availed himself of the
opportunity offered of taking lessons in practical work in biology.
This continued without intermission until he left the school for
Cambridge more than three years afterwards. He was always
ready to spend as many hours as I could give him for work with
the microscope and in making dissections. With Dr. Kolleston's
"Forms of Animal Life" as guide, he dissected nearly all the
typical examples described in that book. In the same way he
gained a knowledge of osteology, using a small collection of
skeletons which received, for his special benefit, the important
additions of a complete crocodile, and an armadillo, several
incomplete skeletons of ornithorhynchus, and echidna. No part
of comparative anatomy was neglected, but of such an extensive
subject, much of his knowledge was necessarily derived from

books only, but it was sound, being based on Huxley, Miiller,
Kblliker, and the like. He had the opportunity also of learning
elementary botany.
All this work was carried on under conditions with which
only a boy of his energy and indomitable \ erseverance could
have coped. At first he had some difficulty in acquiring skill in
the purely mechanical details of dissection, but he determined to
overcome this difficulty, and he succeeded. The time at his
disposal for biology was chiefly the half-holidays, and for such
work no marks could be given by bis form masters, but on the
contrary, it is only too certain thai his position in other subjects
was affected by his devotion to natural science.
Those who managed the affairs of the School Scientific Society
in 1868 (two years before Balfour left Harrow), showed their
appreciation of his remarkable powers by asking Prof. Huxley
to award the prize, which had been offered, through the libe-
rality of Mr. C. J. Leaf, for the best essay written during the
previous holidays, being a description of some district known to
the author. This unusual step was taken when it was found
that the essay sent in by Balfour and another by his friend A. J.

the temperance demonstrations which take place on Friday
evenings. It is hooed that an interest in such matters may be
awakened in the audience (usually numbering ten or twelve
hundred, or during the winter more than this), which assembles
at these demonstrations. It is an audience le-s of artisans than
of labourers and costermongers, among whom the demand for
scientific teaching must be created as well as supplied. If once
it can be shown that such addresses are appreciated, we have
good hope of efficient help in carrying them on, but we should
be grateful for offers of help in the pioneer course. Dr. W. B.
Carpenter, Dr. Richardson, and one or two others have given
conditional promises, but we have not yet sufficient names for a
long enough series to try the experiment fairly.
To simplify and popularise science to the utmost, without
lowering it, is not a task which can be performed by those who
hive no qualification except goodwill, and as, unfortunately, the
Victoria Hall is not yet self-supporting, the co 1 mittee cannot
offer anything like adequate remuneration for the services of
competent and therefore busy men. They would gladly be
responsible for the expense of providing lime-light, or hiring
apparatus for experiment-, but beyond this they must appeal to
the public spirit and generosity of scientific men.

Spelling Reform
In your note last week on the United States Spelling Reform
Report, there is a slight misapprehension. It is said that the
result of adopting a phonetic spelling will be the break-up of the
English language. This is quite erroneous. Phonetic spelling
simply represents pronunciation, and if the phonetic spelling of
London English differs from that of Colonial English it can only
be Lecause the pronunciations are different; that is, because the
language has already broken up. On the other hand, if the pro-
nunciations are the same, the spellings will be the same, and I
fail to see how an identical spelling in London and Australia
can bring about a disruption.
In the pie ent state of Biblical criricism, I rather wonder that
the tower of Babel should be appealed to as evidence of Hebreiv
thought; but if the Hebrews were really so impressed with the
c infusion of tongues, and if phonetic spelling is really so condu-
cive to that confusion, then let me a>k: Why did the Massorites,
w ith that story before their eyes, go and make the originally
phonetic Hebrew alphabet more phonetic still by adding the
finest set of vowels that has ever been used? Why, except that

DIFFICULT CASES OF MIMICRY
I SEE a notice regarding mimicry and simulation, by
Mr. A. R. Wallace, in Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 86, and
beg to forward the case of a caterpillar mimicking a shrew,
as a peculiar instance of this curious law.
Here we see the insect unconsciously simulating the
very animal that most likely feels on itself, or at least an
insectivorous mammal. Passing through a dense forest
near a path, I suddenly came on the caterpillar, at about
five feet fro n the ground, on a stout creeper, and of course
mistook it for a shrew. Its remaining, and not running
off, induced me to look closer, when I saw the green
markings, and at once secured the prize, and, after
making a sketch or two, put it in my " hatching" cage;
unfortunately, I could not find what it fed on, and after
spinning a pale greenish cocoon, it died. The natives did
not seem to know it. When moving along, it does so as
other caterpillars, as seen in the outline I, of which 2 is

plan of the head. If suddenly disturbed, it at once strikes
the peculiar pose, as seen in the sketches, and retains it
for some time.
The general colour is a neutral to brown-grey, beauti-
fully marked, and which I have not attempted to imitate;
the general appearance is dark, except where the greenish-
yellow spots occur. It is the first case I know where a
caterpillar mimics a vertebrate animal. The cases are
almost innumerable out here, where insects mimic each
other and similar or different kinds, or leaves, seeds,
flowers, sticks, pieces of grass or clay, &c, &c.; but we

see it also in many other cases, not always protective,
though invaluable to the animal or the insect. The tiger
has one call, when hunting, so like the loud whistle of the
Sambar (deer) that only an expert and old resident can
tell the difference. The deer, if within range, run to it,
and I have myself shot a Samber at twenty yards that
dashed up on my whistling loudly, with a leaf; unfor-
tunately, native shikaries are only too expert at this.
Again, the eye and nose lumps of a crocodile are so like

foam quietly and suddenly sinking below the surface of
the muddy water. In the case of the tiger the simulation
was by sound, to enable it to get food ; in that of the
crocodile the same end is gained by simulation of
appearance, enabling the animal to drift close to prey
without alarming it. S. E. Peal

THE WASHBURN, CHRONOGRAPH
*"pHE article on the Brussels Chronograph (Nature,

scription of the chronograph of this observatory, which
may be taken as representing the form usually adopted
by the best American makers, Alvan Clark and Sons,
Fauth and Co., Stackpole and Brothers, &c. The accom-
panying engraving gives a good general idea of it. The
scale may be obtained by remembering that the iron base
plate is 21J inches by 114 inches. The barrel is 14 inches
long by 7 inches in diameter. The paper used is 23J
inches by 13 inches which provides for a lap at the line of
junction. There is room for the observations of two hours
and forty minutes. The weight employed is fifteen

out affecting its rate. The barrel can be taken out of its
Ys if desired, or one end of the barrel can be lifted by a
small lever, so that it can be turned around to put on or
take off a fresh sheet of paper. In practice several sheets
of paper are put on at a time, so that the last one has
simply to be removed when it is filled, and the pen-
carriage moved back (to the right) to continue the record.
This can be done without stopping the chronograph.
A second of time is 036 inches in length, in the usual
adjustment. The governor is a double conical pendulum,
acted on directly by the weight. It thus tends always to
run too fa,t, as it runs faster and faster, the pendulum
bobs fly out, and finally strike the point of a horizontal
hook shown in the drawing. This hook is attached to a
little cylinder of brass embracing the vertical axis (also
shown), and when the hook is touched by the pendulum
bob (as it is shown in the cut), the hook and the brass
cylinder are carried about the axis through a certain
angle. The work thus done diminishes the speed of the
pendulum, which falls in towards the axis slightly. In
this way the governor and also the barrel rotate alter-

j nately a little faster and a little slower than the desired
mean rate, but these variations are vanishingly small and
of no account whatever in astronomical work. The
pendulums strike the hook on the average from sixty to
ninety times per minute.
The pen-carriage is nothing but an electromagnet
mounted on a frame, which is driven by an endless screw
from right to left in the cut. The carriage may also be
lifted by the hand and moved in either direction. This
is a great convenience in certain kinds of work, such as
comparing a number of clocks together. The record for
each clock can be separated from that of every other
clock by a blank space.

received through the two flexible wires shown in the cut.
These signals can be repeated, by connections to screw-
posts, on the pen-carriage.
The whole machine is light and portable. It taV.es,
say, fifteen minutes to move it from one room to another.
It can be worked equally well with a break or a make-
circuit. Its price is 325-00 dollars. The makers of our
chronograph are Fauth and Co., Washington, D.C., but
the design is that adopted by the Clarks.
The first double conical pendulum of this kind was
made by Dr. Henry Draper, and applied to the driving-
clock of his photographic telescopes. The first governor
on this principle was adopted by Alvan Clark and Sons,
for driving the lieliostats used in the United States
Transit of Venus Expedition of 1874. These governors
had, however, only a single pendulum, and not two
crossed pendulums, as in the cut. I am induced to send
you this brief account of a simple and useful device
which has had a thorough trial of 31 years (it was exhibited

THE LIMIT OF THE LIQUID STATE OF
MA 7 TER
THE conditions under which an investigation is carried
out often predetermine the conclusions to be drawn
from the observations made. That this has been the case
with the observations made upon the upper confines of
the liquid state, there is now ample evidence to show.
When Cagniard de Latour, on heating liquids in sealed
tube«, noticed the disappearance of the liquid surface, he
came to the conclusion that the liquid state had ceased to

volume of his liqu'd to observe whether or not increase
of pressure might again induce liquefaction. This defect
was removed by Dr. Andrews, who constructed the well-
known apparatus for varying the volume by means of a
screw. And it is to the work performed with this appa-
ratus that the above remark is applied. By two modes of
observation Dr. Andrews arrived at the conclusion that
the liquid and gaseous states of matter were continuous.
The experiments being conducted in transparent glass
tubes, the appearance of the contained fluid constituted
one mode, and the registration of the pressure constituted
the other. Neither of these methods could by the necessi-
ties of the case give any aid in determining the state of
matter. Dr. Andrews's method of demonstrating the
continuity, by passing from a lower to a higher tempera-
ture under a pressure which prevented the formation of
vapour, ensured the homogeneity of the fluid under exa-
mination, and precluded the existence of a visible liquid
surface; and as liquid and gas are equally transparent,
no tidings of the state of the fluid under examination
could come to him by observations of its appearance.
How did Dr. Andrews tell when his tubes contained
liquid? By lowering the pressure till a meniscus was
seen. Then the formation of a meniscus is the only test
of the liquid state. Dr. Andrews then obliterated the

only ocular test of the fluid's condition by increasing the
pressure, and raised the temperature till on again reducing
the pressure no meniscus was formed, showing the fluid to
be gaseous, and he then declared that no sudden change
of state had occurredthat is to say, that it was impos-
sible to say that the fluid was either liquid or gaseous,
but that it had probably passed through an intermediate
state. Of course a change of state had taken place, and
if we only reflect that the change from cohesion to re-
pulsion is caused by the thermal velocity of the molecules,
and not by the number of them in a space, the change
should depend upon temperature and not upon pressure.
The characteristic property of the liquid state is then
the possession of cohesion sufficient to form a surface, or
simply surface tension; and could this property be re-
tained in a visible form at all pressures, the existence of
the continuity enunciated by Andrews could be put to a
crucial test. By compressing hydrogen over various
liquids in which it is insoluble, I was enabled to carry the
above proposition into effect, and after several hundreds

Among polypetalous flowers we get some equally inter-

functionless corolla without coining to the conclusion that
Plantago must be descended from an entomophilous an-
cestor. Indeed, P. media still to some extent lays itself
out to attract small flies, by which it is even now often
visited and fertilised.
The Rosacea offer some good examples of green flowers
in which the petals have become quite extinct. Some of
them are entomophilous, and some anemophilous. Alche-
milla vulgaris (lady's mantle) is one of the former class.
It is a degraded representative of the same group as
agrimony; but it has lost its petals altogether. That it

tiny green petalless axillary flowers, self-fertilised, but
occasionally visited by minute insects. Not far from these
may be pl.iced Poterium sangttisorba (Fig. 27), another
degraded type, which has become anemophilous. This
flower, too, is green, and has no petals; it usually pos-
sesses but one carpel, and it is altogether a clearly
debased bisexual form. Its stamens are numerous, and
they hang out to the wind, so do also the feathery stigmas
in the female flowers, to catch the pollen from neighbouring
heads. But the closely-allied Sauguisorba officinalis (Fig.
28) is evidently an entomophilous variation on the same

ancestral form; for it resembles Polerium in every respect
except in its flowers, which have very few stamens, in-
closed in the purple calyx-tube. This interesting case
shows us that when a flower has once lost its petals and
become anemorhilous, it cannot re-develop them if it
reverts to insect fertilisation, but must acquire a coloured
calyx instead. The same lesson is perhaps elsewhere
enforced by Glaux maritima among the Primulacece, and
by Chmatis among the Ranunculacca.
Mr. Darwin remarks that anemophilous flowers never
possess a gaily-coloured corolla. The reason is clear.
Such an adjunct could only result in the attraction of

stray insects, which would uselessly cat up the pollen,
and so do harm to the plant. Hence, when flowers rever
to wind-fertilisation, both disuse and natural selection
cause them to lose their petals, and become simply
green.
In practice, however, it is often hard to distinguish
between the casually entomophilous, the self-fertilised, and
the really anemophilous species; and they are so inter-
mixed that it may perhaps be best to consider them
together. For example, the common ash (Fraxinus
excelsior) belongs to a gamopetalous family, the Olcacecr,

and from them we can trace a gradual decline, through
plants like dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), which
has a green calyx, but no corolla (Figs. 31 and 32), to
very degenerate green blossoms like our own spurges
{Euphorbia), which consist of several extremely simplified
flowers, collected together in a common involucre. Each
separate male floret is here reduced to a single stamen,
raised on a short peduncle, and with a distinct joint at
the spot where the petals once stood (Fig. 33). It is worthy of notice, too, that when these degenerate, but still entomophilous, green flowers have found it desirable to attract insects by developing new coloured surfaces in place of the lost corolla, they have not done so by
producing a fresh set of petals, but have acquired coloured
bracts or involucres instead, as in the well-known latro-
p/ias and Poinseitias of our hot-houses. This instance
is exactly analogous to that of the Sanguisorba. It tends
to show that petals are not developed from bracts, but
from altered stamens.
From cases like these we go down insensibly through
all the ranks of the dicotyledonous Monochlamyda. In
the Paronychiacea, for example, we get an order closely
allied to the Caryophyllacece (especially to Polycarpon);
and in one genus (Corrigiola) the flowers have small
white petals, which certainly aid in attracting insects.

But in Herniaria the flowers are quite green, and the
petals are reduced to five small filaments, thus partially
reverting to their presumed original character as sta-
mens. In Scleranthus the filaments are often wanting,
and in some exotic species altogether so. The Amaran-
lacea, unrepresented in Britain, approach the last-named
family very nearly, but have the petals altogether obso-
lete; and in many cases, such as Prince's feather
(Amaranthus hypoclwndriacus) and Love-lies-bleeding
(A. candatus), the calyx becomes scarious and brightly
coloured. The Chenopodiacece are other near relations,
in which also the petals are quite obsolete; and in most
of them the perianth (or calyx) is green. In Sali-
cornia it has become so embedded in the succulent leaf-
less stem as to be almost indistinguishable. The Poly-
gonacea , on the other hand, are a group of plants, allied
to Chenopodiacece, but with a row of degraded petals, and
a strong tendency to produce coloured perianths, analo-
gous to that which we observed in Sanguisorba. The
flowers of Ruvux, the docks, are sometimes green, some-
times red; those of Polygonum are pale-green, white, or
pink. Rumex is sometimes, Polygonum constantly, fer-
tilised by insects.
There remain doubtful, then, among green Dicoty-
ledons, only the highly anemophilous families, like the

nettles (Urticacea), and the catkin-bearing trees (Amen-
tifera;). The former have a well-developed calyx, at least to
the male flowers (Fig. 34), and it is difficult to see how any
one who compares them with Scleranthus or Mercurialis,
known descendants of petaliferous forms, can doubt that
they too are degenerate types. Indeed, the mere fact
that the stamens are opposite to the lobes of the calyx,
instead of alternate with them, in itself shows that a petal-
whorl has been suppressed; as is likewise the case in the
goose-foots and many other doubtful instances.
As to the Amcntifera:, Cupuliferce, and other catkin-
bearers, at first sight we might suppose them to be primi-
tive green anemophilous orders. But on closer considera-
tion, we may see grounds for believing that they are really
degenerate descendants of entomophilous plants. In the
alder (A/nus) the male catkins consist of clustered
flowers, three together under a bract, each contain-
ing a four-lobed perianth, with four stamens within.
These little florets exactly resemble, on a smaller scale,
those of the nettle; and the stamens here, again, are
opposite to the calyx-lobes, which of course implies the

wherever green flowers possess any perianth, or the relic

nection of the engineer with the progress of civilisation

and the comforts of daily life. Perhaps no better example
of this could be found than in the town of Leeds. It is
not necessary,« nd certainly it would not be very easy, to
detail all the varied productions of Leeds, in which the
engineer now plays an indispensable part. Cne or two
interesting instances may, however, be cited from one of
two papers read, to show to what extent manual labour is
being replaced by the application of machinery.
As late as 1857 nearly all the clothing in Leeds was
hand-made. At the present time a machine like a band-
saw, but with a knife-edge, is employed to cut out the
clothes. Some twenty-five pieces of double-cloth laid on
each other are thus cut out at once. The parts are then
sewn at the rate of from 700 to 2000 stitches a minute,
and finally are ironed by a machine. Indeed, the several
processes of cutting out, sewing together, binding, braiding,
putting in sleeves, sewing on buttons, making button-
holes, and ironing, are all done by machinery. The result
is that between three and four million garments are
annually made in Leeds alone. In the hat and cap in-
dustry, machinery is very largely used, the production
being as much as 70,000 dozen per week. The manufac-
ture of boots and shoes is carried on almost entirely by
machinery, and though each boot passes through the
hands of from six to twelve persons, such an article can
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be completely made in half an hour, from one to two
million pairs of boots are being thus annually produced.
The saving of manual labour, as seen by the above facts,
presents a striking contrast to its waste as shown in the
gigantic structures of the East; but, as the President in
his address remarked, there is a reverse to the medal.
The smoke nuisance yet overshadows much good work (in
few places more than in Leeds), when it is admitted that
it is altogether inexcusable, and cannot be too severely
dealt with. Science and art have practically overcome
it; and experience enables many to assert that money can
be profitably laid out and yield good interest in the abate-
ment of this unpardonable nuisance. It is to be hoped that
one result of these meetings will be to do all that is
possible that posterity may not "assuredly lay its finger
upon the great blot of waste, and stigmatise our age as
the Black Age, which has spoilt by careless, unnecessary,
and selfish emissions of smoke and noxious gases, many
a noble town and many a lovely spot on earth."

Many preparations were necessary for a lengthened
stay in so solitary and primitive a place as Belligemma.
In the first place, permission had to be obtained from the
Governor, Sir James Longden, for the Professor's residence
in the Rest-House, since a stay of a few days is all that
is usually allowed in these official substitutes for hotels.
The permission was of course, readily granted, and the
Professor digresses to give a few words of strong
commendation to the order and regularity which every-
where follows British rule, and to the practical good sense
with which the Home government varies its mode of
dealing with its colonies according to their requirements
and idiosyncracies. Ceylon, for instance, is independent
of the Indian government, and immediately under the
control of the Colonial Minister in London; the Governor
is virtually supreme, and seldom has recourse to the
deci-ions of his purely deliberative parliament. It is
customary to ascribe to this despotism, so averse to the
English nature in general, most of the grievances which
affect the prosperity of the island ; but better reflection
seems to show that a colony containing two and a half
million inhabitants, among whom not more than 3,000 are
Europeans, requires the concentration of power in a single
hand, and that a truer ground for complaint is the
Governor's short tenure of office, four years barely

sufficing to make him acquainted with the needs of the
island and its inhabitants.
Prof. Haeckel's next care was to provide himself
with letters of introduction for his stay in Galle, en route
for Belligemma, and having made all necessary purchases,
to see his sixteen chests securely packed on a great two-
wheeled bullock cart which was to occupy a week on the
road between Colombo and Galle. Bullock carts form
the only means of transit for heavy goods in those parts
of Ceylon which are provided with roads. The large
ones carry as much as forty hundredweight, and are
drawn by four humped oxen or zebus. The waggon is a
babarous two-wheeled contrivance, with a covering of
plaited cocoa-nut leaves, and the weight has to be carefully
disposed so as to throw the centre of gravity exactly over
the axis of the wheels. Hundreds of such carts, some
with two, others with four oxen are thus employed along
the roads connecting the towns of Ceylon.
On December 9th, Prof. Haeckel left the hospitable
Whist Bungalow, accompanied by the hearty good wishes
and judicious counsels of his host and other friends.

of houses and country bazaar or market place. The road
turns frequently towards the sea, and sometimes actually
skirts the rocky coast. Here tracts of soft level sand
alternate with rocky hillocks picturesquely clothed with
the curious pandanus or screw pine. The cylindrical
stem of this tree, seldom more than from twenty to
forty feet in height, is bent and twisted, and its
branches are forked or extended at right angles like a
chandelier. Every branch bears at its extremity a thick
bunch of large sword-shaped leaves (like the Daacaena?
and the Yucca). Some of the leaves are sea-green, others
of a darker shade, all gracefully curved and with a spiral
twist at their base, which gives the branch very much the
appearance of a screw. At the base of the whole bunch
of leaves hang white clusters of blossom with a marvellous
perfume, or large red fruit very like the Anana. But the

tree is chiefly remarkable for its numerous delicate air-
roots, which are given off from the stem and ramify down-
wards in many directions ; when they reach the groundthey
take root and serve to support the weak stem. It looks
as if the tree were walking on stilts, as it rises above the
lower brushwood, pushing its way between the cleft rocks
of the shore, or creeping along the ground at their base.
The white sand composing the level tracts of the shore is
diversified wiih dark, rocky headlands and animated by
brisk little sand crabs so nimble in flight as to have earned
the classic name of Ocypode. Numerous hermit ciabs too,
(Pagurus) wander with a more leisurely pace among their
swift-footed cousins, and bear with much dignity the snail
shells which protect their soft and sensitive hind-quarters.
Here and there sand-pipers, herons, plovers, and other
shore birds, are busily employed in catching fish, in
formidable competition with the Singhalese fishermen.
The latter pursue their calling, some singly, others in
companies, in which case they go out in several canoes

Prof. Maggi has recently made a protistological analysis of

between Angera and Arona. There is a proposal, it is known,
to supply Milan with potable water from this source. No
injurious bacteria or flagtllata were detected. The small deposit,
probably from the bottom of the lake, is pronounced innocuous;
it consists partly of harmless inorganic matter in reduction, and
incapable of further evolution. The few diatom scales in it are
harmless, being pure silica. The very small number of live
organisms, as an Amabi radiosn, Auerb., some Diatoms, and
Chlorococcum vulgare, Grev., indicate that the water is pure;
for otherwise the r life would be impossible. The Diatoms and
Cblorococcuin, feeding on inorganic matter, cannot serve as
criteria of the presence of putrescible substances. These
organisms were always found alive, even several months after
extraction, so that their presence in small quantity could not be
very hurtful; still it would be well to purify the water contain-
ing them. In fine, Prof. Maggi pronounces the water in ques-

In an article on Foreign Chinese Literature the North China
Herald, in a recent issue, refers to the translation of modern
scientific works into Chinese. In May, 1877, a Committee of
the general body of missionaries in China was appointed to
superintend the publication of a series of scientific and educa-
tional works in the Chinese language for use among the Chinese.
1 his project has been carried out ever since, and a large number
of text-books are now undergoing translation at the hands of
Sinologues. The majority of the workers are missionaries, but
their ranks have been largely recruited from other sources. The
subjects undertaken are of a most comprehensive nature. They
include treatises on logic, mental and moral philosophy, political
economy, philology, jurisprudence, the philology and sttucture
of plants, anatomy, mathematical physics, church history, meteor-
ology, astronomy, chemistry, trigonometry, algebra, natural
philosophy, zoology, ethnology, mineralogy, physical and poli-
tical geography, history, besides other works. The undertaking
of this large and important series of works reflects the highest
credit on the industry and intelligence of the missionary body.
But the work of putting the Chinese in possession of the
results of Western knowledge has not been confined to the mis-
sionaries. The Inspector-General of Chinese Customs, Sir

A MEETING of Japanese literati, versed in European, Chinese,
and Japanese languages, was recently held in Tokio. Among
those present were the officers of the education and other de-
partments, who regret the confusion and intricacies of the Japa-
nese spoken and written languages. The object of the meeting
was to consider the best steps to be taken for purifying the
Japanese language from all foreign elements. After a lengthy
discussion it was decided to publish grammars and other books
in Kana, or the syllabary system, without the employment of
Chinese characters. A periodical is also to be devoted to the
furtherance of this scheme. The project seems a visionary one.
The Chinese element in the Japanese language is a very ancient
and powerful one. All Japanese philosophy, much of its
religion, its arts and sciences, have come from China, and have
brought their terminology with them. Even at the present day,
when the Japanese want a name for western inventions, for

September, 1879, issued an ordinance, fixing as an upper limit
for potassium sulphate in wines so doctored, 2 grammes per
litre. Various complaints then arose from merchants, who
thought the regulation too stringent; and the Direction of In-
ternal Affairs nomina'ed a Commission, conisting of Herren
Lichtheim, Luch inger, and Nencki to study the subject afresh.
In their report (Journal fur Prakt. Chan.) they come to the conclu-
sion- (1) that the perniciousness of plastered wines even when they
contain more >hin 2 gr. sulphate of potassium per litre, is far
from being demonstrated indisputably. On the other hand it
remains proved that wines strongly plastered have sometimes
cau-ed slight accidents, and it results from our theoretic study
that the prolonged u^e of such a drink cannot be without pre-
judice to health; (2) that we therefore do not think it well to
leave the trade in plastered wines without any contiol. While
recognising the difficulty of fixing an absolute limit for plastering,
they approve as sufficient that of the ordinance in question ; on
the one hand, it guarantees the public against illne-s from use of
wines too much plastered, and on the other it is not a heavier
fetter for the producer than similar prescriptions in France,

where the interest in tolerance of plastered wines is vastly greater.
Each buyer who has ordered a natural wine should have the
right to refuse any wine containing more than o-6gr. neutral
sulphate of potassium per litre. The reporters are unable to
answer a question as to the action of plastered white wines on
the system as compared with red.

For the determination of sun temperature, he used a thermome-
ter technically known as the blackened bulb in vacuo laid in full
sunshine upon a sheet of white paper. The shade or air tem-
perature was measured by an ordinary thermometer with a clear
glass bulb and a scale engraved upon the stem. This thermome-
ter was placed upon the same sheet of paper, and was shaded by
a small white paper arch which admitted of a free circulation of
air around the bulb.
He then explained the terms "sun temperature," "shade tem-
perature," and "s <lar intensity." By shade tern) erature is
meant the temperature of free air in full sunshine. Strictly it
ought to be ascertained v iihout any shade at all; for as soon as
a shade is produced, conditions are introduced which often
entirely baffle the object of the observer. The shade of a para-
sol has a different temperature from the shade of a tree, and this,
again, differs widely from that of a house. The temperature of
the shade of a sheet of tinfoil is quite different from that of a
sheet of writing paper. Indeed it may be truly said that every shade has its own peculiar temperature. The following table
shows the effect of the area of shade, and of the quality of the
shading material :

The sun's altitude was unfav. urable for the comparison;
nevertheless, there were here observed differences of 8'6°C.
and 10 "6°.
The farther we recede from the earth, the nearer we realise
the conditions cf solar radiation altogether outside the limits of
the atmosphere, where the solar intensity (assuming the sun's
emission to remain constant) is uniform from sunrise to sunset.
Throughout the dreary winter- days, when, even in the country,
a leaden sky oppresses u=, it is tantalising to reflect that, at the
moderate height of 5,000 feet, which can be reached by a
balloon in a few minutes, there is probably blue sky and brilliant
sunshine.
Latitude profoundly, ihough irregularly, affects air tempera-
ture, for in high latitudes less solar heat falls upon each square
foot of the earth's surface, and therefore the air resting upon
that surface is warmed to less extent. But obliquity of the sun's
rays has no such influence on solar intensity, for the highest
readings of solar heat at or near sea-level have been observed
near to the Arctic circle, as is seen from the following table :

at the sea-level, a position favourable for air-, but not for sun-
warmlh. In our large town?, however, we artificially create an
impenetrable barrier to solar radiation by throwing into the air
the imperfectly burnt product-; of bituminous coal.
The>e products are of three kindssoot, tar, and steam.
Every ton of bituminous coal burnt in our grates gives off about
6 cwts. of volatile but condensable product?. The less perfect
the combustion the more tar and the less steam will be produced.
If perfectly burnt without any smoke, then about 9 cwts. of
steam, occupying 27,359 cubic feet at 100" C, or 20,024 cubic
feet at o" C. will be sent into the air. Now, 33,333 tons of
bituminous coal are, on the average daily consumed in London
in winter, giving 667,460,000 cubic feet of steam at 0° C.
This combustion of enormous quantities of bituminous coal acts
in the production of town f g in three ways :1st. By supplying
the basis of all fogcondensed watery particles. 2nd. By deter-
mining the condensation of atmospheric moi-ture in the form of
fog. 3rd. By coating the fog particles with tar, and thus making
them more persistent.
All fogs have for their basis watery particles, and the greater
part even of the suspended matters visible in a ray of electric

light consists of these particles, for the air becomes nearly clear
when it is heated somewhat above 100° C. [Experiment shown].
Everything therefore which increases the proportion of aqueous
vapour in town air tends to produce fog. But aqueous vapour
alone would 1 robably never produce fog, for it condenses at once
to large particles, which rapidly fall as rain. When, however,
solid or liquid particles are present in the air, the minute spherules
of fog are produced. This was fir.-t shown by Messrs. Coulier
and Mascart, in 1875, and their results have since been confirmed
by Mr. Aitkin. The speaker showed that air filtered through
cotton wool, though afterwards saturated with moisture, produced
no fog when its temperature was lowered ; but as soon as a small
quantity of the dusty air of the theatre was admitted fog was
immediately formed, whilst, when a little coal smoke was intro-
duced, a dense and more persistent fog was the result.
The fog once formed is rendered more persistent by the coating
of tarry matter which it receives fro 11 the products of the imper-
fect combustion of smoky coal. The speaker had made numerous
experiments on the retardation of evaporation by films of coal tar.
He had found that the evaporation of water in a platinum dish
placed in a strong draught of air was retarded in one experiment
by 84 per cent, and in another by 78'6 per cent., when a thin
film of coal tar was placed on the surfaces. Even by the mere
blowing of coal smoke on the surface of tbe water for a few
seconds, the evap< ration was retarded by from 77*3 to 81'5 per

cent. Dro| s of water suspended in loops of platinum wire were
also found to have their evaporation retarded by coal smoke.

IT is now thirty-three years ago since Oscar Schmidt,
then a young Privat Docent, published the first
edition of his " Handbook of Comparative Anatomy" as
a guide to his course of lectures. Successive generations
of students have called for successive editions, until in
the present year the author is in the enviable position of
issuing the eighth edition of his Handbook, and he has
added to its value by now for the first time illustrating it
with upwards of 100 well executed woodcuts. It would
be out of place, and indeed quite unnecessary, to enter
into a detailed criticism of a work, so well known as the
present, and which has obviously supplied a want felt by
so many students. As regards the general motive of the

book we may say that it presents an outline of the com-
parative anatomy both of the Invertebrata and Vertebrata,
written in a clear style and methodically arranged.
He classifies animals into eight groups: Protista and
Protozoa, Ccelenterata, Echinodermata, Vermes, Arthro-
poda, Mollusca, Tunicata, Vertebrata. This classifica-
tion will scarcely commend itself to the more ardent
members of that school of zoologists, which bases taxo-
nomy on embryology; and which considers no system of
classification is of value unless it expresses the path that
has been taken by animals in the course of their evolu-
tion. By these zoologists Prof. Schmidt's system will
without doubt be regarded as old-fashioned. But it has
the merit of simplicity, and this from the student's point
of view is no slight recommendation. Moreover, taxo-
nomie systems, more especially of the Invertebrata,
based on supposed phylogenic relations, are as yet mere
speculations. They have their value, no doubt, as group-
ing together certain ascertained facts, and as suggesting
new directions for investigation. But they are in the
main quite hypothetical, and without such fixity of know-
ledge as will give them permanent value.
There is one point in the classification of the Mammalia
followed by Prof. Schmidt, to which we must take very
decided exception. We refer to the adoption of the
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
placenta as a dominant character in the subdivision of
the Monodelphia. Milne-Edwards, Huxley, Haeckel,
and Carus have all undoubtedly attached much import-
ance to this organ in taxonomy, but from the fuller know-
ledge that we now possess, both of its form in various
mammals and of the mode in which it is shed during
parturition, it is clear that its characters are not of such
primary value as to outweigh, in framing a system of
classification, those furnished by the other organic sys-
tems. In placing the Prosimii (Halbaffen) amongst the
DeJduata, Schmidt has committed a similar error to that
into which Haeckel has also fallen. For the Lemurs,
whose placentation has been carefully studied both by
V>l. xxvi.No. 669
Alphonse Milne-Edwards in Paris and by W. Turner in
Edinburgh, are unquestionably as adeciduate as a mare,
a pig, or a whale. In the lemurs, as in thes; animals,
the villi are diffused over the greater part of the sur-
face of the chorion, and the sac of the allantois is
relatively large. The evidence, therefore, is altogether
opposed to retaining them in the position in which

and pupil teachers in some one branch of knowledgelet it be
botany, geology, or entomology. Let them show the teachers
how to collect and press, say a dozen plants, help them to classify
and ntme them, both in English and I atin, and let them teach
say to the First Standard, what they know on the subject,
naklng th- <-hildren bring each plant after it has been shown. Even in town schools there will be some country friend who
could send up two or three specimens every week in the spring and summer.
I would suggest that the discarded child school books will
make herbaria, and convenient books for catalogue; of speci-
mens.
For a geological museum a small cupboard with, say in this
neighbourhood, seven shelves, would hold two specimens from
each of our prominent strata, Lower, Middle, and Upper Lias,
th« Midford, or as Mr. Witchell, of Stroud, wants to call them,
the Cotteswold Sands the Inferior Oolite, Fuller's Earth, and
Great Oolite, all of which can be seen from this parish if the
two higher beds are not actually in it. On theim-ide of the cup-
board doors might be put, boldly co'oured, sections of the strata.
Geologists might greatly help in seeing that the names of the
strata and specimens were correctly given and pronounced, an 1
a catalogue written out. And if prizes were given to promote
even the most elementary knowledge in teachers and scholars,
much would be done to make "science subjects" interesting and
useful.
I would sugget that natural history societies and field clubs

Two Kinds of Stamens with Different Functions in the

In Nature, vol. xxiv. p. 307 is a very interesting letter on
this subject, in which « hile the functions performed by the two
kinds of stamens are very clearly indicated, the modus operandi
of fertilisation, it appears to me, is less clearly expressed. I
have witnessed in many instances the visitation by various species
of large Hymenoptera, such as Xylocopa and Bombus, of species
especially of the genus Mctastoma, possessing stamens in all
points corresponding to that occurring in the Heeria described
in the letter referred to and what takes place seems to be as
follows. The large bees evidently make for the yellow platform
offered by the short stamens, perhaps because they do not per-
ceive the pistil and long stamens owing to their projection against
the broad petaled corolla of the same colour in the background,
and invariably receive the pistil between their legs, their feet
settling on the fork of the co nective, the instant effect of which

NATURE
THE "EIRA" EXPEDITION
A FTER the horrors of the Jeannette expedition, every
**¦ one will be relieved to learn that on Sunday Mr.
Leigh Smith and all his men were safely landed at
Aberdeen in the Hope, under the care of Sir Allen Young.
Sir Allen has not been long in attaining the object for
which he set out, although the safety of the Eira expedi-
tion would have been secured, even had no help been
sent from England, for when they reached Matotschkin
Schar, they found both the Willem Barents and a
Russian vessel. The scientific results of the expedition,
we regret to say, are almost nil.
On June 14, 1881, the Eira left Peterhead. The ice
reached very far south, and no opening could be found
to enable her to get north until the middle of July. Franz
Josef's Land was reached on July 23, and the Eira steamed
along the coast to within fifteen miles of Cape Ludlow.
The ice was closely packed to the north, so it was de-
cided to return to Gray Bay and wait till a more favour-
able opportunity should present itself to proceed. On
August 7 the Eira was made fast to the land-floe near
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
Bell Island, and a storehouse was erected of materials
taken out in the ship. On August 15 she left Bell
Island, and, being unable to pass to the eastward of
Barents Hook, she was made fast to the land-floe off
Cape Flora. The next few days were spent in collecting
plants and fossils, which unfortunately were lost with the
vessel. On August 21 the Eira was heavily nipped by
the ice, and about 10 a.m. a leak was discovered, and
barely two hours elapsed till the vessel had to be
abandoned. All the boats were saved, and most of the
men saved some clothes and bedding.
The tent was ultimately erected on Cape Flora, and here
the expedition spent the winter, making the best of their
circumstances. But little food had been saved, and the
party had therefore to keep a sharp look out for wal-
ruses, bears, and other native game, on which they lived,
and on which, along with a daily drop of rum, they main-
tained their health, according to the report of the surgeon.
There were one or two cases of illness, but no trace of
scurvy, though 70° of frost were at times experienced. In
June the ice was cleared away, and on the 21st four boats
were started from Cape Flora, with twenty-five men and
provisions for six months. The Eira men were more
fortunate than the discoverers of Franz Josef Land in
their escape; for although they had sometimes to drag

their boats over the ice, they reached NovayaZemlya, at
Matotschkin Schar, on August 2. Next day they were
sighted by the William Barents, and as Sir Allen Young,
in the Hope, was only a mile away, Mr. Leigh Smith and
his men were soon welcomed on board the steamer sent
to rescue them.
When Mr. Smith publishes his detailed narrative, we
may find that he has been able to make some addition to
a knowledge of the geography and natural history of the
region where he has wintered, though we fear it cannot
be much. All his collections went down with the Eira,
so that science cannot be a great gainer by his expedition.
Until details are to hand, it is impossible to say whether
the catastrophe to the vessel could have been avoided, or
whether it was one of those accidents for which all Arctic
explorers must be prepared. The ice seems to have been
in motion very early this year for that region, and we know
that it has come down unusually far south ; any informa-
tion concerning the movements of the ice in high lati-
tudes during the past spring and summer would be
welcome.

stomach. Once a bear had eaten a large piece of greasy
canvas which had been thrown away and had been blown
some 200 or 300 yards from the house. He then came
up to the house and commenced to eat our blubber, but
was immediately shot. On February 20 a bear was seen
about 350 feet above the hill at the back of the house.
Some hands went up with a rifle and found that the bear
had a hole there, out of which they could not get it
fortunately for them, as they had only one rifle
with them, and that would not go off, the lock having
been frozen. We never saw any young bear with it. The
last time the bear was seen at its hole was on March 1.
No track of a bear could be traced up the hill, but the
foot-marks of an old bear and a cub were seen on the low
land, about 300 yards to the eastward of the house. No
old she-bears with young cubs were seen before we left
the land in June. In July, 1881, on nearing Cape
Crowther, walrus were seen lying on loose pieces of ice in
great numbers. Sometimes twenty or more were counted
huddled up in a heap on a small piece of ice. By going

after the first shot was fired they tumbled into the water,
and would go swimming about and barking round the
boat, but never attacked us. In September they were
very numerous on the loose ice round Bell Island, and
also in the water off Cape Flora. On October 28 five
were shot lying on the ice edge. When the daylight re-
turned in February, walrus were constantly seen swimming
about in the water. A land floe began to form in March,
and no water remained within seven or eight miles of the
land, but frequently on looking with the glass from the
hill, walrus could be seen in the water, and on June 13
the land ice broke away, and on June 15 the five walrus
were shot. A boat that went over to Bell Island reported
that walrus were lying in scores on the loose ice round
about Bell Island. Mr. Leigh Smith thinks that the
walrus leave the country during the winter, but seem to
remain in the water, especially if it is shallow. They
never saw any signs of their taking the land and lying up
for the winter. White whales and narwhal were seen in
great numbers in September and October travelling to
the south-east, and in June one or two large shoals were
seen travelling west and west-north-west."

p>ROF. HAECKEL. in describing his first impression of
* Galle, does not fail to mention as one of its principal
features the long lines of shady Suriya trees and flowering Hibiscus, planted by the Dutch, and giving the streets
the appearance of a garden. He says nothing, however,
of a plague produced by the Suriya, and noted by other
travellers, namely, the hairy green caterpillar, which
frequents it in great numbers. At a certain stage of its
growth it drops to the ground, and there hides in order to
pass through its metamorphosis. When, as often happens,
it alights on some passer-by, it inflicts a sting more
severe and far more lasting than that of a nettle or star-
fish.
The professor found himself, as might have been

representation of the coral insect "in his habit as he
lives." For my own part, it is nine years since, in the
spring of 1873 I visited the coral banks of Tur at the foot
of Sinai, and there first became acquainted with the
wonderful manifestations of life in this submarine fairy
land. My interest was roused to the highest pitch, and I
endeavoured, in my popular treatise on "Arabian Corals"
(Berlin, 1876), briefly to describe the organisation of these
curious animals and their mode of life in common with
that of various other creatures. The corals of Ceylon as
I studied them at Galle, and afterwards in more detail at
Belligemma, recalled pleasant memories and enriched
my mind with a store of fresh observations."
"The marine fauna of Ceylon is indeed closely related to
that of the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, the two having
many genera and species in common. But in number
and variety of forms of life, the extensive bay of the
Indian Ocean with its varied coast formation is far richer
than the confined Arabian Gulf where the conditions of
life are simpler and more uniform, and I found consider-

able variations underlying the apparently similar physiog-
nomy of the coral banks in the two districts. Those of
Tur were chiefly characterised by warm tones, such as
yellow, orange, or red, while the coral groves of Ceylon
displayed little but green in every variety of shade.
Yellow green Alcyonaria alternated with sea-green
Heteropora, malachite green Anthophylla with olive-
green Millepora, emerald green Madrapora and Astraea
with brown-green Montipora and Maiandrina. Ran-
sonnet has justly remarked on the predominance of green
throughout the island of Ceylon. Not only is this 'ever-
green isle' decked the whole year through with verdure
that never fades, but even the animals that inhabit it are
for the most part green in colour. The most frequently
occurring birds and lizards, butterflies and beetles, are of
a brilliant green hue: so also are many of the fishes and
crabs, Amphinomae and Actinia; even animals which
elsewhere are seldom or never green, here don the prevail-
ing livery ; such are star-fish (Ophiurida), sea-urchins, sea-
cucumbers, giant-mussels (Tridacna), and many others.
The explanation of this remarkable phenomenon must he
sought for in the Darwinian theory of development,
especially in the law of adaptation as applied to the
'sympathetic selection of colour,' which I have demon-
strated in my 'Natural History of Creation' (seventh
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
edition, p. 235). The less the colour of an animal differs
from that of its surroundings, the less likely it is to attract
the attention of its enemies; it is better able also to
approach its prey unobserved, and its chances in the
struggle for existence are thereby indefinitely increased."
"Natural selection will strengthen the resemblance in
colour between animals and their surroundings, as being
of advantage to the former. The coral banks of Ceylon,
with their inhabitants, afford as good an illustration of
this theory as the animals dwelling in the woods and
thickets of the island, and in purity and brilliancy of
colour the former have a distinct advantage. It would
be a great mistake to imagine that an effect of monotony
resulted from this tendency to uniformity of colour. On
the contrary, the eye is never tired of admiring the mani-
fold combinations and modifications which occur, and
which are heightened by the not infrequent juxtaposition
of other colours. Just as the brilliant hues, red, yellow,
or blue of many of the birds and insects of Ceylon
heighten the effect of the dark green foliage, so the coral
banks gain in beauty from contrast with the many-

the foot, where they break off and remain, inflicting pain-
ful and dangerous wounds. But the worst of all injuries
to the skin are inflicted by the coral rocks themselves.
The myriads of hard points and edges with which they
are armed inflict numberless wounds on the hands which
attempt to uproot them."
"I never in my life had such a lacerated and smarting
skin as after a few days diving and coral fishing at the
Point de Galle. The wounds did not heal for several
weeks. But what were such temporary sufferings as these
in comparison with the wealth of new impressions and

In venturing to addre-s the British Association from this
chair, I feel that I have taken upon myself a task involving very
serious responsibility. The Association has for half a century
fulfilled the important mission of drawing together, once every
year, scientists from all parts of the country for the purpose of
discussing questions of mutual interest, and of cultivating those
personal relations which aid so powerfully in harmonising views,
and in stimulating concerted action for the advancement of
science.
A sad event casts a shad jw over our gathering. While still
mourning the irreparable loss Science had sustained in the
person of Charles Darwin, whose bold conceptions, patient
labour, and genial mind made him almost a type of unsurpassed
excellence, telegraphic news reached Cambridge just a month
ago, to the effect that our Honorary Secretary, Professor F. M.
Balfour, had lost his life during an attempted ascent of the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Aiguille Blanche de Penteret. Although only thirty years of
age, few men have won distinction so rapidly and so deservedly.
After attending the lectures of Micnael Foster, he completed his
studies of Biology under Dr, Anton Dohrn at the Zoological
Station of Naples in 1875. In 1878 he was elected a Fellow, and
in November last a member of the Council of th ¦ Royal Society,
when he was also awarded one of the Royal Medals for his em-
bryological researches. Within a short interval of time Glasgow
University conferred on him their honorary degree of I.L.D., he
was elected President of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,
and after having declined very tempting offers frooo. the Univer-
sities of Oxford and Edinburgh he accepted a professorship of
Animal Morphology created for him by his own University. Few
men could have borne without hurt such a stream of honourable
distinctions, but in young Balfour genius and independence of
thought were happily blended with industry and personal
modesty; these won for him the friendship, esteem, and ad-
miration of all who knew him.
Since the days of the hr>t meetinj of the Association in York
in 1831, great changes have taken place in the means at our dis-
posal for exchanging views, either personally or through the

construction, and that Telford, the founder of the Institution of
Civil Engineers, must have had in his mind's eye, when he defined civil engineering as "the art of directing the great sources of
power in na'ure."
These considerations may serve to show that although we see
the men of both abstract and applied science group themselves in
minor bodies for the better prosecution of special object", the
points of contact between the different branches of knowledge
are ever multiplying, all tending to form part of a mighty tree
the tree of modern scienceunder whose ample shadow its
cultivators will find it both profitable and pleasant to meet, at
least one: a year; and considering that this tree is not the
growth of one country only, but spreads both its roots and
branches far and wide, it appears desirable that at these yearly
gatherings other nations should be more fully represented than
has hitherto been the case. The subjects discussed at our meet-
ings are without exception of general interest, but many of them
bear an international character, such as the systematic collection
of magnetic, astronomical, meteorological, and geodetical obser-
vations, the formation of a universal code for signalling at sea,
and for distinguishing lighthouses, and especially the settlement
of scientific nomenclatures and units of measurement, regarding

all of which an international accord is a matter of the utmost
practical importance.
As regards the measures of length and weight it is to be re-
gretted that this country still stands aloof from the movement
initiated in France towards the close of last century; but, con-
sidering that in scientific work metrical measure is now almost
universally adopted, and that its use has been already legalised in
this country, I venture to hope that its universal adoption for
commercial purposes will soon follow as a matter of course. The
practical advantages of such a measure to the trade of this
country would, 1 am convinced, be very great, for English
goods, such as machinery or metal rolled to current sections, are
now almost excluded from the continental market, owing to the
unit measure employed in their production- The principal im-
pediment to the adopiion of the metre consists in the strange
anomaly that although it is legal to use that measure in com-
merce, and although a copy of the standard metre is kept in the
Standards' Department of the Board of Trade, it is impossible
to procure legalised rods representing it, and to use a non-
legalised copy of a standard in commerce is deemed fraudulent.
Would it not be desirable that the British Association should
endeavour to bring about the use in this country of the metre
and kilogramme, and, as a preliminary step, petition the Govern-
ment to be represented on the International Metrical Commis-
sion, whose admirable establishment at Sevres possesses, inde-

pendently of its practical work, considerable scientific interest, as a well-found laboratory for developing methods of precise
measurement.
Next in importance to accurate measures of length, weight,
and time, stand, for the purposes of modern science, those of
electricity.
The remarkably clear lines separating conductors from non-
conductors of electricity, and magnetic from non-magnetic sub-
stances, enable us to measure electrical quantities and effects with
almost mathematical precision; and, although the ultimate
nature of this, the youngest scientifically investigated form of
energy, is yet wrapt in mystery, its laws are the most clearly
established, and its measuring instruments (galvanometers,
electrc meters, and magnetometers), are amongst the most
accurate in physical science. Nor could any branch of science
or industry be named in which electrical phenomena do not
occur, to exercise their direct and important influence.
If, then, electricity stands foremost amongst the exact sciences,
it follows that its unit measures should be determined with the
utmost accuracy. Yet, twenty years ago very little advance had
been made towards the adoption of a rational system. Ohm

has done so much to develop the dynamical theory of heat.
Professor Clausius urges the advantages of the statical system
of measurement for simplicity, and shows that the numerical
values of the two systems can readily be compared by the intro-
duction of a factor, which he proposes to call the critical velocity;
this, Weber has already shown to be nearly the same as the
velocity of light. It is not immediately evident how by the in-
troduction of a simple multiple, signifying a velocity, the statical can be changed into dynamical values, and I am indebted to my
friend Sir William Thomson for an illustration which struck me
as remarkably happy and convincing. Imagine a ball of con-
ducting matter so constituted that it can at pleasure be caused to
shrink. Now let it first be electrified and left insulated with
any quantity of electricity on it. After that, let it be connected
with the earth by an excessively fine wire or a not perfectly dry
silk fibre; and let it shrink just so rapidly as to keep its poten-
tial constant, till the whole charge is carried off. The velocity
with which its surface approaches its centre is the electrostatic
measure of the conducting power of the fibre. Thus we see
how "conducting power" is, in electrostatic theory, properly
measured in term - of a velocity. Weber had shown h r.v, in

electro-nagnetic theory, the resistance, or the reciprocal of the
conducting power of a conductor, is properly measured by a
velocity. The critical velocity, which measures the conducting
power in electrostatic reckoning and the resistance in electro-
magnetic, of one and the same conductor, measures the number
of electrostatic units in the electromagnetic unit of electric
quantity.
Without waiting for the assembling of the International Com-
mittee charged with the final determination of the Ohm, one of
its most distinguished members, Lord Rayleigh, has, with his
collaborateuse, Mrs. Sidgwick, cont nued bis important investi-
gation in this direction at the Cavendish Laboratory, and has
lately placed before the Royal Society a result which will pro-

Professor E. Wiedemann, of Leipzig, has lately called atten-
tim to the importance of having the Ohm determined in the
mo-t accurate manner possible, and enumerates four distinct
methods, all of which shou'd unquestionably be tried with a
view of obtaining concordant results, because upon its accuracy
will depend the whole future system of measurement of energy
of whatever form.
The word Energy was first used by Young in a scientific
serse, and represents a conception of recent da'e, being the out-
come of the labours of Carnot, Mayer, Joule, Grove, Claudius, Clerk-Maxwell, Thomson, Stokes. Helicholtz, Macquorn-
Rankine, and other labourers, who have acco nplished for the
science regarding the forces in Nature what we owe to Lavoi-
sier, Dalton, Berzelius, Liebig, and others, as regards Chemistry.
In this short word Energy we find all the efforts in nature, in-
cluding electricity, heat, light, chemical action, and dynamics,
equally represented, forming, to use Dr. Tyndall's apt expres-
sion, so many "modes of motion." It will readily be conceived

through their action. To avoid such interference the telephone
wires if suspended in the air require to be placed at some
distance from telegraphic line wires, and to be >upported_by
separate posts. Another way of neutralising interference consists
in twisting two separately insulated telephone wires together, so
as to form a strand, and in using the two conductors as a
metallic circuit to the exclusion of the earth; the working
current will, in that case, receive equal and opposite inductive
influences, and will therefore remain unaffected by them. On
the other hand two insulated wires instead of one are required
for working one set of instruments; and a serious increase in
the cost of installation is thus caused. To avoid this Mr. Jacob has lately suggested a plan of combining pairs of such metallic
circuits again into separate working pairs, and these again with
other working pairs, whereby the total number of telephones
capable of being worked without interference is made to equal
the total number of single wires employed. The working of
telephones and telegraphs in metallic circuit has the further
advantage that mutual volta induction between the outgoing and
returning currents favours the transit, and neutralises on the
other hand the retarding influence caused by charge in under-
ground or submarine conductors. These conditions are particu-
larly favourable to underground line wires, which possess other
important advantages over the still prevailing overground system,

in that they are unaffected by atmospheric electricity, or by
sno .v-storms and heavy gales, \vhich at not very rare intervals of
time put us back to pre-telegraphic days, when the letter-carrier
was our swiftest messenger.
The underground system of telegraphs, first introduced into
Germany by Werner Siemens in the years 1847-8, had to yield
for a time to the overground system owing to technical difficulties,
but it has been again resorted to within the last four years, and
multiple land cables of solid construction now connect all the
important towns of that country. The first cost of such a
system isno doubt considerable (being about 38/. per kilometre
of conductor as against 81. IOS. the cost of land lines); but as
the underground wires are exempt from frequent repairs and
renewals, and as they insure continuity of service, they are
decidedly the cheaper and better in the end. The experience
afforded by the early introduction of the underground system in
Germany, was not, however, without its beneficial results, as it
brought to light the phenomena of lateral induction, and of faults
in the in-ulating coating, matters which had to be understood
before submarine telegraphy could be attempted with any
reasonable prospect of success.
Regarding the transmission of power to a distance the electric
current has now entered the lists in competition with compressed air, the hydraulic accumulator, and the quick running rope as
used at Schaffbausen to utilise the power of the Rhine fall. The

accomplished with no further loss than is due to such incidental
causes as friction and the heating of wires; these in a properly
designed dynamo-electric machine do not exceed IO per cent.,
as shown by ltr. john Hopkinson, and, judging from recent
experiments of my own, a ~till nearer approach to ultimate per-
fection is attainable. Adhering, however, to Dr. Hopkinson's determination for fafetys sake, and assuming the same per-
centage in reconverting the current into mechanical effect, a total
loss of I9 per cent, results. To this loss must be added that
through electrical resi-tance in the connecting line wires, which
depends upon their length and conductivity, and that due to
heating by friction ofthe working parts of the machine. Taking
these as being equal to the internal losses incurred in the double
process of conversion, there remains a u<eful effect of too _
38 = 62 percent., attainable at a distance, which agrees with
experimental results, although in actual practice it would not be
safe at present to expect more than 50 per cent, of ultimate
useful effect, to allow for all mechanical lo=ses.
In using cornpre~sed air or water for the transmission of power
the loss cannot be taken at less than 50 per cent., and as it
depends upon fluid resistance it increases with distance more
rapidly than in the case of electricity. Taking the loss of effect

but in this case it would obviously be impossible for it to com-
pete in point of economy with the direct combustion of fuel for
the attainment of ordinary degrees of heat. Bumen and St.
Claire DeviJJe have taught us, however, that combustion be-
comes extremely slujgish when a temperature of i,8co° C. has
been reached, and for effects at temperatures exceeding that
limit the electric furnace will protably find advantageous appli-
cations. Its specific advantage consists in being apparently
unlimited in the degree of heat attainable, thus opening out a
new field of investigation to the chemist and metallurgi t.
Tungsten has been melted in such a furnace, and 8 pounds of
platinum have been reduced from the cold to the liquid condition
in 20 minute <.
The largest and most extensive application of electric energy
at the present time is to lighting, but, considering how much of
late has been said and written for and against this new illumi-
nant, I shall here confine myself to a few general remarks.
Joule has shown that if an electric current is passed through a
conductor, the whole of the energy lost by the current is con-
verted into beat; or, if the resis'ance be localised, into radiant
energy comprising heat, light, and actinic rays. Neither the low

heat rays nor the ultra-violet of highest refrangibility affect the
retina, and may be regarded as lost energy, the effective rays
being those between the red and violet of the spec rum, which
in their combination produce the efTcct of while light.
Regarding the pr portion of luminous to non-luminous rays
proceeding from an electric arc or incandescent wire, we have a
most valuable investigation by Dr. Tyndall, recorded in his
work on "Radiant Heat." Dr. Tyndall shows that the lumi-
nous rays from a platinum wire heated to its highest point of
incandescence, which may be taken at 1,700° C, formed ^'Tth
part of the total radiant energy emitted, and y'^th part in the
case of an arc light worked by a battery of 50 Grove s element*.
In order to ap^ly these valuable data to the case of electric
lighting by means of dynam?-currents, it is necessary in the first
place to determine what is the power of 50 Grove's elements of
the size used by Dr. Tyndall, expressed in the practical scale of
uni's as n >w establi-hed. From a few experiment lately under-
taken for myself, it would appear that 50 such cells have an
electro-motive force of 985 Volts, and an internal resistance of
135 Ohcns, giving a current of 7*3 Amperes when the cells are
short-circuited. The resistance of a regulator such as Dr. Tyn-
dall used in his experiments may be taken at 10 Ohms, the
98-5
current produced in the arc would be

peres (allowing one Ohm for the leads), and the power con-
sumed 10 x 4" = 160 Watts; the light power of such an arc
would be about 150 candles, and, comparing this with an
arc of 3,308 candles produced by 1,162 Watts, we find that

22 times the amount of light measured horizontally. If there-

visible as light, it follows that in a powerful arc of 3,300 candles,
 x > or fully J, are luminous rays. In the case of the in-

in practice that nine times as much po ' er has to be expended as
in the case of the arc light; hence J x J = rr Part °' tne power
is given out as lumiuous rays, as against ^th in Dr. Tyndall's
incandescent platinuma result sufficiently approximate con-
sidering the wide difference of conditions under which the two
are compared.
These results are not only of obvious practical value, but they
seem to establish a fixed relation between current, temperature,
and light produced, which may serve as a means to determine

present, we find from a Government return that the capital in
vested in gasworks in England, other than those of local author-
ties, amounts to 30,000,000/. ; in these 4,281,048 tons of coal
are converted annually, producing 43,000 million cubic feet of
gas, and about 2,800,000 tons of coke; whereas the total
amount of coal annually converted in the United Kirgdom
may be estimated at 9,000,000 tons, and the by-pr..ducts there-
from at 500,000 tons of tar, 1,000,000 tons of ammonia liquor,
and 4,000,000 tons of coke, according to the returns kindly
furnished me by the managers of many of the gasworks and cor-
porations. To these may be added say 120,000 tons of sulphur,
which up to the present time is a waste product.
Previous to the year 1856that is to say, before Mr. W. H. Perkin had invented his practical process, based chiefly upon the
theoretical investigations of Hoffman, regarding the coal-tar
bases and the chemical constitution of indigothe value of coal-
tar in London w as scarcely a halfpenny a gallon, and in country
places gas-makers were glad to give it away. Up to that time
the coal-tar industry had consisted chirfly in separating the tar
by distillation into naphtha, creosote, oils, and pitch. A few
distillers, however, made small quantities of benzene, which had
been first shownby Mansfielo, in 1849to exist in coal-tar
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
naphtha mixed with toluene, cumene, &c. The discovery, in
1856, of the mauve or aniline purple gave a great impetus to the
coal-tar trade, inasmuch as it m cessitated the separation of large
quantities of benzene, or a mixture of benzene and toluene, from
the naphtha. The trade was further increased by the discovery
of the magenta cr rosaniline dye, which required the same pro-
ducts for its preparation. In the meantime, carbolic acid was
gradually introduced into commerce, chiefly as a disinfectant,
but also for the production of colouring matter.
The next most important development arose from the dis-
covery by Grsebe and Liebermann that alizarine, the colouring
principle of the madder root, was allied to anthracene, a hydro-
carbon existing in coal-tar. The production of this colouring
matter from anthracene followed, and is now one of the most
important operations connected with tar distilling. The success
of the alizarine made in this manner has been so great that it has
almost entirely superseded the useof madder, which is now culti-
vated to only a comparatively small extent. The most important
colouring matters recently introduced are the azo-scarlets. They
have called into use the coal-tar hydrocarbons, xylene and
cumene. Naphthalene is also used in their preparation. These
splendid dyes have replaced cochineal in many of its applica-
tions, and have thus seriously interfered with its use. The
discovery of artificial indigo by Professor Baeyer is of great
interest. For the preparation of this colouring matter toluene
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
is required. At pre ent artificial indigo does not compete
seriously with the natural product ; but should it eventually be
prepared in quantity from toluene, a further stimulus will be
given to the coal-tar trade.
The colour industry utilises even now practically all ihe ben-
zene, a large proportion of the solvent nap: ha, all the anthracene,
and a portion of the napthalire resulting from the distillation of
coal-tar; and the value of the colouring mat'er thu^ produced is
estimated by Mr. Perkin at 3,350,000/.
The demand for ammonia may be taken as unlimited, on
account of its high agricultural value as a mai ure; and, con-
sidering the failing supply of guano and the growing necessity
for stimulating the fertility of our soil, an increased production
of ammonia may be rtgarded as a matter of national in porta nee,
for the supply of which we have to look almost exclusively to
our gasworks. The present production of 1,000,000 tons of
liquor yields 95,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia; which, taken
at 20/. tor. a ton, represents an annual value of i,947,coo/.

NATURE
The greater efficiency of gas as a fuel results chiefly from the
circumstance that a pound of gas yields in combustion 22,000
heat units, or exactly double the heat produced in the combustion
of a pound of ordinary coal. This extra heating power is due
partly to the freedom of the gas from earthy constituents, but
chiefly to the heat imparted to it in effecting its distillation.
Recent experiments with gas-burners have shown that in this
direction also there is much room for improvement.
The amount of light given out by a gas flame depends upon
the temperature to which the particles of solid carbon in the
flame are raised, and Dr. Tyndall has shown that of the radiant
energy set up in such a flame, only the ^th part is luminous; the
hot products of combustion carry off at lea-t four times as much
energy as is radiatci, so that not more than one hundredth part
of the heat evolved in combustion is c inverted into light. This
proportion could be improved, however, by increasing the tem-
perature of combustion, « hieh may be effected either by intensi-
fied air currents or by regenerative action. Supposing that the
heat of the products of combustion could be communi-
cated to metallic surfaces, and be transferred by conduction
or otherwise to the atmospheric air supporting combustion in the
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
flame, we should be able to increase the temperature accumu-
latively to any point within the limit of dissociation; this limit
may be fixed at about 2,300° C, and cannot be very much below
that of the electric arc. At such a temperature the proportion
of luminous rays to the total heat produced in combustion would
be more than doubled, and the brilliancy of the li^ht would at
the same time be greatly increased. Thus improved, gas-lighting
may continue its rivalry with electric lighting both as regards
economy and brilliancy, and such rivalry must necessarily result
in great public advantage.
In the domestic grate radiant energy of inferior intensity is
required, and I for one do not agree with those who would like
to see the open fireplace of this country, superseded by the con-
tinental stove. The advantages usually claimed for the open
fireplace are, that it is cheerful, "pokable," and conducive to
ventilation, but to these may be added another of even greater
importance, viz., that the radiant heat which it emits passes
through the transparent air without warming it, and imparts heat
only to the solid walls, floor, and furniture of the room, which
are thus constituted the heating surfaces of the comparatively
cool air of the apartments in contact with them. In the case of
stoves the heated air of the room causes deposit of moisture upon
the walls in heating them, and gives rise to mildew and germs
injurious to health. It is, I think, owing to this circumstance
that upon entering an apartment one can immediately perceive
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
whether or not it is heated byian open fireplace; nor is the un-
pleasant sensation due to stove-heating completely removed by
mechanical ventilation; there is, moreover, no good reason why
an open fireplace should not be made as economical and smoke-
less as a stove or hot-water apparatus.
In the production of mechanical effect from heat, gaseous fuel
also presents most striking advantages, as will appear from the
following consideration. When we have to deal with the ques-
tion of converting mechanical into electrical effect, or vice v,rsd,
by means of the dynamo-electrical machine, we have only to
consider what are the equivalent values of the two forms of
energy, and what precautions are necessary to avoid losses by
the electrical resistance of conductors and by friction. The
transformation of mechanical effect into heat involves no losses
except those resulting from imperfect installation, and these may
be so completely avoided that Dr. Joule was able by this method
to determine the equivalent values of the two forms of energy.
But in attempting the inverse operation of effecting the conver-
sion of heat into mechanical energy, we find ourselves con-
fronted by the second law of thermodynamics, which says that

extent counterbalanced by the value of the steamship, which
bear-, to that of the sailing vessel per net carrying ton the pro-
ponion of 3 : 1, thus reducing the ratio in favour of steam ship-
ping as 1329 to lo"38, or in round numbers as 4:3. In
testing this result by the charges of premium for insurance, the
variable circumstances of distance, nature of cargo, season and
v >yage have to be taken into account; but judging from in-
formation received from shipowners and underwriters of
undoubted authority, I find that the relative insurance paid for
the two classes of vessel represents an average of 30 per cent, in
favour of steam ship, ing, agreeing very closely with the above
deductions derived from statistical information.
In considering the question how the advantages thus established
in favour of steam-shipping could be further improved, attention
should be called in the first place to the material employed in
their construction. A new material was introduced for this pur-
pose by the Admiralty in 187678, when they constructed at
Pembroke dockyard the two steam corvettes, the Iris and Mer-
cury, of mild steel. The peculiar qualities of this material are
such as to have enabled shipbuilders to save 20 per cent, in the
weight of the ship's hull, and to increase to that extent its carrying

capacity. It combines with a strength 30 per cent, superior to
that of iron such extreme toughness, that in the case of collision
the side of the vessel has been found to yield or bulge several
feet without showing any sign of rupture, a quality affecting the
question of sea risk very favourably. When to the use of this
material there are added the advantages derived fr >m a double
bottom, and from the division of the ship's hold by means ol
bulkheads of solid construction, it is difficult to conceive how
such a ve-sel could peiish by colli-ion either with another vessel
or with a sunken rock. The spaces between the two bottoms
are not lost, because they form convenient chambers for water
ballast, but powerful pumps should in all cases be] added to
nuet emergencies.
The following statement of the number and tonnage of vessels
building and preparing to be built in the United Kingdom on the
30th of June last, which has been kindly furnished me by
Lloyd's, is of interest as showing that wooden ships are fast
becoming obsolete, and that even iron is beginning to yield its
I lace, both as regards steamers and sailing ships, to the new
material mild steel; it also shows that by far the greater number
of vessels now building are ships of large dimensions propelled

If to the improvements already achieved could be added an
engine of half the weight of the present steam engine and
boilers, and working with only half the present expenditure of
fuel, a further addition of 30 per cent, could be made to the

vessels would be sufficient to restrict the use of sailing craft
chiefly to the regattas of this and neighbouring ports.

stituti >n for the chef-cTieuvrc of engineering erected by John
Smeaton more than 100 years ago. The condemnation of that
structure was no', however, the consequence of any fault of
construction, but was caused by inroads of the sea upon the rock
supporting it. The new lighthouse, designed and executed by
Mr., now Sir James Douglas, engineer of Trinity House, has
been erected in the incredibly short time of less than two years,
and bids fair to be worthy of its famed predecessor. Its height
above hi^h water is 130 feet, as compared with 72 feet, the
height of Telford's s'ructure, which gives its powerful light a
considerably increased range. The system originally suggested
by Sir William Thomson some years ago, of distinguishing one
light from another by flashes following at varied intervals, has
been adopted by the Elder Brethren in this as in other recent
lights in the modified form introduced by Dr. John Hopkinson,
in wh'ch the principle is applied to revolving lights, so as to
obtain a greater amount of light in the flash.
The ge logical difficulties which for sometime threatened the
accomplishment of the St. Gothard Tunnel, have been happily

be constituted the shipping port for those part'.
Whether we shall be able to connect the English with the
French rail -ay system by means of a tunnel below the English
Channel is a question that appears dependent at this moment
rather upon military and political than technical and financial
considerations. The occurrence of a stratum of impervious grey
chalk, at a convenient depth below the bed of the Channel,
minimises the engineering difficulties in the way, and must
influence the financial question involved. The protest lately
raised against its accomplishment can hardly be looked upon as
a public verdict, but seems to be the result of a natural desire to
pause pending the institution of careful inquiries. These in-
quiries have been made by a Royal Scientific Commission, and
will be referred for further consideration to a mixed Parliamen-
tary Committee, upon whose Report it must depend whether the
natural spirit of commercial enterprise has to yield in this

of the temperature of explosion of gun-cotton showed it to be
about double that of the explosion of gunpowder. One of the
effects observed to be produced by this sudden enormous de-
velopment of heat was the covering of the inner surfaces of
the steel explosion-vessel with a net-work of cracks, small por-
tions of the surface being sometimes actually fractured, the
explosion of charges of gun-cotton up to 2 5 kilos in perfectly
closed chambers, with development of pressures approaching to
50 tons on the square inch, constitutes alone a perfec.ly novel
feat in investigations of this class.
Messrs. Noble and Abel are also continuing their researches
upon fired gunpowder, being at present occupied with an
inquiry into the influence exerted upon the chemical metamor-
phosis and ballistic effects of fired gunpowder by variation in its
composition, their attention being direc ed especially to the dis-
covery of the cause of the more or less considerable erosion of
the interior surface of guns produced by the exploring charge
an effect which, notwithstanding the application of devices in
the building up of the charge specially directed to the proerva-
tion of the gun's bore, have become so serious that, with the
enormous charges now used in our heavy guns, the erosive

action on the surface of the bore produced by a single round is
distinctly perceptible. As there appeared to be prima facie
reasons why the erosive action of powder upon the surface of
the bore at the high temperatures developed should be at any
rate in part due to its one component sulphur, Noble and Abel
have made comparative experiments with powders of usual com-
position and with others in which the proportion of sulphur was
considerably increased, the extent of erosive action of the
products escaping from the explosion vessel under high tension
being carefully determined. With small charges a particular
powder containing no sulphur was found to exert very little
erosive action as compared with ordinary cannon powder; but
another powder, containing the maximum proportion of -sulphur
tried (15 per cent.), was found equal to it under these conditions.
and exerted very decidedly less erosive action than it, when
larger charges were reached. Other important contributions to
our knowledge of the action of fired gunpowder in guns, as well
as decided improvements in the gunpowder manufactured for the
very heavy ordnance of the present day, may be expected to
result from a continuance of these investigations. Prof. Carl
Himly, of Kiel, having been engaged upon investigations of a
similar nature, has lately proposed a gunpowder in which hydro-
carbons precipitated from solution in naphtha take the place of
the charcoal and sulphur of ordinary powder, this powder has

dry," may hereafter be unnecessary.;
The extraordinary difference of condition, before and after its
ignition, of such matter as constitutes an explosive agent leads
us up to a consideration of the aggregate state of (matter under
other circumstances. As early as 1776 Alexander Volta observed
that the volume of glass was changed under the influence of
electrification, by what he termed electrical pressure. Dr. Kerr,
Govi, and others have followed up the same inquiry, which isat
present continued chiefly by Dr. George Quincke, of Heidelberg,
who finds (hat temperature, as well as chemical constitution of
the dielectric under examination, exercises a determining influ-
ence upon the amount and character of the change of volume
effected by electrification ; that the change of volume may under
certain circumstances be effected instantaneously as in flint glass,
or only slowly as in crown glass, and that the elastic limit of
lmth is diminished by electrification, whereas in the case of mica
and of guttapercha an increase of elasticity takes place.
Still greater strides are being made at the present time towards
a clearer perception of the condition of matter when particles

5. That striae are not merely loci in which electrical is converted
into luminous energy, but are actual aggregations of matter.
This last conclusion was based mainly upon experiments made
with an induction coil excited in a new wayviz. directly by an
alternating machine, without the intervention of a commutator
or condenser. This mode of excitement promises to be one of
great importance in spectroscopic work, as well as in the study
of the discharge in a magnetic field, partly on account of the
simplification which it permits in the construction of induction
coils, but mainly on account of the very great increase of strength
in the secondary currents to which it gives rise.
These investigations assume additional importance when we
view them in connection with solarI may even say stellar
physics, for evidence is augmenting in favour of the view that
interstellar space is not empty, but is filled with highly attenuated
matter of a nature such as may be put into our vacuum tubes.

constitution and phy-ical condition of the sun, the stars, the
comets, and the far distant nebulre, which have yielded spectro-
scopic photographs under the skilful management of Dr.
Huggins, and Dr. Draper of New York. Armed with greatly
improved apparatus, the phy-ical astronomer has been able to
reap a rich harvest of scientific information during the short
periods of the last two solar eclipsesthat of 1879, visible in
America, and that of May last, observed in E»ypt by Lockyer,
Schuster, and by Continental observers of high standing. The
result of this last eclip e expedition has been summed up as
follows:"Different temperature levels have been discovered
in the solar atmosphere; the constitution of the corona has
now the possibility of being determined, and it is proved to
shine with its own light. A suspicion has been aroused once
more as to the existence of a lunar atmosphere, and the position
of an important line has been discovered. Hydro-carbons do
not exist close to the sun, but may in space between us and it."
To me personally these reported results possess peculiar inte-
rest, for in March last I ventured to bring before the Royal
Society a speculation regarding the conservation of solar energy,
which was based U[ on tbe three following postulates, viz. :
1. That aqueous vapour and carbon compounds are present in
s ellar or interplanetary space.
2. That these gaseous compounds are capable of being disso-
ciated by radiant solar energy while in a state of extreme
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
attenuation.
3. That the effect of solar rotation is to draw in dissociated
vapours upon the polar surfaces, and to eject them after com-
bustion has taken place back into space equatorially.
It is therefore a matter of peculiar gratification to me that the
results of observation here recorded give considerable support to
that speculation. The luminous equatorial extensions of the sun
which the American observations revealed in such a striking
manner (with which I was not acquainted when writing my
paper) were absent in Egypt; but the outflowing equatorial
streams 1 suppose to exist could only be rendered visible by re-
flected sunlight, when mixed with dust produced by exceptional
solar disturbances or by electric discharge; and the occasional
appearance of such luminous extensions would serve only to dis-
prove the hypothesis entertained by some, that they are divided
planetary matter, in which case their appearance should be per-
manent. Prof. Langley, of Pittsburg, has shown, by means of
his bolometer, that the solar actinic rays are absorbed chiefly in
the solar instead of in the terrestrial atmosphere, and Capt.
Abney has found by his new photometric method that absorp-

the limitations to which our methods are necessarily subject, and
as far as possible to estimate the extent to which our results are
uncertain. The comparison of estimates of uncertainty made
before and after the execution of a set of mea urements may
sometimes be humiliating, but it is always instructive.
Even when our results show no greater discrepancies than we
were originally prepared for, it is well to err on the side of
modesty in estimating their trustworthiness. The history of
science teaches only too plainly the lesson that no single method
is absolutely to be relied upon, that sources of error lurk where
they are least expected, and that they may escape the notice of
the most experienced and conscientious worker. It is only by
the concurrence of evidence of various kinds and from various
sources that practical certainty may at last be attained, and com
plete confidence justified. Perhaps I may be allowed to illustrate
my meaning by reference to a subject which has engaged a good
deal of my attention for the last two yearsthe absolute measure-
ment of electrical resistance. The unit commonly employed in
this country is founded upon experiments made about twenty
years ago by a distinguished committee of this Association, and
was intended to represent an absolute resistance of to9. C.G.S.,

i.e. one ohm. The method employed by the committee at the
recommendation of Sir W. Thomson (it had been originally
proposed by Weber) consisted in observing the deflection from
the magnetic meridian of a needle suspended at the centre of a
coil of insulated wire, which formed a closed circuit, and was
made to revolve with uniform and known speed about a vertical
axis. From the speed and deflection in combination with the
m an radius of the coil and the number of its turns, the abso-
lute resistance of the coil, and thence of any other standard,
can be determined.
About ten years later Kohlrausch attacked the problem by
another method, which it would take too long to explain, and
arrived at the result that the B.A. unit was equal to 1-02 ohms
about two per cent, too large. Rowland, in America, by a
comparison between the steady battery current flow in;* in a
primary coil with the transient current developed in a secondary
coil when the primary current is reversed, found that the B.A.
unit was 991 ohm-. Lorentz, using a different method again,
found '980, while H. Weber, from di-tinct experiments, arrived
at the conclusion thru the B.A. unit was correct. It will be seen
that the results obtained by these highly competent observers
range over about four per cent. Two new determinations have
lately been male in the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge, one
by myself with the method of the revolving coil, and another
by Mr. (jlazebrook, who used a modification of the method

followed by Rowland, with the result that the B.A. unit is -986
ohms. I am now engaged upon a third determination, using a
method which is a modification of that of Lorentz.
In another important part of the field of experimental science,
where the subject-maiter is ill understood, and the work is
qualitative rather than quantitative, success depends more di-
rectly upon sagacity and genius. It must be admit ed that much
labour spent in this kind of work is ill-directed. Bulky records
of crude and uninterpreted observations are not science, nor
even in many cases the raw material out of which science will be
constructed. The door of experiment stands always open; and
when the question is ripe, and the man is found, he will nine
times out of ten find it necessary to go through the work again.
Observations made by the way, and under favourable conditions,
may often give rise to valuable suggestions, but these must be
tested by experiment, in which the conditions are simplified to
the utmost, before they can lay claim to acceptance.
When an unexpected effect is observed, the question will arise
whether or not an explanation can be found upon admitted
principles. Sometimes the answer can be quickly given; but
more often it will hippen that an assertion of what ought to

Either the theory is upset, or the observations, if not altogether
faulty, are found susceptible of another interpretation. The
difficulty is greatest when the necessary conditions are uncertain,
and their fulfilment rare and uncontrollable. In many such
cases an attitude of reserve, in expectation of further evidence,
is the only wise one. Premature judgments err perhaps as much
on one side as on the other. Certainly in the past many extra-
ordinary observations have met with an excessive incredulity. I
may ins ance the fire-balls which sometimes occur during violent
thunderstorms. When the telephone was first invented, the
early reports of its performances were discredited by many on
quite insufficient grounds.
It would be interesting, but too difficult and delicate a task,
to enumerate and examine the various important questions which
remain still undecHed from the opposition of direct and indirect
evidence. Merely as illustrations I will mention one or two in
which I happen to have been interested. It has been sought to
remedy the inc mvenience caused by exce-sive reveberation of
sound in cathedrals and other large unfurnished buildings by
stre'ching wires overhead from one wall to another. In some
ca-es no difference has been perceived, but in others it is thought

that advantage has been gained. From a theoretical point of
view it is difficult to believe that the wires could be of service.
It is known that the vibrations of a wire do not communicate
themselves in any appreciable degree directly to the air, but
require the intervention of a sounding-board, from which we
may infer that vibrations in the air would not readily communi-
cate them elves to stretched wires. It seems more likely that
the advantage supposed to have been gained in a few cases is
imaginary than that the wires should really have played the
part attributed to them.
The other subject on which, though with diffidence, I should like to make a remark or two, is that of I'rout's law, according
to which the atomic weights of the elements, or at any rate of
many of them, stand in simple relation to that of hydrogen.
Some chenists have reprobated strongly the importation of
a priori views into the consideration of the question, and main-
tain that the only numbers worthy of recognition are the imme-
diate results of experiment. Others, more impressed by the
argu Dent that the close approximations to simple numbers cannot
be merely fortuitou-, and more alive to the inevitable imper-
fections of our measurements, consider that the experimental
evidence against the simple number, is of a very slender cha-
racter, balanced, if not outweighed, by the a priori argument in
favour of simplicity. The subject is eminently one for further
experiment; and as it is now engaging the attention of chemists,
we may look forward to the settlement of the question by the

present generation. The time has perhaps come when a re-
determination of the densities of the principal gases may be
desirablean undertaking for which I have made some pre-
parations.
If there is any truth in the views that I have been endeavouring
to impress, our meetings in this section are amply justified. If
the progress of science demands the comparison of evidence
drawn from different sources, and fully appreciated only by
minds of different order, what may we not gain from the oppor-
tunities here given for public discussion, and, perhaps more
valuable still, private interchange of opinion? Let us endeavour,
one and all, to turn them to the best account.

molecules than they represent the solar system; but unfortu-
nately we cannot prevent beginners from regarding them as
pictures, and moulding their ideas upon them. They present
something easily grasped by the infant mind, and schoolmasters
are fond of them; but only those who have each year to combat
a fresh crop of mi'cmceptions and false mechanical notions
engendered by them, can be aware how much they hinder, I
won't say the advance, but the spread of real chemical science.
If it be true that the illustrations of an artist like the late Hablot
Browne give to our conceptions of the characters of a story a
more definite and permanent, though perhaps a much modified
form of what the au'hor of the story intended to portray, it is
equally true that the illustrations by which some, even great
names among us, have tried to make us fancy that we had a true
conception of some natural process have become so fixed in our
minds, as to prevent our realising the true meaning of nature.
What, then, is the progre-s which I think has been made in
physical chemistry? In the first place, notwithstanding the
slowness with which new ideas replace old familiar images, the
molecular theories developed by Clausius, Clerk-Maxwell, Boltz-
mann, and by Sir W. 1 homson, have been long enough before the

world to have greatly loosened the hold upon our minds of many
old notions. The rigid, unbreakable, impenetrable atoms of the
Epicurean philosophy made familiar to us by Lucretius always
presented difficulties which w»re only perhaps exceeded by those
of the elastic atmospheres with which modern philosophers fancied
them to be surrounded; but now the vortex theory, » hether we
think it probable or not, at least gives us a standing ground for
the assertion that the supposed impenetrability of matter and the
curious compound of nucleus and atmosphere which has been
invented to account for elasticity are nut necessary assumptions.
The kinetic theory of gases has analysed for us the different
motions of the molecules in a mass of matter, and has facilitated
the conception of the part which heat plays in chemical action.
Hence we have had of late several attempts to reduce to a form
susceptible of mathematical calculation the problems of chemistry.
Most of these attempts have proceeded on the well-known
mechanical principle that the change of vis viva of a system in
passing from an initial to a final configuration is independent of
the intermediate stages through which it may have passed so long
as the external conditions are unaltered; and on the principle of
the dissipation of energy, that is to say, on the condition that the
state of the system, if it be a stable one, must be such that the
energy run down in reaching it is a maximum. These principles
have been applied successfully to the solution of some particular
cases of the equilibrium between a mixture of chemicals by Wil-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
lard Gibbs, Berthelot, and others. By the first-mentioned
principle, all consideration of the intermediate stages by which
the final re ult is reached are avoided. Quite recently Lemoinne
has attacked the same problem on another principle. His
principle is that of an equilibrium of antagonistic reactions in a
mixture of materials, a mobile equilibrium such as we are now
familiar with, dependent on compensating effects; but he does
not seem able to solve the problem in any great number of cases.
In fact, the difficulty does not now lie so much in expressing
mathematically the conditions of the problem as in the defect of
knowledge which depends upon experiment. And it is just
in this that I think the outlook most hopeful. In some cases the
patient work of weighing and measuring and comparing, which
is necessary to make our theoretic speculations of any substantial
value, has been already done for us. The publication, three
years since, of Berthelot's essay on chemical mechanics has given
us in a collected form a large quantity of data of the first im-
portance; and now I am glad to say that the long labours of
another worker in the same field, Thomsen of Copenhagen, are
in course of publication in a handy form. I think these two in-
vestigators have done more than any one else of late years

all multiples of that of hydrogen. This famous hypothesis has
gone up and down in the scale of credibility many times during
the present century. About seventeen years ago the publication
of Stas' new determinations of combining numbers, carrried out
on a scale never before attempted, and with all the refinements
which the growth of our knowledge could suggest, was thought
to have given it its deathblow. But a reaction has set in
si ce that time. The periodic recurrence of the properties
of elements with regulir additions to the atomic weights like
octaves on a musical scale, put forcibly before us by
Mendelejeff, makes it difficult not to think that there is a
simple relation between the atomic weights, though there may
be causes producing slight perturbations of such a relation.
Quite recently a fresh revision of the combining weights has
been made on the other side of the Atlantic by I'rof. F. W.
Clarke. He has collected all the determinations made by
different observers, aid after rejecting such as from defective
methods were untrustworthy, has applied to the remainder such
corrections as newer excellences have suggested, and then
deduced from the corrected numbers the most probable values
by the meth< ds of the theory of errors. Prof. Clarte has done

a piece of work of the highest utility, for which chemists must
be grateful; nevertheless he has not carried the revision so far
as it might be carried. He has, to begin with, rightly separated
the several sets of observations, and deduced the most probable
number for each set by itself, I ut in combining the various sets
for the final determination of the numbers adopted, he has
treated the results obtained by different methods as if they were
a set of observations all presumably of equal value, so that the
most probable numbers cou'd be deduced by the method of least
squares. He has not attempted any discussion of the different
11 ethoels with a view to an e.-iimate of the relative values of the
remits obtained by them, nor made any difference between the
values of the figures deduced from operations on the large scale
employed by Stas, and those arrived at < n the small scales of
other observers. Any sort of handicapping of methods is no
doubt a very difficult and delicate operation, and requires more
than the judgment of an Aduiiial Kou-, but without it the
question whether the numbers adopud are the best obtainable,
will always be an open one. It is, however, a very n teworthy
fact tl'at in almost every ca e the numbers deduced from Stas'
experiments taken by themselves, coincide very closely with the
most probable numbers derived by the method of least squares
from the whole of the recorded e timates. On the whole, Prof.
Clarke concludes that Prout's hypothesis, as modified by Dumas,
is still an open question; tha' is to ;ay, his final numbers differ

from whole multiples of a common unit by quantities which lie
within the limits of errors of observation and experiment.
Let us turn again to the evidence afforded by our most power-
ful instrument for inspecting the inner constitution of matter, the
spectiocope. A few years ago Mr. Lockyer supposed that the
coincidence of rays emitted by different chemical elements, par-
ticularly when those rays were developed in the spark of a
powerful induction-coil and in the high temperatures of the sun
and stars, gave evidence of a common cement in the composition
of the metals which produced the coincident rays. Such an
argument could not be drawn from the coincidences unless they
were exact, and the identity of the lines could only be tested by
means of spectroscopes of great resolving power. i!y the u>e of
the well-known Rutherford gratings, Young, in America, had
found that most of the solar lines which had been ascribed to
two metals were in reality double, and Prof. Dewar and I,
working on the terrestrial ele.nents in the electric arc, had found
the actual coincidences to be very few indeed. These observa-
tions, even with a Rutherford grating, were delicate enough;
but quite recently M. Fievez, of the Brussels Observatory, has brought to bear on this question a spectroscope of unexampled

Dr. Siemens supposes the gases whic 1 pervade the planetary
space to be not only of the same kind as the components of our
own atmosphere, which, on the kinetic theory of gases diffuse
through that space, but also such gases as are not found in
our air, but are found occluded in meteorites which may be
supposed to have acquired them in their previous wanderings.
Amongst these he specially mentions hydrocarbons which form
the self-luminous part of most comets. It is to these gases,
together with aqueous vapour, and carbonic acid, that he ascribes
the principal part in the conservation of solar energy. That
compound gases at the extremely low pressure of the planetary
space are decomposed by solar radiation is not inconsistent with
the laws of dissociation, for it is quite possible that some com-
pounds may be decomposed at ordinary temperatures by mere
reduction of pressure, and the radiation absorbed will be the
more effective, because it will directly affect the vibratory motion
within the molecule, and may well produce chemical decomposi-

increased temperature. Dr. Siemens, moreover, adduces a
remarkable experiment in confirmation of his supposition. We
know, too, the power which our atmosphere, and especially the
water vapour in it, has of absorbing the infra-red rays, and that
amongst the Fraunhofer lines some of the strongest groups are
due to aqueous vapour, and the capital observation made by the
spectroscopic observers at the last total eclipse, that the group
of lines known as "B," which is one of those produced by
aqueous vapour, is greatly strengthened when the sun's light
passes by the edge of the moan ani so through the lunar atmo-

like our atmosphere, are diffused through space and concentrated
about the planets. But if it be true that the compounds are
decomposed by absorbing the sun's rays, we ou^ht to find in our
atmosphere the products of decomposition, we ought to find in
it free hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and acetylene or some other
hydrocarbons. The hydrogen from its small specific gravity
would not be concentrated in the lower regions of our atmo-
sphere in the same proportion as the denser gases, but carbonic
oxide and hydrocarbons could not fail to be detected in the air if
they formed any sensible proportion of the gases in the planetary
space. That a large portion of the solar radiation is intercepted
before it reaches the earth, is no doubt true, for there are no t
only the dark bands which are increased by our atmosphere, and

pervading the space between us and the sun, but there is a con-
tinuous absorption of the ultra-violet spectrum beyond the line
U, and Cornu has found that this absorption is not sensibly
affected by our atmosphere, so that the substance, whatever it
may be which produces it, may be an agent in the process
imagined by Dr. Siemens, but cannot be the means ot restoring
to the sun any portion of the radiant energy which reaches our
distance from him.
Dr. Siemens expl ins the self-luminous character of comets by
the theory that the streams of meteoric stones, of which they
are supposed to consi-t, bring fro 11 stellar space hydrocarbon
and other gases occluded within them; and that in consequence
of the rise of temperature due t > the frictional resistance of such
a divided mass moving with enormous velocity, aided by
attractive condensation, the occluded gases will be driven out
and burnt, the flame giving rise to the original light emitted by
the nucleus. Now the spectrum of most comets shows only the
principal bands of a Bunsen burner, and is therefore adequ.tely
explained by the flame of gas containing hydrocarbons, such as
have been found in meteorites. But Dr. Hu/gins has observed

The Researches of Francis Maitland Bai.four.
At the risk of having to be somewhat brief in my discussion of
the subject proper of this address, I must yield to the impulse
which leads me to give you some account of Balfour's work.1
Having been educated at Harrow, Balfour entered Trinity
College, Cambridge, in the year 1870. His friend and master,
Michael Foster has told us how, from the very first, besides
engaging in systematic studies which he was able to pursue with
no small degree of success, he devoted himself with passion
to original research. At the very outset Balfour engaged in
work which led to speculations of a fundamental and far-seeking
nature, and of the three embryological papers, (Studies from the
Cambridge Physiological Laboratory. Part I., 1873. Quarterly
Journal oj Microsopical Science, vol. xiii., 1873.) which he wrote
before taking his degree, two related to questions which occup;ed

his attention in a special manner to the end. One of these, "On
the Development and Growth of the Layers of the Blastoderm,"
contains several statements not afterwards maintained ; for in-
stance, as to the independent origin of the mesoblast in the
chick, where it is said "neither to originate from the epiblast
nor from the hypoblast, but to be formed coincidentally with the
latter, out of apparently similar segmentation cells." The other,
"On the Disappearance of the Primitive Groove in the Chick,"
calls attention to, and corroborates Dursy's discovery of seven
years before, and closes with a suggestion of the great hypothesis
(afterwards elaborated) that the primitive streak is a lingering
remnant of the blastopore. Balfour also wrote whilst an under-
graduate "On the Development of the Bloodvessel* in the
Chick," but it may be doubted whether he advanced our
knowledge of this obscure subject
The "Elements of Embryology," by Michael Foster and
Balfour, appeared (1874) shortly after Balfour had taken his
degree (1873), and Fo-terhas generously recorded how great was
the part his pupil took in the production of this book. The
month after taking his degree he made his first journey to Naples,
and it was whilst working there that he entered upon bis remark-

in the hypothesis previously quoted that the primitive streak is the relic of a blastopore.
At this time Balfour was working hard at his text-book of
"Comparative Embryology." His published papers were no less
numerous than before, but consisted in part of extracts from the
more speculative chapters of the forthcoming book. He, however,
published a paper, (QuarUrly Journal of Microscopical Science,
vol. xx., 1S80.) containing the results of work scattered over two
years, on the. development of Spiders. He also published a
paper (Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1881.) on the
skeleton of the paired fins, based uoo:i his work on Ela-mo-
branchs. In this he contests thi views of Gegen'iauer and
Huxley, th t the primitive fin consists of a central multi segmented
axis with m my latcr.il rays, and is most nearly retained in
Ceratodus; he rather considers the primitive form to be a
longitudinal bar running al mjthe base of the fin (basipteygium),
and giving off at right angles a series of rays which pass into the
fin. He adheres to the view expressed in the "Elasmobranch
Fishes," (p. 101.) that the vertebrate limbs are remnants of two
continuous lateral fins.
Another imp >rtant paper of the same year dealt with the
placenta. Balfour supposed that in the primitive Placentalia,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
simple foetal villi, like those of the pig, projected from the
discoidal allantoic region of the chorion into uterine crypts.
The deciduate discoidal placenta of Rodents and Insectivores
is the first stage in advance of this primitive type. Then alon^
different lines diverge the zonary placenta of Carnivora, and the
diffuse placenta of Suidae, Lemuridre, &c.; and the latter
becomes contracted down to the di coidal placenta of man, a
form in no way to be confounded with the primitive discoidal
placenta of Rodents.
He engaged also, in conjunct! m with Mr. W. N. Parker,
in a very important research; to be published in full in the
"Philosophical Transactions," on the ' Structure and Develop-
ment of Lepidosteus." This paper contains an immense amount
of new matter, both anatomically and enbryological, and shows
that Lepidosteus, though a 'true ganoid, has very marked tele-
ostean affinities.
Balfour's last published paper, (Quarterly Journal of Micro-
scopical Science, vol. xxii., 1882.) which appeared during his
recent illness, was written with the as istance of Mr. Deighton,
and related to the germinal layers of the chick. This paper
describes, in a very beautiful way, the double origin of the
mesoblast, partly from an axial strip of epiblast in the line of
the primitive streak, an 1 partly as two lateral plates differentiated
from the hypoblast in front of the primitive streak.
Before his last, fatal journey, Mr. Balfour was engaged in
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
preparing a new edition of the "Element! of Embryology,"
and in producing a very elaborate memoir on the "Anatomy
and Development of Peripatus." He had previously investi-
gated that animal, in 1879, and had cleared up the matter of its
segemental organs (overlooked by Moseley), and demonstrated
the presence of ganglia on its ventral nerve-cords.
Mr. Balfour became a member of this Association in 1871,
the year after he entered Trinity College. At the brilliant
Belfast meeting in 1874 he read his first paper before the
Association on Elasmobranch P'ishes; and this paper and
Balfour's share in the keen discussion which followed are still
remembered with admiration by many. In 1880, at Swansea,
he delivered an address, as Chairman of the sub-section of
Anatomy and Physiology, dealing with the mutual services
rendered by the evolution theory to embryology, and by embryo-
logy t> the evolution theory, with special reference to the
developmental history of the nervous system. In 1881, he was
appointed one of the two General Secretaries.
But the great text-book of comparative embryology ("Com-
parative Embryology," vol. i., 1880, vol. ii. 1881) is the real
monument of Balfour's fame. It is impossible to convey an

"acini," a word which in its primitive classical sense has been
used to designate the stone or seed of the grape or the grape
itself. The conception, indeed, which Malpighi formed of an
"acinus'' was rather that of a secreting nodule than of an
ultimate saccular or tubular recess. The "acini," however, he
believed to be in communication with the efferent ducts of the
glands to which they belonged, and through which they poured
out their proper secretion, derived in the first instance from the
blood contained in minute arteries supplied to the gland. Kuysch
(1696), known as the first celebrated injector of blood-vessels,
rinding that frequently the fluids which he forced into the blood-
vessels of glands escaped through their ducts, or made their
way into the surrounding tissues, concluded that the blood-vessels
c iinmiinic.ited directly with the interior of the glands ; these he
held to be organs which, according to the views that had long
prevailed, merely strained off from the blood certain of its more
liquid constituents. The views entertained by the most eminent
of the supporters'.of Ruysch, the illustrious Haller were expressed
by him as follows. After defining the term "acinus " to signify the
ultimate division of a gland, he remarks that "the acini consists
¦of congeries of vessels, bound firmly together with the cellular

mences from the most minute arteries by small ducts impervious to
the blood. . . . So that secretion differs from the ordinary circu-
lations of the blood in this particular, that the smallest arteries are
continuous with veins of equal or greater size, capable therefore
of receiving the blood, whilst the excretory ducts are much
smaller, in order to effect the separation of the secretion."
<Haller, p. 275.) The advocates of the Ruyschian theory
were compelled to have recourse to the most improbable hypo-
theses to explain the diversity of the secretions of different glands,
as, for example, lhat different glands secrete different liquids,
because of the difference in the diameters of the pores by which
the blood-vessels communicate with the glands ; that the different
arrangement of blood-vessels, the mode in which they divide, the
resistance which they offer to the flow of blood through them, by
modifying the pressure and velocity of the blood-flow' through
the organ, induce secretions varying in character. It is strange
to learn from Haller, as was indubitably the fact, that the great
majority of his contemporaries, such men as Peyerand Vieussens,
and even Boerhaave, adopted the Ruyschian view of the struc-
ture of glands. The opposition to Ruysch came first from
Ferrein (Kerrein, "Sur la Structure des Glands," &c, Memoircs
de I'Acad. Roy. dis Sciences de Paris, I749\ who maintained
that the kidneys essentially consist of an assembla e of convoluted
tubes, which he looked upon to be the seat of the renal secretion

tubes which a subsequent investigator, Schumlansky (Schnm-
lansky, "Dissertatio Inaugur. Anatomica de Renum structura,
A gentoreti, 1880), looked udon as taking their origin in the
acini of Malpighi, to which he referred the active part in secre-
tion. Then followed the researches of Mascagni and Cruickshank,
who found, by injecting quicksilver into the maumnry glands,
thati the ramification of the ducts of this organ terminate in
racemose follicles; though Ma-cagni still admitted a connection,
by means of open pores, between the sides of the glandular bloodvessels and the interior of the glands themselves. It was
unquestionably Professor £. H. Weber, of Leipzig, who
completely demolished the Ruschyian hypothesis, and who by
numerous researches on the salivary glands of birds and of
mammals, and on the pancreas of birds, established the general
fact of the terminatio 1 of gland ducts in blind extremities,
though with modesty he put forward his opinions as confirming
the inductions of Malpighi, expressing himself as follows:

other delicate secreting membrane, such as, for example, the
mucous membrane of pulmonary air cells.
8. The arborescent ramification of the blood-vessels accom-
pany the ducts in their development, and the reticulated
capillaries in which the bloodvessels terminate are extended
over all the closed elementary parts of the gland and supply them
with blood. In the chick we may observe the simultaneous
development of the two systems ; in proportion as the develop-
ment of internal surface from a plain membrane to caecnm and
ramified caeca proceeds, the vascular layer of I he originally simple
membrane is raised on the exterior of the efflorescence.
9. The ramified canals and tubes, which when the strncture is
simple, as in insects and Crustacea, and even in some glands of
the mammalia, lie free and unconnected, become more aggrega-
ted together, and acquire a common covering, in proportion as
their evolution is carried further; and thus is produced a paren-
chyma or solid organ.
10. The capillary blood-vessels are for the most part much
more minute than the smallest branches of the ducts of secreting
canals and their ca;cal extremities, even in the most complex
glandular organs. The elementary parts of glands though

minute, are of such a size that the capillary blood-vessels lorm
around them a network which invests them.
11. The formation of the glands in the emhryo displays the
same progressive evolution from the simple to the complex slate
as is observed in ascending the animal scale. The most perfect
and complex glands of the higher animals, when they first appear
tn the embryo of these animals consist merely of the free efferent
ducts without any branches, and in that state exactly resemble
the secreting organs of ihe lower animals. The glands are
formed from the unbranched tubes by a kind of efflorescence or
ramification.
12. The mode in which the extent of internal secreting surface
of a gland is realised is very various ; and no one kind of con-
formation is peculiar to any kind-of gland. Perfectly different
glands may have a similar elementary structure, a- is the case, for
instance, with the testes and the cortical sub-tance of the kidneys.
And similar glands have often a perfectly different structure in
different animals; of which the lachrymal glands, examined in
the chelonia, bird-, and mammalia, afford an example.

the character of a secretion cannot be deduced from the s'ructnre

light upon the mystery which had baffled his predecessors and to
explain the cause of the specific endowments of the different
glandular organs? Let us allow Midler to speak :

"The peculiarity of secretions does not depend on the internal
conformation of the glands; for, as I have sufficiently demon-
strated, each secretion is in different animals the product of the
most various glandular structures, and very different fluids are
secreted by glands of similar organisation. The nature of the
secretion depends therefore solely on the peculiar vital properties
of the organic substance which forms the secreting canals, and
which may remain the same, however different the conformation
of the secreting cavities may be; while it may vary extremely
although the form of the canal or ducts remain the same." It
was the living lining substance of the gland which, according to
Johannes Miiller, formed the secretion, at the expense of mate-
rials which it obtained from the blood of contiguous capillaries.
Thi- living sulwtance lining the inner recesses of the glands had
not yet been differentiated into its constituent units, the secreting
cells, and therefore Midler's statement wanted a certain definite-
ness, though, so far as he went, he was perfectly accurate.

instilling into the minds of the best of his pupils that love of
original inquiry, and that deep regard for truth which are the
chief incentives to all scientific research of any real value.
The investigations and Theories ok Bowman.
At the time when Goodsir was engaged in his investigations
and speculations relating to cells, Mr. Bowman was making
researches which were to give him a lasting place among the
great histologists of the century.
His investigations on the structure of the kidney,1 which was
published in the " Philosophical Transactions" for the year 1842,
surpassed in completeness as an anatomical study, no less than
by the deep insight into the nature of the function discharged by
the organ, any investigation of like kind which had preceded it.
Itjnot only led to a more complete knowledge of the structure of
the kidney than was possessed of that of any other gland, but to
far-seeing generalisations concerning the structure of mucous
membranes, and of secreting organs generally, which found ex-
pression in a masterly article on mucous membranes, published

in the year 1847, in the "Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and
Physiology."
Tine will not permit of my giving a complete analysis of the
(to use a German expression) epoch-making research upon the
kidney; but let me remind you that it led to a complete under-
standing of the relations of the Malpighian bodies to the urinary
tubules; to a description which, so far as it went, was perfectly
accurate of the tubules themselves, though the scheme upon
which these tubes are arranged has, since Bowman's time, thanks
to the labours of Henle, Ludwig, and Schweigger-Seidel, been
proved to be more complicated than he had imagined, and to a
knowledge of the distribution of blood-vessels, not only in the
kidney of man and other mammalia, but also in that of certain
reptiles.
His study of the structure of the tubuli uriniferi had led Mr.
Bowman to discover that in these, a layer of epithelial cells lies
upon a structureless membrane, to which he gave the name of
the basemint membrane? and which intervenes between the
epithelium and the blood capillaries, whence the materials of
secretion are primarily derived. His examination of the mucous
membranes of the body led Bowman to the conclusion that the
relationship so easily observed in the case of the kidney between
cells, basement membrane, and blood-vessels, is one which holds
true, not only in the case of that organ but in that of many other
epitheliated structures.

"In the mucous tissue," said Mr. Bowman (Article, Mucous
membrane, in Todd's "Cyclopaedia," p. 436), "there are two
structures which require to be separately described, viz., the
basement membrane and the epithelium. The basement membrane
is a simple homogenous expansion, transparent, colourless, and
of extreme tenuity, situated on its parenchymal surface and
giving it shape and strength. This serves as a foundation on
which the epithelium rests. The epithelium is a pavement com-
posed of nucleated particles adhering together, and of various
size, form, and number. The following general observations on
these elementary parts will receive illustration as we advance.
Neither the one nor the other is peculiar to the mucous tissue in
the sense either of being invariably present in it, or of not being
found elsewhere. There are certain situations of the mucous system where no basement membrane can be detected, and others
from which the epithelium is absent. Both, however, are never
absent together. Again, a structure apparently identical with
the basement membrane is met with in numerous textures besides
the mucous, and all internal cavities, whether serous, synovial,
or vascular, or of anomalous kind (as those of the thymus and
thyroid body), are lined by an epithelium."

tion shocks the nerve twigs proceeding from the lingual branch
of the fifth nerve, and which accompany Wharton's duct to the
gland, secretion of ssliva occurred, so long as the excitability of
the nerves persisted.
In experiments performed in conjunction with his pupil Rahn,
Ludwig found that secretion occurs on direct stimulation of the
glandular nerves, even when the circulation has been arrested
for a time, as for instance, when the contractions of the heart
are exhibited for some time.
2. Ludwig's Discovery that Secretion is not a Process directly
dependent upon the Arterial Pressure.In the paper which I
have already quoted, Ludwig published the results of the
following experiments. A mercurial gauge was placed in com-
munication with the duct of the subm ixillary gland, the height
ol the mercury in the guage being recorded (by means of a
float to which was attached a writing point) upon the travelling
surface of the kymigraphion, the instrument which Ludwig had
contrived for permanently recording the amount and variations
of the blood pressure in arteries and veins. At the same time,
another gauge placed in communication with the carotid artery,
or one of its branches in close proximity to the gland, recorded

the height of the blood pressure on the same travelling surface.
On stimulating the secretory nerves, Ludwig found that saliva
was poured out long after the pressure exerted by it upon the
interior of the gland (as measured by the height to which the
mercury was raised in the gland-duct manometer) exceeded the
pressure of blood in the arteries. Thus in his first recorded
experiment the mean pressure of blood in the carotid artery
amounted to 1085 millimetres of mercury, whilst during a
stimulation of the nerve filaments going to the gland, the
pressure in the gland-duct manometer rose to between 1907 and
io6-5 millimetre-, i.e., indicated that the pressure exerted by
the fluid, secreted under the influence of nerve stimulation,
exceeded the arterial pressure by an amount corresponding to
a column of mercury about 34 inches high. It is obvious that
the experiment at once and conclusively proved that the secre-
tion of a watery liquid like the saliva may be brought about by
a process altogether different from a process of filtration ; for in
filtration the passage of liquid through the minute pores of the
filter necessarily depends upon a difference in pressure on the
two sides of the filter, the movement of liquid being from the
side of greater to that of lesser pressure.
In this brief sketch I have only time to refer to the most
salient of the early discoveries of Ludwig on secretion, and
must pass over without comment the first experiments by which
he showed the influence exerted by variations in the strength

of the stimulus of secretory nerve upon the amount and chemical
composition of the secreted liquid.
3. Ludwig's Discovery that during Secretion Heat is evolved
in Glands.Pursuing his researches on the salivary glands,
Ludwig. some years later, (Ludwig u. Spiess, "Sitzungsber. d.
Wiener Akad. Mathem. u. Naturwissenchaft: Classe," vol.
xxv. (1857), p. 548,) in conjunction with his pupil Spiessi dis-
covered that, when a gland is thrown into action by stimulation
of its nerves, heat is evolved. In the case of the submaxillary
gland, for instance, he found that the saliva which was secreted
might have a temperature nearly three degrees Fahr. (l"5' C.)
above that of the blood going to the gland. Important as was
this result because of the light which it threw upon the source
of animal heat, its value as bearing upon the nature of the pro-
cess of secretion was even greater. From the fact that the
saliva is a liquid containing but three or four or five parts of
solid matters to one thousand of water, it would scarcely have
been surmised, upon a merely physical hypothesis, that its pro-
duction would have been attended by any considerable evolution
of heat. The evolution of heat is indeed one of the strongest
proofs we have that the act of secretion is the result of the

and these units may discharge their function so long as they con-
tinue to live and are supplied with the nutrimentmineral,
organic, and gaseous, which they require.
Leaving aside, at least for the present, any reference to the
arguments which may be derived, by analogy, from a study of
cell life in general, I would call your attention to the physio-
logical facts which prove the truth of the proposition ju-t enun-
ciated. The first of these facts was discovered by Claude
Bernard; to wit, that when all the nerves supplying the salivary
glands are divided, there is at first a temporary cessation of
secretion, soon followed, however, by an abundant flow of very
wa'ery, so-called paralytic saliva.
This result is fully confirmed by similar observations made in
the case of other secreting organs, and which establish very fully
the greater or less independence of the secreting elements from
the control of the nervous system; though unquestionably, in
a normal state of the organism of higher animals, the nervous
system is continually intervening, both directly by its influence
on gland cells, and indirectly by the changes which it produces
in the circulation, so as to control the operations of gland cells,

What the exact relations of nerve fibres to gland cells may be
is yet a matter involved in great doubt. The discovery made by
Plltiger of the terminations of nerve fibres in the secreting cells
of the salivary glands has not been confirmed by any observers
in any vertebrate. Kupffer has, however, unquestionably done
so in the case of Blatla orientalis, and although as yet objective
proof is wanting, we cannot entertain any reasonable doubts
that a connection between the ultimate fibrilla> of nerves and
secreting cells actually exists. We feel confident that physical,
as it were accidental, difficulties have alone hindered the precise
determination of the fact.
The Immediate Source of the Nutriment consumed
by the Gland Cell.
In the original scheme of a secreting gland, developed first of
all by Bowman, then adopted byGoodsir, Carpenter,1 and many
other writers, the essential structural elements taken into ace >unt
were the following:1. Epithelial cells lining the secreting
cavity of the gland; 2. Subepithelial tissue, usually presenting
superficially the form of a basement membrane, upon which the
cells were placed; and 3. A capillary network in closer relation
to the basement membrane, or more superficial part of the sub-
epithelial tissue. In harmony with this scheme, the glandular elements were always spoken of as drawing their supply from
the blood in the capillaries. The one element which was wanting
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
in that scheme, and which we are able to fit into it, thanks again
to the labours of the great physiologist of Leipzig, is the relation
of so-called lymph spaces to the other elements. As was first
shown by the researches of Ludwig and his school, amongst the
modes of origin of the peripheral lymphatics, the most numerous
are to be found in connective tissue, and nowhere more abun-
dantly than in the connective tissue of glands, which is
everywhere interpenetrated by irregular spaces containing
lymph, from whence spring the minutest lymphatics. If we
consider, then, the immediate environment of the secreting cell,
we find that in close proximity to it is the lymph, which is a
transudation from the blood, and upon which the gland cells are
directly dependent for all the matters which they require For
a certain time, then, the gland cell will be independent of the
supply of blood, that is, so long as the lymph surrounding it con-
tains a sufficient quantity of essential matters, of which oxygen is
0'ie of the chief, to support its life, or until it becomes so charged
with waste products derived from cell life, e.g. C05, as to inter-
fere with the functions of the latter. It certainly appears that,
at least in the majority of cases, it is the secreting cell which
modifies, in the first instance, the composition of the lymph

supposed to be separated by the so-called "glomeruli," whilst
the organic solids of the secreti n were supposed to be separated
by the epithelium lining ihe convoluted tubes.
To this theory was opposed that of Ludwig, according to
which the whole of the constituents, watery, saline, and organic,
were supposed to be poured out of the vessels of the glomerulus,
the amount of water however being far in excess of that contained
in the liquids when it reaches the pelvis of the kidney. Ludwig
supposed that as the secretion passed over the surface of the
epithelium lining tl e complex tubule-, proces-es of diffusion
occurred between it, on the one hand, and the lymph bathing
the tissues lying outside of the basement membrane of the tubules
on the other, the direction of the current of water being from
without inwards. The anatomical evidence adduced by Bowman
was of itself well-nigh efficient to prove the accuracy of his
views, which have however been placed beyond all dispute by
the following observations: Heindenhain introduced into the
blood a solution of sulphindigotate of sodium, u ua'ly some time
after having divided the spinal cord in the cervical region. On
killing the animal some time afterwards and ;ubjecting the
kiney to carelul examination, it was found that the colouring

matter had been accumulated by the epithelium of the convoluted
tubules from the lym;ih bathing the tissues, and which contained
ro little colouring matter as to appear colourle s. If a sufficient
time had elapsed after the injection, the colouring matter was
found in the form of granules or minute crystals ljing on the
inner side of the cell in the lumen of the tubules.
Bowman, as I have already mentioned, had in the case of the
boa constrictor studied in detail the blood supply to the organ,
which, as Jacobson had shown, differs in fishes, birds, and
reptiles, fiom the mode of arrangement prevailing in mammals.
Bowman had shown that in the boa the glomeruli derived
their blood exclusively from the renal artery, and the convoluted
tube exclu ively from the common iliac vein. Nussraum gave
absolute completeness to the proof of Bowman's theory by the
following remarkable experiment. Experimenting on the newt,
in which the Mood-supply of the kidney is similar to that of the
b >a, he found that, when he tied th: renal artery, he arrested
almost entirely the secretion of water in the kidney, but that the
excretion of urea and other solid matters, and amongst others of
the colour ng matter already used by Heidenhain, viz., indigo
carmine, continued. Ligature of the renal branches of the com-
mon iliac vein stopped the secretion of organic solids without
impeding that of water.
The most recent Theories advanced in Explanation of
the Phenomena ok Glandular Secretion.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Having brought before you the most salient facts with which
we are acquainted, which appear to throw the most light upon
the general physiology of glandular secretion, I wish, before
concluding, to speak of the theoretical views which have been
advanced in explanation of a large number of the facts.
In the first place, I have to confess that our ignorance is
absolute as to the cause of the specific endowment of different
secreting cells, in virtue of which they produce new bodies at
the expense of certain of the materials supplied to them by the
lymph, or separate particular constituents from the lymph, to the
¦exclu-ion of others which are equally abundant in the liquid.
We express the full measure of our ignorance when we state
i'iat the difference in function of different gland cells is due to
differences in endowment of the protoplasm of the cell, which in
no case is explained by any objective characters of the cell.
The phenomena of the secretion of water, which forms so
large a part of every secretion, have given rise, however, to
numerous speculations, concerning which I may make a few
remarks.
The primitive view that the glands are organs in which is
strained off from the blood water holding certain substances in

4I4
[August 24, 188
NATURE
Me that on the gland cell passing into the condition of activity
an increased production of COs may occur, leading to an
increased diffusion of water outwards.
So far, I have quoted Professor Hedenhain, for the most part in
his own words. Let me add, however, that the two hypotheses
which he advances as possible explanations of the mechanism of
secretion of water by the cell rest upon the most probable grounds,
as upon the presence of the intra-cellular protoplasmic network
which has been so beautifully demonstrated by recent researches,
and especially by those of Professor Klein; or, again, up in the
fact, proved by the analyses of Professor Ffliiger of the gases of
the saliva, that there is during secretion great production of CO£,
as shown by the amount of this gas in the saliva being much
greater than in the blood, and upon the fact of the remarkable
diffu ibiliiy of acid solutions.
Reasoning upon a large number of facts, which I have not
time to refer to, Profe-sor Heidenhain has come to the conclu-
sion that, quite apart from the nerves which control the vascular
rupply to a gland, there exist two distinct sets of nerve-fibres in
relation to the glandular elements. The first of these, which he
terms "secretory," when stimulated, lead to the secretion of
        Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:11 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
water and saline constituents; the second, which he terms
"trophic," influence the transformations of the protoplasm of
the cell, and thus affect the organc constituents of the secretion.
I do not «i?h to pronounce a definite opinion concerning this
hypothesis, but would remark that the nomenclature proposed by
Heidenhain appears to me to be an unfortunate one, especially
because it attaches a new meaning to a word which had pre-
viously been used by physiologists in a different sense. I refer to
the adjective trophic, which has always implied "governing
nutrition." It appears to me almost inconceivable that if there
exist two sets of secretory nerves, the action of each should not
profoundly affect the nutrition of the cell protoplasm, though,
of course, it is conceivable that they should do so in very
different manners.
General Conclusions.
The complicated studies, of which 1 have attempted to give
you a brief sketch, have led to our forming certain clear general
conceptions in reference to the process of secretion. They have
brought into greater prominence the dignity, if I may use the
expression, of the individual cell. The process of secretion
appears as the result of the combined work of a large number of
these units. Each, after the manner of an independent or-
ganism, uses oxygen, forms COs, evolves heat, and derives its
nutriment from the medium in which it lives, and performs
chemical operations of which the results only are imperfectly

known to us, and which depend upon peculiar endowments of
the cell protoplasm, of which the causes are hidden from
us. So long as the protoplasm is living, the gland cell
retains its power of discharging its functions, and in many
cases does so, so long as the intercellular liquid furnishes it with
the materials required. In some case-i, how ever, the gland cells
are specially sensitive to a variation in the composition of the
nutrient liquid, certain constituents of which appear to stimulate
the protoplasm to increased activity. In the higher animals the
cells, particularly in certain glands, are in relation to nerves
which, when stimulated, affect in a remarkable manner the
transformations of their protoplasm, leading to an increased con-
sumption of oxygen, an increased production of carbonic acid, an
increased evolution of heat, and an increased production of those
matters which the cell eliminates and which constitute its
secretion.
This historical survey of the growth of our knowledge of the
process of secretion exhibits the characteristic features of
biological advancement. Comparative anatomy has been the
foundation of observation of facts and phyical experiment, the
road to physiological research. At various stages the value of

On Monday night there was atHmportant installation of the
Edison electric light in the "Pros Department" of the Tele-
graph Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and the work thus carried
out solves what have hitherto been considered some difficult
problems in the question of electric lighting. The first Interest-
ing fact is that the lighting is part of a "system" supplied at a
distance from the place lighted, the Edison Electric Light
Company having its centre on Holborn Viaduct. The exten-
sion to the top room of the General Post Office, which was
accomplished last night, is the greatest yet made from one centre,
the distance from the dynamo-room of the company's office to
the "Press Room" of the General Post Office being 1950 feet.
The " Press Koom" to which the Edison electric light has thus
been supplied is a very busy part of the telegraph department
(1200 persons being employed there), which occupies the whole

upper floor of the western building in St. Martin's-le-Grand.
The Post Office authorities have long been alive to the necessity
of replacing gas by electricity, and have tried more than one
so-called "system." Under the advice of Mr. Preece, the
electrical engineer of the Post Office, the Edison system was
attached, and last night commenced its working. The first
lighting was soon after 8 o'clock, and when the gas in the Press
Room was extinguished, a turn of the switch lighted up fifty-
nine incandescent lamps of the well-known pear-shaped pattern,
with the carbon of the shape of an elongated borse-shoe. The
effect of the change was very marked. In the telegraph room
the atmosphere was heavy and heated. In the room lighted by
the Edison lamps an ,even light without any shadow was thrown
all over the tables, while the atmosphere, previously heated by
gas, sensibly diminished, even in the short space of about twenty
minutes.

The Report of the Chief Inspector of Mines (Mr. Couchman)

1881 is both an interesting and instructive document. It appears
that there were altogether 38,436 miners employed in the colony,
and, of these, part were engaged in alluvial mining, and part in
quartz mining. The total number of accidents was 157, by
which 72 men were killed and 108 injured. Forty of the deaths
and 43 of the cases of injury were caused by falls of earth or rock
at the surface and underground. More than 50 per cent, of the
whole were thus due to a class of accidents which claim a similar
proportion of the victims in our mines at home. The remaining
accidents arcse from : falling down shafts, winzes, and shoots;
falls of material down shafts; cage accidents; machinery in
motion; explosion of lithofracteur, gunpowder, dynamite, &c. 
and miscellaneous causes. After describing the nature of the

that the appearance of the later work furnishes an oppor-
tunity for some reference to the former.
We have referred to the two volumes as unequal in
importance-seeing that one offers itself as a guide to the
whole of botanical literature, while the other only occupies
a small portion of the same wide field. But the inference
that "Vegetable Technology" was merely a portion of
the larger work would be very incorrect; the two volumes
are quite distinct, and are treated in a different manner,
and neither covers the ground occupied by the other. The
arrangement of the two books is also different. The "Guide"
is a list of books classified under headings expressing dif-
ferent branches of the subject, the index consisting of the
authors' names, with reference to the titles (abbreviated)
of their works By the time Mr. Jackson had completed
the " Guide," he was fully conscious of the inconveniences
of this plan; and formed a resolution that, if again
engaged in any similar labour, he "would steadily adhere
to the practice of ranging the works under an alpha-
betical sequence of authors' names"; this resolution
he has carried out in " Vegetable Technology." There
can, we think, be little doubt as to the advantage of this
latter plan. It is by no means easy to classify some
works; and Mr. Jackson's grouping in his earlier volume,

know what to expect under such headings as " Maturiza-

Phenomena" (p. 107). A reader searching for references
to works on the bamboos would find one such treatise
under Bambusa; but he would hardly think of searching
further under the heading "Textile Plants," where,
nevertheless, is a second book on the subject, "Bamboo
and its Uses," by S. Kurz. A cross reference here, as in
many other cases, is almost essential; on the system
adopted in " Vegetable Technology," a help of this kind
is supplied by the index of subjects. The island of St.

Of course these are omissions we do not find in Mr. Kurz's
book on the Bamboo, mentioned above ; the volume on
the "Eatable Funguses of Great Britain," illustrated by
Mr. W. G. Smith, is not referred to, although Mr. Bad-

the oher hand such books as Loudon's " Hortus Britan-

which reference has already been made, is all that an
index should be, and fully justifies Mr. Jack-on's belief
that "these entries supply a very fair starting-point for
almost every question in vegetable technology."
Space will not allow us to enter further upon the merits
of these Guides. Enough has, however, been said to
direct attention to their importance and practical utility,
and to encourage the happiest auguries for the success of
the magnum opus upon which Mr. Jackson is at present

OUR BOOK SHELF
Talks about Science. By the late Thomas Dunman.
(London : Griffith and Farran.)
Under an unpretending title are here collected a number
of lectures that were delivered to popular audiences,
chiefly in and about London, by one whose decease,
recently, in the early prime of life, has been much de-
plored. At the time of his death, Mr. Dunman held a
post of tuition in Physiology and Animal Morphology in
the Birkbeck Institution, and his labours there and else-
where were attended with growing popularity and suc-
cess. The biographical sketch by his friend, Mr. Charles
Welsh, with which the book opens, tells of the zeal and
well-directed energy with which he applied himself to
overcoming the obstacles that for some time barred his
path to what he considered his true life-work, viz. the
teaching of science. These lecturesthirteen in num-
ber, deal with a considerable variety of topics, the me-
chanism of sensation, the star-lit sky, prehistoric man,
volcanoes and coral reefs, atoms and molecules, and so
on. The style is terse and lucid, and appears to have
been carefully formed on the best models. The happy
gift of relieving the strain of which many minds are
conscious under mere scientific exposition, by some
Eassing allusion to a familiar human experience, by the

omely figure, the apt quotation, the play of imagination
and humour, Mr. Dunman seems to have possessed in
rich measure.
The lectures entitled "Two Life Histories" and "How
the Earth is Weighed and Measured," may be taken as
good examples of abstruse matters expounded without
technical language, and made clear for a working-class
audience. Mr. Dunman's going down a coal-pit in order
to qualify himself more thoroughly for his lecture on
"Coal," is typical of much of his work, which in this
respect (the " testifying that which he had seen'^mani-
fested, no doubt, the inspiration of his admired teacher,
Huxley. Exception might be taken to a few passages in
the lectures, e %. to the account of ocean temperatures, in
"Depths of Ocean" which seems inadequate; and occa-
sionally the author seems to affirm more confidently than
the facts warrant. But as a whole the book is a good
specimen of sound popularised science, and eminently
engaging. As a present to a young artizan with a
nascent love of science, it could not fail to be much
appreciated.

The Gesture Speech of Man
The valuable paper of Col. Mallery (Nature, vol. xxvi. p.
333) is deserving of much attention, l.ut his decription cf the
relations of gesture-language and speech-language is calculated
to cause misconceptions, on account of the view he has taken of
the origin and propaga'ion of speech. Admitting the general
accuracy of his description of the ges ure-language or dialects of
man, then that descripti n is really applicable to speech.
Setting aside all theories and looking at facts, all spoken
languages have psychological relations, as gesture-languages
have, and in their early stages are founded on the same prin-
ciples of having several repre-entations for one idea, and several
ideas for one representative 'sign. With regard to sounds
applied as representative signs, as a general law these are the
same for all languages, and the diversity observable arises from
the diversity of selection and distribution.
It can be setn by the commonest observer that among the
remotest languages there are like words, but as it is assumed

and disregarded. On the other hand, many are led astray by such
identities to set up relationships and to form schemes of classi-
fication between languages, which are not justly admissible.
Nothing has been more ridiculed than the identities of words
set forth between Quichua, for instance, and various languages
of the old world, and yet nothing can be more ju*t than the
identities, which speak for themselves to the unprejudiced.
A great argument against the relationship of languages has, on
the other hand, been derived from the diversities which are
equally apparent as the identities among such languages, and the
supposed negative evidence derived is used as conclusive against
any relationship.
The phenomena are very complicated, as are the phenomena
of gesture-language, but the solution is to be found in those
remarks of Mr. A. R. Wallace, of which I have given the
application as the Wallace formula (Nature, vol. xxiv. pp. 244,
380). I repeat this, becau-e further observations and a long
course of investigation leave no doubt as to the facts and their
application.
Proceeding on the basis of a system of sign-languages generally
existing in the world, we obtain the explanation of the engrafting
of sounds in defined series. Mr. Wallace's labial for mouth,
nasal for nose, and dental for tooth, provides labials for every
idea based on the round form of mouth, or on its opening and

closing, as head, face, eye, ear, sun, moon, egg, &c. Thee,
again, were in relation with defined mj thological and numeral
characteristic--, affoiding abstractions.
Thus, a whole apparatus of speech was provided, but it was
complicated first by the condition, imparted from gesture
language of plurality of signs, and next by the faculty of apply-
ing various labials, &c. What Col. Mallery states to have taken
place in ge-ture language is precisely that which took place in
speech language. In the process of selection, the apparatus of
each class was ultimately diminished so far as the common stock
was concerned, and each language acquiring only a por ion of
the common tock, has at present the appearance of a separate
and indiscriminate vocabulary in relation with all, but not
identical with any except its own immediate congeners.
Thus the effective comparative philology of any language
ultimately defends on its relationship to all, and not to one
family.
As all speech languages are of common origin, so we must admit a common diffusion of them over the world. The result is
seen in the relationships of the languages of America with those
of Africa, for instance, but it is attested by a community of
verbal forms in traditions and in mythylogy, and even in geo-

WILLIAM STANLEY JEVOSS
\fy~ILLIAM STANLEY JEVONS, whose tragical
death was recorded in our issue of the 17th inst.,
j>. 377 )¦> was bom at Liverpool in 1835. As in the case
of most men of intellectual work, the facts of his life are
few and simple. He was educated partly in Liverpool,
partly at University College, London, where he particu-
lariy distinguished himself in the classes of mathematics
and natural science. For University College Jevons ever
retained feelings of the warmest loyalty. He was proud
of his connection with it and with the London University,
and doubtless these feelings weighed with him when in
1876 he resigned his chair at the Owens College and
accepted that of Political Economy at University College.
Before completing his career as a student, Jevons accepted
an appointment in the Sydney Mint and spent five years
(1S54-59J in practical work abroad. At the close of that
time his disinterested determination to devote his life and
energies to intellectual work of the highest kind prompted
him to return to England and to resume his interrupted
studies. He graduated at London in 1862 with the

highest distinction in logic and political economy, and a
year later began his active career as a teacher in the
capacity of general teacher at the Owens College, a post
he occupied for three years. Even at this early period cf
his life, however, he had already produced not only an
earnest of his great powers but the germs of all the best
work he afterwards accomplished. A pamphlet on the
Fall in the I a.'ue of Gold, and an important work on the
probability and consequences of the exhaustion of coal
sufficiently attested his mastery over concrete problems of
economics. But of even greater significance was the
short paper presented in 1862 to the British Association
on quantitative reasoning in economical theory and the
little noticed volume on Pitre I o£ic ''1864). The one
contains the fundamental notions of the author's later
work in theoretical political economy, the other the first
principles and outlines of the development of his well-
known symbolical logic. In 1866 Jevons was appointed
to the combined chair of Philosophy and Political
Economy at the Owens College, and for ten years he
discharged with the greatest ability and success the
onerous duties of the office. During this time his practical
activity was incessant and his intellectual labour con-
tinuous. In political economy his occasional contribu-
tions in the shape of papers in the Statistical Society's

Theory of Political Economy (1871), and his excellent
manual on ]rgic. his tract Money; or, The Substitvticn 0/
Similars, his Elementary Lessons on Logic, and his great
work, the Principles of Science  1S74, raised his reputa-
tion to the highest point, and it may be confidently said
that no man ever obtained or deserved so thoroughly to
obtain more widespread recognition as a master in these
departments of knowledge. In 1876 the feeling that his
time might with greater advantage to himself and the
public be devoted to continuing his original researches,
prompted his resignation of the laborious chair at Owens
College. In that year he migrated to London and to
University College, and for five \ears he continued to hold
the chair of Political Economy in that institution. The
same desire for more time induced him in 1881 to resign
the comparatively light duties of his London chair, and
he was doubtless enjoying the feeling of perfect freedom
to devote himself to his beloved work when the abhorred
shears cut short the thin spun thread of his life. A great
force for good and a noble type of the man of science has

exhaustiveness such as amply to establish his title to
them. No man, it may be added, was ever more anxious
than Jevons to do justice to the labours of his prede-
cessors, and he was ever ready to welcome in the most
generous fashion any indication of an anticipation of
some favourite thought. His work was good enough,
and he knew it was good enough, to stand upon its
own merits.
In logic the system of formal or mechanical reference
which Jevons worked out in great detail, was founded
upon the antecedent researches of Boole. The processes,
however, were presented by Jevons in such a fashion, the
principles were so simplified and the capabilities of the
method so ingeniously developed that his work has a
secure place of its own alongside that of Boole. This is
not the place for discussing the permanent worth of the
new analysis of inference, but it may be said that hardly
sufficient justice has yet been done to many of the specu-
lations into which Jevons was naturally led in the
development of his analysis. His treatment of the rela-
tions of logical and numerical quantity, and his attempt

to deal with induction apart from all quasi metaphysical
principles are bold and subtle contributions to logical
theory and, in connection with his other work in this
department they sufficiently establish his place as an
original and thoughtful logician.
For philosophical speculation, in the wider sense, Jevons
had little inclination, and possibly from the character of
his intellect, little ability. Dealing with ultimate logical
and economical questions he was often driven to the verge
of inquiries such as fall under the designation of philoso-
phy, to problems of the theory of knowledge and ofethics,
but he never crossed the boundary, and indeed seemed
somewhat impatient of the existence of a land beyond
the formal relations of logical terms or the quantitative
variations of pleasure and pain. This lack of interest in
problems going to the root of logical and economical
theory makes itself apparent in almost all his works, and
probably, for many reasons, deprives them of some of
their value. It is impossible to say, however, what
genuine contribution to English philosophising might not
heve been made had so original and well endowed a mind
been spared longer to us.

essential work of the Association is concerned, it has
been up to a fair average. The New Forest excursion
was an especially enjoyable one, though that to the Isle
of Wight was most interesting from a scientific point
of view.
During the meeting the reception rooms and the rooms
in which the Sections have met have been connected by
telephones. In each room was a board on which were
painted in a line the letters indicating the Sections
Below each letter there was space for a figure to be in-
serted to indicate the number of the paper in the day's
programme that was under discussion; if it were No. 3
in Geology, the attendant there sent the number to the
reception room. Here the attendant marked the board,
and then sent the information to all the other Sections,
so that it could be known in all the rooms what was the
subject under discussion in each Section.
There was a sharp discussion on the question whether
the Association should meet in Canada next year, seeing
that Oxford has withdrawn its invitation, but the meeting
decided on Southport, with Prof. Cay ley as President.

Opening Address by Robert Etheridge, F.R.S., F.G.S.,
President ok the Section.
For some years it has been the rule or practice that the
Presidents should open the sectional meetings with an address,
selecting any subject which may seem to them best adapted to
the occasion. This custom I believe had its origin in this
Section, when the Association met at Aberdeen, and was due to
Sir C. Lyell, who was the first to deliver an opening address.
He selected for his theme the discoveries of M. Boucher de
Perthes, chiefly with relation to the occurrence and association of
flint weapons with the bones of extinct animals in the gravels of
the valley of the Somme.

ing I have the honour to preside, embraces a wide field of
research, and therefore allows selection from a large range of
subjects, so large indeed that it would be difficult to choose an
original one that would be acceptable and useful to those mem-
bers of the Association who may be present. It is thirty-six
years since the British Association last met in Southampton, and
probably not half-a dozen members who attended the meeting of
1846 are now present, if living. We are, however, fortunate in
having with us today one or two who contributed rapers to this
Section thirty-six years ago.
The Geological Section may be congratulated on its place of
meeting this year. Hampshire presents a wide range and field
of research to the practical, as well as the less advanced student
in geology. Truly may it be said that this area is classic ground.
No less than six distinct formations, with their subdivision?, occur
in the immediate neighbourhood and within reach of those mem-
bers who have honoured the Association with their presence this
year. Be it remembered that it is thirty-six years since the
British Association met in this city. Since then, or the year
1846, geology has indeed advanced with strides unsurpassed by
any other science. The Tertiary rocks of the Hampshiie basin
alone have received from the hands of private and learned
physicists, as will as the long-continued labour of the Geological
Survey, the most careful and detailed research. It may well be
said that this rich field has not wanted competent labourers,

earliest and foremost of whom must be named Webster, Sedg-

mapped out with so much care and accuracy the intricate struc-
ture of the Isle of Wight. To these must be added, through
later research, the names of Searles Wotd, Wright, Fisher,
Tawney, Keeping, Judd, and others. Other portions of
Hampshire and Sussex bearing upon the question of the Anglo-
French Tertiary basin, have beer, elab >rately treated upon by
Dixon, Godwin-Austen, Sir C. Lyell, and others.
It may be a fitting preliminary to local communication which
will most probably come in, during the course of this meeting,
that I should summarise what has been done in this area. This
may be familiar to many, but there are others who may wish to
examine certain geological localities, the mention of which may
induce them to visit spots of much interest. It is scarcely the
duty of the president of this Section to devote the time allowed
to an opening address to the discussion of any original subject,
while work of unusual local interest has transpired during the
past year to justify him in drawing attention to a subject of much
importance connected with the stratigraphical position of certain
beds in the Eocene strata of the Lie of Wight ; a question of

the sea. This encroachment and destruction during the past 800
years has been very extensive.
The creek called Pagham Harbour, on the south-east side of
the Bill or peninsula, was due to an irruption before the year
1345, when 2,700 acres of land were de-troyed. The site of the
ancient cathedral and episcopal palace of Selsea, believed to have
been situated to the south-east of the present ehurch of Pagham,
is no longer to be determined, but there is no reason to doubt
but that it stood nearly a mile out in what is now sea. Camden,
in his "Britannia," states that "in this isle remaineth only the
dead carcase as it were, of that ancient little citie (where those
bishops (of Selsea) had their seat), hidden quite with water at
every tide, but at low water evident and plain to be seen."
The Bishop's Park, as the shore and sands are still called,
extended for many acres on the south-east coast, and the remain-
ing fragment has still the name of Park Coppice. The sea has
gained more than a mile on this coast since the see and cathedral
of Selsea was established, a.d. 680 ; Wilfred was the first Bishop
of Selsea in that year, and Stigand was the first Bishop of
Chichester, A.D. 1070. No less than twenty-two Bishops had
occupied the episcopal chair of Selsea, and resided there, before

the removal to Chichester. The parish that divides Selsea from
Bognor is called Pagham, and the extensive estuary, which is a
mile long and broad in places, Pagham Harbour. The remark-
able church is dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, and the ruins
of the archiepiscopal palace are still visible south-east of the
chmvh. Archbishop Becket resided here with a large retinue,
and his interference with a manor within his lordship, gave rise
to his dissension with Henry II. which terminated in his assas-
sination. That part of the coast marked "the Park," now
covered by the sea, was part of the prelate's extensive estate,
and is still visible at low water. The houses of the village are
built of an arenaceous limestone almost entirely made up of
microscopical shells, of the genera Miliola and Alveolina. This
stone was formerly procured abundantly from an extensive range
or ledge of rocks (calls the Clibs and Mixen) south of Selsea
Bill, and extending some distance east and west. In 1830 the
removal of this bed of stone was forbidden, forming as it did
and doer, a barrier to the encroachment of the sea.
This digression and somewhat archaeological dissertation is
neces-ary for my purpose, when drawing your attention to those
recent geological changes that have taken place along that coa-t
almost within modern times.
Thorney, Ham, and Medmeney marches, behii d Bracklesham
Bay, and between Bracklesham and Selsea, are of marine or
estuarine origin, separating Selsea from the mainland, making it

what its name expresses, an isiand, "Seles-eu," or "Island of
the Sea-calf." We are thus led to believe that when Selsea
became known to Ihe Engliih nation it was an island, and that
in Bede's time the process of silting up the estuary must have
commenced, and the completion of this process would seem to
have been before the Conquest. The action of the tides on this
coast carries the s.md and shingle from west to east, therefore the
gradual wasting w hich has taken place on the shore of Brack-
lesham Bay has served to supply a large portion of the material
of which these marshes are formed.
The ground on which Selsea, Bognor, Littlehampton, Worthing, and other places on the Sussex coat westward of Brighton
are built, is of very recent formation, being composed of gravels,
sands, and loam belonging to the post-Pleiocene or Pleistocene
series. These superficial post-Pleiocene beds overlie the well-
known Eocene series in patches, and contain a large fauna. No
less than 66 genera and 142 species, chiefly mollusca, occur here.
The remains of the mammoth or elephant (E. primigenius, or
antiquui) occur in the muddy deposits [mud-deposit]. With
these are associated marine shells of existing species, but some
not known now as such on the Sussex coast. East of Bognor,

sentially southern and western, do not ran»e further north, or
into the German Ocean area, and this southern relation of the
fauna of the Lower Selsea deposit (Lulratia mud deposit) is still
further strikingly illustrated by the presence of the l>efore-men-
ti'ined two remarkable species, Fecten pjlymorphtis and Lulraria
-rugosa, neither of which are now known to range further north
than Lisbon. "We therefore have indications of a warmer condi-
tion of the waters of the English Channel, which allowed southern
forms to range to a more northern latitude than now, and then a
limitation of these forms to the area where now found, or in the
Sussex deposits." The inference drawn by Mr. Godwin-Austen
as to the manner in which the elephant's remains occur in this
Lulraria clay is an obvious and an interesting one, as it enables
us to arrive at a relative geological date, showing that the lower
estuarine beds of Selsea and of the Sussex levels generally were
contemporary with what is known as the period of the large
mammalian fauna.
Overlying this Lutraria or mud deposit, there occurs a tough,
ca'cireous, sandy clay; with chalk, and chalk flintswaterworn
and of large size. This Yellow Drift clay is of marine origin,
determined by the associated mollusca; Littorina and Mytilus

being disseminated through the mass. This deposit occurs over
the whole of the Selsea peninsula, and extends inland beneath
the Sussex levels. Besides the large masses of flints and ma-
terials from the chalk, oolitic rocks, and chert-sandstone from
the Upper Greensand, resembling that occurring at Lym-and
Charmouth, there are other rocks which, from their "ages, com-
position, origin, size, and condition," render the mode of accu-
mulation a problem of great geological interest. "The rocks
in question consist of grey porphyritic granites, red syenites,
syenite, hornhlendic greenstones, michaschists, green fissile
slates, masses of quartz from veins, siliceous sandstones," such as
occur in the Palaeozoic series (Lower Silurian) of Normandy,
micaceous sandstone with orthides, probably from the Devonian
beds, and blocks of compact limestone, whether from the
Devonian series of Devon or the Cotentin (France), is
uncertain."
In size these older rocks range from coarse shingle up to masses
of 20 tons weight, the granitic rocks being the most numerous
and of the largest dimensions. A mass of porphyritic rock was
exposed near Pagham by coast-line denudation, mea-uring 27
feet in circumference. Whence came they, and how brought,
or what the transporting agent beyond that of floating ice, we
know not. I must refer you to Mr. R. Godwin-Austen's original
paper for matter of the highest interest relative to the original
history of the yellow clay aud the conglomerate bed, and later

deposits in Sussex, as well as other phenomena bearing upon the
present aspect of this singular areaa description of the
complex nature of the structure of which would here be out of place. "What was the condition of the English channel as to
its coast-line when certain marginal accumulations were being
formed?" To answer this demands a profound acquaintance
with the old physical geography of the district both of Northern
France and Southern England.
The Brick-earth.Above the yellow clay and mammalian
gravels, the highest or uppermost deposit on the coast, there
occurs a uniform bed of dark chocolate coloured unstratified
clay, averaging about 3 feet in thickness. This clay forms part
of that great layer of earthy matter which overlies all the gravel
and other beds of the Sussex levels, and is extensively used for
hrickmaking. This brick-earth is a subaerial deposit, probably
occurring as the wash of a terrestrial surface under a greater
rainfall than we have now. This dep isit is conspicuously
shown along the shore, and forms the low cliffs of Brackle-
sham Bay. To this period Mr. Godwin-Austen refers the
"Combe rock" of Selsea. He then refers to the condition
of the English Channel area, at the period of the Crag-
deposits of the German Ocean. The author is disposed

writers upon the succession of the beds and their correlation
with other localities. Mr. Gardner's researches endeavour to
show that the celebrated Bournemouth leaf-beds immediately
underlie the true Bracklesham series, and are, unlike those of
Alum Bay, of Middle and not of Ltnver Bagshot period, hitherto
the received view as to their age. The author has also ascer-
tained that a great portion of the cliffs between Hengistbury
Head and Bournemouth are of marine origin, and highly fos-
siliferous. These marine beds comprise two distinct characters,
which the author traces across to Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight.
Mr. Gardner also differs from the Geological Survey in believing
"that the so-called Upper Bagshot beds of the London ba-in
do not belong to that series, but are the equivalents of his
Boscombe sands, these sands, and the marine Bournemouth beds
being, according to his researches, the western equivalents, or
extreme shore condition of the Bracklesham sea."
At Highcliff, nearly under Rothsay Castle, both the Barton
and the Bracklesham series are exposed, the Barton being not
more than 10 feet in thickness, and the subjacent Bracklesham40
feet. The section is revealed to the sea-level, and therefore
highly instructive. The Highcliff sands conformably underlie
the Barton and Hordwell series at an angle of 2° to the E. The
remarkable promontory of Hengistbury Head is mainly composed
of strata contemporaneous with the Bracklesham series; and
which Mr. Gardner would for convenience call the Bournemouth

beds. Hengistbury promontory in shape resembles a parallelo-
gram obliquely truncated at its northern extremity. The cliffs
facing the sea on the south are about 50 feet high, increasing to
100 feet on the north, both presenting bold escarpments to the
sea. "The succession of the strata at Hengistbury Head, read-
ing upwards, comprises, I, the Boscombe sands; 2, a lower
series of sand with green grains, and an upper bed with iron-
stone; and 3, the white Highcliff sand. The white sands at
Highcliff are 30 feet thick, being 12 feet thinner than the equiva-
lent beds at Alum Bay, where they measure about 42 feet." The
lowest series in the cliffs at the headland Mr. Gardner terms the
"Boscombe sands," which without any doubt represents the
chief mass of brilliantly coloured sands, about 750 feet thick, at
Alum Bay, known to all explorers of the island. These coloured
sands are numbered 25 and 26 in Professor Prestwich's section of
the vertical beds in Alum Bay (Vide Quarterly Journal of the
Geological Society, vol. ii.). Mr. Gardner also notices another
hill similar in contour to that of Hengistbury, about three miles
to the north of the Head. This, St. Catherine's Hill, possesses,
like the headland, similar physical features, being flat-topped
and having abrupt escarpments on all side--, and 160 feet high.

NA TURE
Mr. Gardner places these Bournemouth beds in the Middle
Bagshots, drawing the line between these and the Lower
Bagshots at the pipe-clay beds of Corfe, Studland, and Alum
Bay in the Isle of Wight. This line of division is drawn on
account of the great dissimilarity of the flora contained in each.
The Bournemouth flora, which is distinct from the older, or
Alum Bay series, passes up into the so-called Oligocene without
any perceptible change or break; but few, or none of the same
species pass down or occur with the Alum Bay beds.
These Middle Bagshots are represented in Alum Bay by the
unfossiliferous beds marked 19 to 24 in Professor Prest-
wich's section, (Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,
vol. x. p. 56,) and are 240 feet thick. Palieontologically,
these beds may be correlated with the continental Eocene, pro-
bably those of Aix-la-Cbapelle. The cliffs fronting the sea
may be divided into three groups. The first extends from
Poole Harbour to Bateman's Chine, the second group extends
from the Sugar-loaf Chine to Watering Chine, the third section
or group extends from Watering Chine to the Bourne Valley.'
The chief interest attached to the Bournemouth beds is the
flora distributed chiefly through the Lower or Freshwater Series.

None of the prevailing Alum Bay types are found at Bourne-
mouth, nor are any of the well known Bouremouth types found
at Alum Bay, and according to Mr. Gardner, their affinities are
completely with the floras ascribed in France to the Oligocene,
and the forms of flora as at present known, chiefly Australian
and tropical American.
The author has endeavoured to show that "a great river
existed throughout the whole of Eocene times, bringing deposits i
from the westward, and that the Bournemouth cliffs present a i
section across its bed, these deposits being formed during a con- j
tinued period of sub-idence." The sudden change observed in
the beds from fine to coarse sediment, and the thickness of the'
deposit, cannot be explained by the flood-; and fre-hets inci-
dental to changing season?, but are such as would occur whenever
subsidence exceeded, in however trifling a decree, the silting
up power of the river," loc. cit. p. 13.
It is a question of importance whether the continental floras
similar to our own at Bournemouth have been correctly deter-
mined. "For while all the strata that have yielded dicotyledo-
nous leaves or fruits below our Headen series are admitted to be
Eocene, scarcely any of the beds on the Continent resembling
them are ascribed to that age," but to the Miocene. "For as
all Eocene floras approximate more or less to Miocene, it has
been a kind of rule in the absence of strati^raphical evidence, to
assume that all isolated patches with dicotyledons, belonged to
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the latter period, and had the stratigraphical evidence at Bourne-
mouth been inconclusive, the whole of that Eocene formation
must also upon plant evidence (for we have no other) have been
classed as Miocene.
The Lowtr Freshwater series are seen in the neighbourhood
of Corfe and some parts of the cliffs at Studland. It is characterised by abundance of pipe-clays, and is about 2CO
feet thick.
The Middle Fieshwater seriis also occurs at Cofe and Stud-
land, and form the whole thickness of the cliffs between
Poole Harbour and Bournemouth, thus constituting a fine
section, 4 miles long and 100 feet in height,
The next series is marine, and about 400 to 500 feet thick.
This marine group occupies the cliffs between Boscombe and
High Cliff.
The Bournemouth flora appears to consist principally of
trees or hardwood shrubs, few remains of herbaceous plants
being preserved. The ferns are rare in the lower part of
the series, but become more abundant, almost to the exclu-
sion of other vegetation, towards the close of the middle
period.
The prevailing group appears to be that of Acrostichum,

Lower Tertiary Strata of the Isle of Wight.
The Lower and Middle Eocene strata of the Isle of Wight,
especially up to the base of the fhwio-marine series, may be
better stnd'ed in the cliffs in Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay than
in any other part of the island.
In these remarkable sections the whole of the strata from the
chalk to the fluvio-marine formation are displayed in unbroken
succession.
Plastic Clay.
"The lowe-t member of this group of strata in the Isle of
Wight is the Plastic Clay, or Woolwich and Reading series of
Mr. Pre twich." These beds are best examined in Whitecliff
Bav and Alum Bay, especially the former, where the mottled
beds are well exposed. No fossils have occurred in the plastic
clay of the island. Seven beds have been recognised, the whole
measuring 85 feet; they constitute a narrow belt striking across
the island, resting on the chalk.
The London clay succeeds the plastic clay, and also forms a
narrow belt extending aeross the island from the west coast at
Alum Bay to the east at Whitecliff or Culver Cliff; its thickness
is about 200 feet. A band of flint pebbles only 2 inches thick

divides the olasttc clay from the London clay, representing the
basement bed of Mr. Prestwich. Nowhere in Britain can the
London clay be so advantageously studied as at Whitecliff Bay,
or where the characteristic fossils are better exposed. Twenty-
five to thirty characteristic species may be collected here.
Amongst others may be named Pinna affinis, Pectunculus
breidrostris, Pholodamya viargaritacea, Panopea intermedia, and
Modiola dedans. The annelida Ditrupa plana belongs esentially
to the London clay.
Middle Eocene.
Lower Bagshot Beds.
Joshua Trimmer, in 1850, first applied the term Bagshot to the
whole series of strata in Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay. dividing
it into upper, middle, and lower, thus correlating it with the
corresponding series in the London area which had been
previously established by Mr. Prestwich.
The Lower Bagshot beds are greatly developed in the Isle of
Wight, attaining a thickness in Alum Bay of 660 feet, the mist
important Geneva being Elajodendron, Taxites, Quercus, Juglans,
Daphnogene, Laurus, Ca'salpina, Cissia, Ficus, Dryandra,
Hhamnas and Sabal, &c. They comprise a series of variously-
coloured unfossiliferous sands and clays, with ace >mpanying iron
sand tone and clay. These last bed- are in one place crowded
with the leaves of sub-tropical land plants illustrating no less than
19 families, 26 genera, and about 50 species. The Araliacea,

and Corfe Castle in Dorsetshire exhibit an identical but also
richer flora. Out of the great series found at Bournemouth
through the researches of Mr. J. Gardner, fifteen or sixteen
species occur in the pipe-clays of Alum Bay. As a whole they
indicite a rather high temperature. The flora of the Lower
Miocene beds, well known in Central L'urope, has some affinities
with that of our Hampshire basin.
1 he tropical or sub-tropical character of the London clay
plants was long ago worked out by Dr. Bowerbank, but it was
reserved for Dr. De la Harpe to carry his comparison into the
Middle Eocene bed-, and to show that there had been only a
mod-rate decrease of temperature, so far as plants could show,
in the time occupied by the deposition of the Bagshot or
Bracklesham sands. The marine fauna of the same period fully
bears out this conclusion, there being no essential differrnce
between the fossils of the London clay and those of the Bagshot,
or even the Barton beds, which would indi ate a marked change

Ostrea vectcnsis, Nucula similis, Cytherea incrassata, Mytilus,

Brading harbour this grou j may be advantageously studied.
The fourth subdivision, or Bembridge limestone, includes
those beds exhibited at Binsted, Cowes, Calbourn, and Sconce

remember this when correhting the British Upper Eocene
deposits with those of the Continent.
This remarkable limestone in Whitecliff Bay, forms a con-
spicuous feature in the cliffs; it is also the marked feature at
Bembridge ledge. When closely inspected it is found to be
composed of a number of distinct beds or strata. In ascending
order we readily recognise seven divisions, each characterised by
freshwater mollusca and some few land plants.

with beds of the same age in France, Belgium, and Germany,
cannot be overlooked or over-estimated, and often as it has been
attempted, the papers by the two above-named authors have still
greatly added to i.ur know ledge of the stratigraphy of the Eocene
series of the Isle of Wight. It is impossible to dispute the
validity of their researches and value of their sections. The
publication of Mr. Judd's paper disputing the correctness of
Forbes's work and that of the Geological Survey, and the pro-
posal of a fresh classification, drew immediate attention to the
labours of the older authors, but especially that by the Geological
Surveywhich was answerable for the latest, indeed the only
known extended and complete analysis of the Upptr Eocene
strata of the Isle of Wight.
We owe a debt of gratitude to the late Mr. F. Edwards and
Mr. S. V. Wood, for tneir valuable additions to our knowledge
of the paleontology of the fauna of the fluvio-marine beds of the
Hampshire basin. Since the publication of Professor For be.-.'s
memoir upon the Isle of Wight, the molluscan fauna alone is at
least three times as great as noticed by him, and since which the
remarkable fauna of Brockenhurst in the New Forest, discovered
by Mr. Edwards, has been carefully studied by Von Kbnen for

the mollusca, and Dr. Duncan for the corals. These naturalists
have shown the relation an I agreement of this fauna w ith that of
the Lower Oligocene in North Germany. This Brockenhurst
fauna is also identical with certain strata at the base of the
Middle Headon beds at Whitecliff Bay, in the Isle of Wight.
Professor Judd in his paper decribes the s'ratigraphical
position of the Colwell Bay and Headon Hill beds, and their
relation to each other, pointing out what he believed to have been
an error on Forbes's part, relative to the correlation of the "Venus
bed" at two places, in what is really a continuous section,
Edward Forbes and the Geological Survey having carefully and
correctly determined that only one set of marine strata occurred
between the two brackish or estuarine and freshwater series.
This fact has been again most carefully worked out by Messrs.
Tawney and Keeping, leaving no doubt as to the interpretation
and accuracy of the w ork of Forbes and the Survey, and estab-
lishing upon a firmer basis the continuity and equivalency of the
Colwell Bay and Headon Hill marine series, through the "Venus
bed," all being stratigrapbically and palceontologically the same.
Professor Judd insists upon 250 feet of strata intervening
between the Bembridge lime tone and the marine band of Headon
Hill, but Forbes and the Geological Survey in their section
show less than one half of that thickne.-s. Recent research con-
firms this view. At pp. 148-150, the author also endeavours to
how that palaeontological evidence is in accordance with, and as

complete as the stratigraphical. This of course is based upon
the belief that both are read or interpreted rightly. The com-
parison is between the collective fauna of Whitecliff, Colwell
Bay, and Brockenhurst on the one hand, and Headon Hill and
Hordwell on the other hand, but Messrs. Keeping and Tawney
have show n the illogical nature of conclusions drawn from such an
admixture of beds. Each bed should be compared separately.
Professor Judd (on pp. 150164) correlates the British fluvio-
marine strata with that of the Continent, adding at p. 153 of
this paper a li>t of his so-c.illed brockenhurst species from
Whitecliff Bay, Colwell Bay, Brockenhurst, and LyndhmM,
with those species common to the Barton beds below and Hemp-
stead series above. This so-called Brockenhurst, but really
Middle Headon fauna, numbers 84 genera, and 187 species (6i
are MS. names). Four of the 13 corals of the Brockenhurst
beds also occur in, or are representatives of the Oligocene stra a
of North Germany. This conclusion was arrivtd at by Dr.
Duncan, independently of the work of Von Kcinen upon the
mollusca in the same beds.1 The author also prepared a list of
the Hempstead or so-called Middle Oligocene fauna, in which no
less than 40 genera and 101 spec:es are named, 40 of these are

Pal/Eontological Evidence
Having noticed the stratigraphical succession of the several
divisions in the beds at Headon Hill and Colwell Bay, I now
proceed to draw atention to the distribution of the fossils.
The authors of the paper have di-cussed the question as to
whether the Colwell Bay has any more affinity with the Brocken-
hurst fauna than has the Headon Hill bed; and they compare
the fauna both of the Colwell Bay and Headon Hill marine
beds. This they do by separating in tabular form the fauna of
all the localities which are to be compared together. The
splendid collection of Tertiary fossils belonging to the late Mr.
F. Edwards, and now in the British Museum, has formed the
basis of their comparison, while their own researches have added

would cause great inconvenience. The term Middle Headon,
based as it is on the classical work of Edward Forbes, is clear
and definite. Again, it would entail the abandonment of the
names Upper and Lower Headon also; and the non-occurrence
of the Brockenhurst series, or its representative, in Colwell Bay
admits of no recognition on the west side of the island, and
therefore the classification would be based upon a defective
appreciation of the beds.
Von Kcinen, in 1864, ju_-tly correlates the fauna, and since
then, in 1866, the coral fauna has been de cribed by Dr.
Duncan.
Messrs. Tawney and Keeping, in their paper on the beds at
Headon Hill and Colwell bay in the Isle of Wight, uphold the
work done by the Geologinal Survey, maintaining the correctness
and integrity of the two Survey Memoirs, and the horizontal
and vertical sections of the Tertiary beds of the Isle of Wight.
Prof. Judd differs from the identifications and stated succession
of the beds in Totland and Colwell Bays. He introducts two
new series at Headon Hill, a marine and a freshwater (?) in addi-
tion to those which have been universally accepted for the last
twenty-five years (Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
vol. xxxvi.).
The sections prepared by Prof. Judd also differ very consider-
ably from that of the Geological Survey, or those lately pre-
pared by Messrs. Keeping and Tawney, durirg their late exami-
nation of the beds under notice. These are the marine series known as the Middle Headon or Middle Marine. Prof. Judd
places them at the sea level near Widdick Chine. Conse-
quently, between the top of the marine bed and that of the Bern-
bridge limestone, there would be, on Prof. Judd's theory, 250
feet of beds, such being the altitude of the cottage on the
Warren which marks the summit of the Bembridge limestone.
This thickness mu-t, however, be reduced by ico or 105 feet,
which is the altitude of the top of the Middle Headon at this
point. This 105 feet of beds, or another fre-h«ater and another
marine have no existence; they can only be accounttd for by
oountirg the Lower and Middle Headon twice over. Now the
only marine beds are those of the Middle Headon, inclosed
between the altitudes of 70 feet above the sea level; the others
are all fresh water.
The point wherein Prof. Judd's section differs from the
Survry, and that of the authors, arises from the belief that a
second marine series, termed the *' Brockenhurst scries," with
another freshwater below, in all 105 feet, is intercalated above
the Upper Headonthese two believed new formations having
that portion of the section allotted to them which is occupied by
the freshwater Osborne marls and part of the Upper Headon.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
It must be remembered that there is no positive evidence of the
existence of this second marine (Brockenhurst) series at the spot
where the Geological Survey place the Osborne marls. Careful
examination fails to reveal these said to be additional beds. It
is clear, therefore, that no bed having the 1 eculiar fauna of the
Brockenhurst bed occurs at the west end of the i-la d; its place
too, if fcund, Would be at the base of the Middle Headon, and
not above the Upper, where it has been wrongly assigned.
Messrs. Keeping and Tawney, in their paper, object to the
correlation o( the Brockenhurst with the Colwell Bay bed

Headon Hill. Thu> the 105 feet of strata have no existence.
The Middle Headon, which is denuded away from the top of
the cliffs in the centre of Totland Bay between Western and
Widdick Chine-, has been discovered in the Totland Bay 1 rick-yard, which lies a little inland of this portion of the cliff, thus
conclusively showing that this bed » as continuous above the top of the cliff, consequently linking the Warden Cliff expo ure to
that of Headon Hill. They are visibly and ab olutely con-

not occurring at Barton; while there are twenty-six spec us
common to Colwell Bay and Headon Hill, and not occurring at
Prockenhurt. It is clear, therefore, from all fossil and physical
or stratigraphical evidence, that I he position of the Brockenhurst
bed has been misconceived, and it would be fatal to re-name the
whole series of strata hitherto so well known and well deter-
mined as the Middle Marine or Middle Headon of the Isle of
Wight, and call it the "Brockenhurst series." The classifica-
tion and nomenclature of the Geological Survey must therefore
be restored and maintained, all recent examination having
strengthened the previous labours of Forbes and Bristow, and
the later re-e.irches of Messrs. Tawney and Keeping, have still
more firmly established the succession and correlation of the
Middle Headon series of the island, and affording a ba-is for
further research and analysis for the "Anglo-Parisian or Hamp-
shire Tertiary Basin."
Mr. Tawi.ey prepared an important paper upon the Upper
Bagshot Sands of Hordwell Cliff, which was read before the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, and published in their Pro-
ceedings. The object of the communication was to discuss the

affinities of the Bagshot series with a view to their classification,
and also to endeavour to show their correlation and equivalents
in the Paris basin. "All observers are agreed as to the actual
position of the sands being below the fresh-water Lower Headon.
Edward Forbes and the Geological Survey distinctly ally it to
the Marine Bagshot beds. They place it in the Middle Eocene
Bagshot series, terming it Upper Bagshot (instead rf Headon
Hill Sands). Forbes noticed its containing Barton species at
Whitecliff Bay. This leads to or shows its affinity to Barton
beds. Dumont favoured a similar classification in his essay, and
in his table the Headon Hill sands are grouped with the Barton
clay as being respectively equivalent to the upper and lower
divisions of the Belgian Laekenian, while the Headon Hill
limestones and marls are ] laced J' ongrien. Lately these views
have been questioned by the author of the " Oligocene Strata of
the Hampshire Basin," in the Quarterly Journal of the Geo-
logical Society, vol. xxxvi., who regards them as constituting the
lowest DjeiLber of the Headon group, stress being laid upon the
occurrence of Cerithium concavum as a test. The author also
places the whole of the Upper Bagshot sands and the Lower
Middle Headon beds as the equivalents of the Mortefontaine sands, placing them above the St. Ouen limestone; these St.
Ouen beds representing perhaps ihe Osborne, and all three
Headon divisions, which come above the Mortefontaine beds.
Cerithium concavum is said to occur both in the Bagshot and
Headon series. Careful research and examination shows that

the shell in question is Lamarck's C. pleurotomoides in the one
case, and not C. concavum, which species has evidently been
confounded with tbe Lamarckean shell. Examination of equi-
valent beds in France by Mr. Tawney, and the researches of
Prof. Het.ert and M. M-ui.ier-Chalmas clearly show that the
Mortefontaine sands do not contain Cirithium concavum, the
shell so common on that horizon being C. pleurolomoides I amk."
Comparison of the Headon shell with those brought from near
Mortefontaine shows that the Long Mead End species agrees
with the French form. It would appear that there is much
greater parallelism between the French and English series than
we have hitherto expected. The Mortefontaine sands are the
upper part of the Sables de Beauchamp, representing our
Barton beds; above this comes the Calcaire de St. Ouen, chiefly
of freshwater origin. Connected with the St. Ouen limestone
are sands and marls, containing at the top and bottom Cerithium
concavum abundantly.
'Ihe St. Ouen period, therefore, without doubt represents our
Headon series. "In our Hampshire basin the freshwater and
marine condition in the Headon series are not in the same order
as in the St. Ouen beds." "The marine facics in Hampshire,

is said by the author to have one fauna, and the Head mi Hill
Venus bed another. This determination I hold to be untenable,
all fossil and physical evidence being to the contrary, and show
that they are one and the same bed. On both sides of Biamble
Chine the " Venus bed" is fully developed. Mr. Blake calls it
the "oyster bed." Below these come thin bands of .-tratified
marl, with abundance of Cerithia and Cyrcna (not Cyclas, as
stated). The Widdick Chine sands can be no other than the
Headon Hill sands, and not the Upper Bagshots. The altitude
of these sands above the sea Mr. Blake estimated at 100 feet;
this is certainly too great an elevation, 70 feet being the received
measurement by independent ob. ervers. Such difference, if it
existed, would alter the reading and sequence of succeeding and
higher beds in the section. The author seems to have omitted
the Triginocalia and Neritina bed immediately above the How
Ledge limestone and below the thick oyster band. These cor-
respond with the Warden Cliff section, and determine continuity
of deposition, or are a confirmation of the identity of the beds.
This is a crucial point in the continuity and equivalency of the
marine series in Totland and Colwell Bays. The Trigonocalia
bed here is on the same horizon as in Warden Cliff and Colwell

Bay, associated with Cerithium pseudocinctum, Melanopsis fusi-
formis, and Natica labtllata, &c. T he lower or Neritina concava
bed, with Melanopsis fusiformU and Coibicula ovata, occurs also
in the same position near the base of the series at Warden Cliff
and Col well Bay. "This can only be explained by admitting
that the Marine series in Totland Bay and Colwell Bay are
identical." The occurrence of "Cerithium ventricosum at the
top, and the Neritina \N. concava] and Trigonocalia [7*.
deltoidea] at the baseidentical in physical and fossil characters,
are strong presumptive proof of this." It is extremely doubtful
if Ceritheum margarataccum, mentioned on p. 6 of Mr. Blake's
paper, occurs in the Colwell Bay section, or in the western area
of the Isle of Wightthe Ceritheum cinctum is really C. pseudo-
cinctum, and Cyclas obovata should be Cyrena obovata. The
genus Cyclas does not occur. In correlation these are important
items, especially with a continental fauna. It «ill also be found
that the oyster beds do not rest immediately on the How Ledge
limestone as assertedthe Trigonocalia and Neritina beds inter-
vene, and as at Colwell Bay, determine or prove the succession
and identity of the series. At pp. 156-7 Mr. Blake remarks upon
the similarity of the succession of the Colwell Bay beds with
those of Headon Hill, and is "tempted to come to the conclusion"
that the two "Venus beds are identical;" [they have always
been so believed and recognised]; he at the same time states
that "it would be absurd to argue that they are identical because
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
they contain similar common fossils," when it has been "deter-
mined by Prof. Judd that the faunas are remarkably distinct."
We have no other method whereby to determine the age and
synchronism of deposits except through organic remains, and the
fauna? of the "Venus beds " at both localities are to me identical,
and Prof. Blake depends upon fossil evidence all through his
paper, yet evidently he has not carefully examined the more
complete fauna of the "Venus bed" at both localities. In
another paragraph, on p. 157, the author states the proposition
"that the Colwell Bay 'Venus bed' is not certainly identical
with that at Headon Hill, but may occupy a higher horizon.
Mr. Blake suggests that the Headon Hill bed corresponds to the
series intervening between the Colwell Bay bed and the How
Ledge limestone; and that the Colwell Hay bed correspnnds to
the slightly fossiliferous sands immediately belo%v the Headon
Hill limestone. This position < r suggestion certainly cannot be
received. In this case the so-called two "Venus beds" w.-uld
be superposed on each other and nothing to separate them.
The sands referred to are those at the base of the Upper Headon
series, and are freshwater, for they contain Unio. Again, Prof.

and dark clustering yews, relieved in the summer by the lighter
tinted foliage of the spruce and the oak, and in the winter by
the silvery gleam of the birches, that clustered thickly with the
alders in the marshes, and stood out from a dense undergrowth of
sloes and hazels. Among the animals living in this forest of the
North Sea were Sjecies which haunted the valleys of the upper
Seine at the time, such as the southern elephant, the Etruscan
rhinoceros, the deer of the Carnutes, extinct horses, and the
large extinct beaver. There were in addition the shaggy-maned
mammoth, the straight-tusked elephant, and the big-nosed
rhinoceros. The sta;r, the rue, the Irish elk, were in the glades,
Sedgwick's deer, wiih its many-pointed antlers, the verticorn deer, and the gigantic urus. The undergrowth formed a covert
for the wild boar, and for beasts of prey, many in species and
formidable in numbers. The cave bear, the hugest of its kind,
the sabre-toothed lion, the wolf, the fox, and the wolverine.
Among the smaller animals were to be noted the musk shrew,

from the water and disappeared in the forest. Out of thirty
species identified, no less than seventeen are living in some part
of the world, and we have there obviously the stage in the evolu-
tion of mammalian life when the living species were becoming
more abundant than the extinct. We may note, too, the
absence of arctic animals in this fauna, more particularly of the
reindeer.
The presence of these animals in Norfolk and Suffolk implies
that at this time Britain was united to the Continent, and the
presence of fossil species found in France indicate a southern
extension of land in the direction of the Straits of Dover. The
forest covered a large portion of the area of the North Sea, and
in all probability the Atlantic seaboard was then at the 100-
fathom line of the west coast of Ireland.
No traces of man have as yet been discovered in these deposits,
although the large percentage of living species of higher Mam-
malia indicates that the geological clock had struck the hour when
he may be looked for.
The Appearance of the River-drift Hunter at Cray ford and
£rtth.The living species in the forest bed are to be looked
upon as an advanced guard of a great migration of Asiatic and
Africin species, finding their way into North-western Europe,
over the plains of Russia, and over barriers of land connecting
Northern Africa with Spain by way of Gibraltar, and with Italy
by way of M ilia and Sicily (see "Cave Hunting and Early Man").

In the course of time the other living'species followed, and
extinct species became more rare. In the deposits, for instance,
of the ancient Thames, at Ilford and Grays Thurrock in Essex,
and at Eri'h and Crayford in Kent, out of twenty-six species, six
only belong to extinct formsthe new-comers comprising the
lion, wild cat, spotted hyena, and otter, the bisjn, and the musk
sheep. A flint flake discovered by the Rev. Osmund Fisher, at
Crayford, and a second discovered by Messrs. Cheadle and Wood-
ward, at Erith, prove that man was present in the valley of ihe
Thames at this time; while the more recent discoveries of Mr.
Flaxman Spurrell indicate the very spots where the palar bthic
hunter made his implements, and prove that he used implements
of the River drift type, so widely distributed over the surface of the earth. The arctic animals at this time were present, but not
in full force, in Southern Britain, and the innumerable reindeer
which characterise the later deposits of the Pleistocene age had not, so far as we know, taken possession of the valley of the
Thames.
To what stage in the Pleistocene period are we to refer these
traces of the River-drift hunter? The only answer which I am
able to give is that the associated animals are intermediate between
the Forest-bed group and that which characterises the late Pleis-
tocene division in the region extending from the Alps and the

The Riverdrijt Man in India.The researches of Foote,
King, Medlicott, Hacket, and Ball, establish the fact that the
River-drift hunter ranged over the Indian peninsula from Madras
as far north as the valley of the Nerbudda. Here we find him
forming part of a fauna in which there are species now living in
India, Mich as the Indian rhinoceros and the arnee, and extinct
types of oxen and elephants. There were two extinct hi >popotami
in the rivers, and living gavials, turtles, and tortoises. It is plain,
therefore, that at this time the fauna of India stood in the same
relation to the present fauna as the European fauna of the late
Pleistocene does to that now living in Europe. In both there
was a similar association of extinct and living form-, from both
the genus Hippopotamus has disappeared in the lapse of time, and
in both man forms the central figure.
The River-drft Hunter in North America.We are led from
the region of tropical India to the banks of the Delaware in New
Jersey by the recent discoveries of Dr. C. C. Abbott in the
neighbourhood of Trenton. After a study of his collections in
the Peabody Museum in Cambridge, Mass., I have had the
opportunity of examining all the specimens found up to that time,
and of visiting the locality in company with Dr. Abbott and

Professors Haynes and Lewis. The implements are of the same
type as those of the river gravels of Europe, and occur under
exactly the same conditi ins as tho e of France and Britain. Tbey
are found in a plateau of river gravel f inning a terrace over-
looking the river, and composed of materials washed down from
the old terminal moraine which strikes across the State of New
Jersey to the westward. The large blocks of stone and the general
character of the gravel point out that during the time of its accu-
mula ion there were ice-rafts floating down the Delaware in the
spring, as in the Thames, the Seine, and the Somme. According
to Profe-sor Lewis it was firmed during the time when the glacier
of the Delewaie was retreating ('late glacial'), or at a later
period ('post-glacial'). The physical evidence is clear that it
belongs to the same age as deposits with similar remains in
Britain. The animal remains also point to the same conclusion.
A tusk of mastodon is in Dr. Cooke's collection at Brunswick,
New Jersey, obtained from the gravel, and Dr. Abbott records
the tooth of a reindeer and the bones of a bison from Trenton.
Here, too, living and extinct species are found side by side.
Thus in our survey of the group of animals surrounding man
when he first appeared in Europe, India, and North America,
we see that in all three regions, so widely removed from each
other, the animal life was in the same stage of evolution, and
"the old order' was yielding 'place unto the new.' The River-
drift man is proved by his surroundings to belong to the

Pleistocene age in all three.
The evidence of Palaeolithic man in South Africa seems to me
unsatisfactory, because as yet the age of the deposits in which
the implements are found has not been decided.
General Conclusions.It remains now for us to sum up the re-
sults of thi- inquiry, in which we have been led very far afield.
The identity of the implements of the River-drift hunter proves
that he was in the same rude state of civilisation, if it en he
called civilisation, in the Old and New Worlds, when the hands of
the geological clock pointed to the same hour. It is not a lit'le
strange that his u-ode of life should have been the same in the
forests to the north and south of the Mediterranean, in Palestine,
in the tropical forests of India, and on the western shores of the
Atlantic. The hunter of the reindeer in the valley of the Delaware
was to all intents and purposes the same sort of savage as the
hunter of the reindeer on the banks of the Wiley or of the Solent.
It does not, however, follow that this identity of implements im-
plies that the same race of men were spread over this vast tract.
It points rather to a primeval condition of savagery from which
mankind has emerged in the long ages which separate it from
our own time.

In the first place it will be seen from the diagram that the
plateau, in shape somewhat of an irregular rhomboid, is com-
pletely enclosed by six grand ranges of mountains, namely, the
Himalayas looking south toward* India, the Pamir looking west
towards Central Asia, the Altai looking north towards Siberia,
the Yablonoi looking north-east towards Eastern Siberia, the
Yun-ling and the Inshan (inclusive of the Khingan), looking
towards China. These several ranges preserve generally a con-
siderable altitude varying from 6000 to 25,000 feet above sea-
level, and reaching in the Himalayas to more than 29,000 feet.
The tallest of these summits have been accurately measured by
the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Their altitude is
about double that of the highest mountains in Europe, and sur-
passes any al'itnde yet observed in any quarter of the globe.
But as a great part of these several ranges is as yet unsurveyed
by trigonometry, it is pos-ible that still greater heights may be
discovered, and that "excelsior" may jbe the proud answer
rendered by the everlasting hills to human investigation.
Regarding these and the other chains yet to be mentioned, it
must be borne in mind that there are many cross ranges and
transverse lines of mountains. Even the chains, too, often con-
sist of detached groups separated by deep valleys. It is by
observing the position of the groups relatively to one another
that the tendency of the chain can be discerned.
Such being the outer barriers of our | lateau, there are with;n

it two great ranges mainly parallel and running from west to
east, namely, the Kuen-lun and the Thian Shan.
While the Himalayas form the southern flank of the great
Tibetan upland, the Kuen-lun constitutes the northern. The
modicum of knowledge possessed by us regarding the Kuen lun,
a most important factor in the geography of our plateau, is
largely due to the praiseworthy travels of the Russian Preje-
valsky. This range may be said in a certain sense to overlook
the Tarim basin ending in Lake Lob, though the mountains are
actually distant more than a hundred miles from that lake. It
forms the southern boundary of the Tarim basin, which contains
some of the few beautiful tracts in our plateau. If there be such
a thing as a backbone to these regions, or anything like a dorsal
ridge, it consists of the Kuen-lun.
The Thian Shan starts from the Pamir, and runs westward for
full 1500 miles, till it joins with some of its spurs the uplands of
Mongolia proper, or touches with others the dreary desert of
Gobi. As the Kuen-lun forms the southern boundary of the
Tarim bisin, so the Thian Shan constitutes the northern.
Connected with the north-western part of the Himalayas is
another range which some regard as an offshoot, but which

explored, yet its tiue source is known to be in the Kuen-lun
Mountains already mentioned. After quitting our 1 lateau and
passing out of its prison-house in the mountains through natural
gates of the utmost magnificence, it permeates the most thickly-
peopled provinces of Chinaprovinces inhabited by about 120
millions of souls. It sustains the life of this enormous popula-
tion by supplying the necessary moisture and by affording the
means of irrigation and of water-traffic. No river has ever in
ancient or modern times played so important a part in the
increase of the human race as the Yang-tse-Kiang. Its supply
of water is immense and unfailing, and this most essential
characteristic is caused by its connection with the snow-clad and
ice-bound regions of our plateau, within which it has a course of
700 miles before entering China proper. Amidst the tame
Kuen-lun range, the Hoang-ho rises, from unexplored springs,
which the Chinese figure to themselves as "the starry sea."
After bur.-ting through several water-sheds, making wondrous
bends from its main direction near the base of cur plateau, and
changing its course more than once to the confusion of com-
parative geography, it traverses Northern China and confers
agricultural prosperity on some 70,000,000 of souls. It also has

a cour e of some 400 miles within our plateau, in consequence
of which its water-iupply is perennially snow-fed. Again, the
Irawady and the Mekhong, the former watering Burma, and the
latter watering Cambodia, rise in the offshoots of the Kuen-lun.
That region, then, in respect of the parentage of important
rivers stands in the first rank. This beneficent circumstance
aries from thedirection of subsidiary ranges which admit to this
V art of our plateau some of the moisture-laden breezes from the
Pacific Ocean.
Similarly the two Indian river*, the Brahmaputra, and the
Indus with its affluent, the Satlej, have their origin at a great
distance within our plateau, and their water-supply is indefinitely
augmented in consequence. Notwithstanding the vast volume of
their waters, these rivers play an economic part w bich, though
great, is much less than that of the main Chinese rivers. The
Brahmaputra above its junction with the Megna cannot be said
to sustain more than 15,000,000 of people; and the Indus,
together with the Satlej, may support 12,000,000. The Ganges
and Jamna, issuing from masses of .¦-now on the southern scarp of
our plateau, sustain before their junction at Allahabad a popula-
tion of 30,000,000quite irrespective of the deltaic populatirn
of the lower Ganges fur whom moisture is supplied from other
sources. Of these I1.di.1n rivers the waters, perpetually snow-
fed, are largely drawn away for canals of irrigation on a grand
scale. Taken all in all, despi e defects, the Ganges Canal is the

most imposing example of hydraulic engineering that has yet
been seen. From the glaciers of the Pamir and the western
terminus of the Thian Shan there spring the head-streams of the
Oxus, the Jaxarte-, and other rivers, ending in the inland sea of
Aral. To these, in Persian phra e, the epithet of "gold-
scalterer" or "wealth dispenser" is felicitously applied by the
natives.
Of the rivers rising in the northern section of our plateau, the
Amur has posiibilities of which ihe future may see the develop-
ment. But the great rivers of Siberia, such as the Obe, the
Yenisei, at.d the Lena, though flowing through rich soils and
affording marvellous facilities for several systems of inland navi-
gation to be connected with each other, yet have their long
estuaries in the permanently frost-Lound lai.ds of the Tundra,
and their mouths in the Arctic waters frozen during most months
of the year. Therefore they can never, in economic importance,
vie with the rivers above mentioned, which flow into the Pacific
and Indian Oceans.

invasion from spreading even to Western Europe. Though it
is often held that these terrific eveuts have been overruled by
Providence for the progress of mankind, still at the time they
caused what Gibbon truly calls a shipwreck of nations. Not-
withstanding this, the Tartars won, in a certain sense, an
unparalleled success, which is attributed to the geographical
circumstances of our plateau.
The influence of the precipice-, the forests, the prairies, the
wild sports, in forming the national character is -o obvious that
it need not be specified. We readily under.-tand how the
sturdy mountaineer, the daring hunter, the practised archer be-
comes the able soldier. In Mongolia, however, the local
speciality was this, that the practically boundless extent of the
pasturage and the nutritious richness of its quality, induced the
people to maintain countless horses, cows, buffaloes, sheep,
goals, and camels, neglecting the tillage of the soil, never
building houses, but living in tents made of warm felt, accumu-
lating a certain sort of rude wealth, still roving and roaming
about at some seasons incessantly from one encampment or one
grazing-ground to another, dragging with them their families

and their effects by means of the pack animals and the roomy
waggons drawn by many oxen yoked abreast. Thus was a truly
nomadic existence practised on the largest scale ever known.
Mongol armies, better drilled, armed, accoutred, and equipped
than any forces then known in the civi!i-ed world, would
emerge from our plateau into the inhabited plains around, and
would observe houses and towns for the first time. It is even
alleged that some of them had never seen cultivated crops before.
In this state of existence the temptations to depredation of
all sorts were exce sive, and the danger from the climate, the
savagery of nature, and the wild beasts as always imminent.
Consequently the Mongals were obliged to hold themselves to-
gether by the cohesion of families clans and tribes. Thus by
the force of circumstances a social organisation was established
which ] roved the foundation of a military discipline suitable to
the genius of the people, almost self-acting, and unfailing even
in the reinote.-t expeditions. The horses, too, up>n which the
Mongol warriors mainly depended, naturally fell into the
training; being always turned out to graze in herds, they
habitually kept together, and the field manoeuvre fixed habits
which had been already acquired. It used to be remarked that
a line of Mongol cavalry was like a rope or a chain perfectly
flexible but never parted.
The Mongcdian food included little of cereals or vegetables,
but consisted mainly of cheese and meat. For stimulating drink

there was the fermented mare's milk. The name 'krumis' or
'prepared milk,' apparently much esteemed medically now-a-
days, is a Mongolian word. Manifestly, men thus nurtured
could live in the saddle day and night, carrying with them their
sustenance in the smallest compass, and scarcely halting to eat
or drink. Thus the hardihood evinced on jr-itracted marches,
which would otherwise be incredible, can be accounted for.
It is probable that this diet while sustaining vivacity produced
also a violence of disposition. Certainly, ruthlessness, cruelty,
indifference to suffering characterised the Mongols and marred
the effect of their grand qualiies. Massacres, holocau-ts, con-
flagrations marked their warlike operations. Even famines and
epidemics have hardly done more for depopulation than the
Mongol conquests. A Mongolian chief would say that the
keenest enjoymet in life was tos'amp upon a bea'en enemy, to
seize his family, and despoil his encampment.
It is not the purpose of this address to describe the
policy of the Mongols or the institutions which they founded
in conqnered countries. A few salient points onlv have been

At a few points only has our plateau been penetrated by geo-
logical surveys, namely, in some parts of the Altai and at the
western end of the Thian Shan; and these surveys are Russian.
^nt the formations, the strata, the upheavals, the denudations,
the fluvial action, awaiting scientific examination, are indescri-
bably great. A notion of some of the questions inviting inquiry
from the geologist and palaeontologist may be gathered from

the general de-iccation and the subsidence or evaporation of the
primeval waters.

desert, the gradual contraction of the glaciers, the ordinarily
rainless zones sometimes invaded by rain-storms with a downpour
like that of the tropics.
In the eighth place, our plateau is now under one imperial
jurisdiction, and offers many problems for social inquirers. It
belmgs entirely to the Chinese empire with the exception of one
small tract where the Russian authorities have crossed the
mountain border. The geographical features for the most part
favour national defence and territorial consolidation. The old
Chinese Wall is still suitable to the political geography of to-day.
In the Zungarian strait, however, in the Hi valley near Kulja,
perhaps, also, in the line of the Black Irtish, near Zaisan, the
Chinese empire, in its contact with Russia, has weak points
strategically, or chinks in its armour. Though the plateau was
originally under the Chinese suzerainty, it became, under the
Mongolian emperor Chinghiz Khan and his successors, the mis-
tress of China, as indeed of all Asia and of Eastern Europe. As
the Mongol power, however, shrunk and withered, the Chinese
reasserted themselves. At length under a dynasty, from
Manchuria, outside the mountain border, the Chinese became
lords over our plateau. The Zungarian tribe of Eleuths
rose, and after severe military operations were suppressed. The
Muhammadan inhabitants of the Tarim basin rebelled against
the Chinese government, and for a while maintained an inde-
pendent principality for Islam. It was during this time that the
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
British sovereign sent an envoy to Yarkand to conclude a com-
mercial treaty, in 1873. Subsequently the Chinese broke down
this rising independence, and the whole region of the Tarim
receives its orders from the emperor at Pekin.
The decline and fall of the Mongol empire, the disruption of that
wide-spread dominion, like the breaking up of the ice on its own
frozen rivers, are historical themes beyond the scope of thisaddress.
But the changes which have gradually come over the national cha-
racter of the Mongolians are cognate to the studies of geographers.
As already seen, the annals of the Mongols reveal one of the
many examples of the theory of causation, explaining how geogra-
phical surroundings mould or affect the human character. There
remain the mountains, the sea of undulating uplands, which are
still among the few important regions not essentially modified by
human action. The pine forests, though hardly intact, have not
been extensively cleared. There is the dread desertwhere to
the ears of superstitious Mongols the rolls of the mustering drums
and the shouts of victorious battle are audibleand which has
engulfed in sandy waves additional tracts once productive. The
pastoral resources, the nomadic diet and exercises, the tribal
organisation, are in kind the same as of yore, though perhaps

harbours, moles, breakwaters, and lighthouses, and in the art of
navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and
in the construction and adaptation of machinery, and in the
drainage of cities and towns." This definition, written more
than half a century ago, is wide enough to include all branches
of engineering of the present day, although amongst those spe-

this little omission well illustrates and justifies my statement that
the ¦ typical civil engineer of the day is a late product of the
present century; for even Telford never foresaw the vast changes which railways, steam, and electricity would evolve in the course
of a few years.
My predecessors in this chair have on several occasions stated
their conviction that it was better for the author of an address to
confine his attention to the f articular department of engineering
in which he had special knowledge, than to wander over the
whole field of mechanical science. A veil-informed man has

been defined to be a man who knows a little about nerything
and all about something. If you give me credit of being a well-
informed engineer, 1 will endeavour to justify your good opinion
by showing, whil t presiding at these meetings, that 1 know a
little about steam-navigation, and machinery generally; a little
about iron and steel, and other manufactures, and I trust a gcod
deal about the construction of railways, canals, docks, harlours,
and other works of that class.
There have undoubtedly been published during the last fifty
years many works of mark and merit, but the work which above
all others would, I think, have astonished and perplexed cur
ance-tors, is the little one known to all the civilised world as
"iiradshaw.-' This indispensable handbook of the nineteenth
century testifies that the face of the country is dotted over
literally with thousands of railway stations; that between many
of these stations trains run at two-minute intervals, whilst the
distance between others is traversed at a mean speed of nearly
60 miles an hour. The public are often justly indignant at the
want of punctuality on some railways, but tbey should blame
the management, and not the engineers, for the daily conduct
of the heavy traffic between England and Scotland shows, that
notwithstanding the constantly varying condition of wind and
weather in this climate, a run of four hundred miles can, on a
properly laid out railway, and with suitably designed rolling-
stock, be acci milished with certainty to the minute, if the

management is not at fault. On the Great Northern Railway,
for instance, cf which I am consulting engineer, the 400 miles
between London and Edinburgh is traversed in nine hours, or
deducting the half-hour allowed at York for dining, at the mean
rate of no less than 47 miles per hour including stoppages. A
few months ago the Luke of Edinburgh was taken on the same
line of railway from Leeds to Ltndon, a distance of l86j miles,
in exactly three hours, or at a mean rate, including a step at
Grantham, of over 62 miles an h< ur. 1 know of no railway
in the world where this performarce has been eclipsed, and
it will be perhaps both instructive and amu-ing to contrast with
it the performance of the engines at the opening ceremony of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, on September 15, 1830.
A newspaper correspondent of the time, after describing many
eventful incidents of his journey, proceeds as follows: "The
twenty-four vehicles left behind were now formed into one ccn-
tii uous line, with the three remaining engines at their head, and
at tw enty ninutes past five o'clock we set out on our return to
Liverpool. The engires net having the power, however, to

densed, and combustion is aided by the natural draught of the
chimney alone, instead of being urged by a forced blast as on
open portions of the line. Whether a hot-water, a compressed
air, or a compressed gas locomotive could be contrived to meet
the exigencies of metropolitan traffic is a question which, I
think, might be usefully discussed at the present or some future
meeting of the Association.
A reference to the underground railway naturally suggests the
wider que tion of tunnels in general. The consl ruction of
tunnels was not one of the novelties presenting itself to railway
engineers, for many miles of tunnel had been driven by canal
engineers before a single mile of passenger railway had been
built in this or any other country. To foreign engineers belongs
the honour of having boldly conceived and ably accomplished
tunnel works of a magnitude which would have appalled a canal
engineer. I need only refer to the Mont Cenis Tunnel, over 7i
miles in length, commenced in 1857 ard finished in 1870; the
St. Gothard Tunnel, 9^ miles in length, commenced in 1872
and finished in 1882; and the Hoosac Tunnel, 4J miles in
length, commenced in 1854 and finished in 1875. In all cases
rock of the hardest character had to be pierced, and it is need-

less to remark that without the aid of the machinist in devising
and manufacturing compressed air machinery and rock-boring
plant the railway engineer could not have accomplished bis
task. Intermediate shafts are not attainable in tunnels driven
through great mountain ranges, so all the work has to be done
at two faces. In the case of the Mont Cenis Tunnel the mean
rate of progress was 257 feet and the maximum 4C0 feet per
month. In the St. Gothard Tunnel the mean rate was 429
feet and the maximum 810 feet. In the Hoosac Tunnel the
average rate was 150 feet per month.
Tunnels under broad navigable rivers and estuaries have been
a subject of discussion by engine rs for at lea^ a century, but
the only one at present completed is the unfortunate and costly
Thames Tunnel. Two important works of the class are, however,
now well in hand, the Severn Tunnel at Portskewet, and the
Mersey Tunnel at Liverpool. Having reference to this fact, it
will be interesting to quote the following passage from a letter
addressed to the press by a Mr. Thomas Deakin on March 6,
1835, that is to say, more than forty-seven years ago. Mr. Deakin
writes: 'The Great Western Railroad from London to Bristol
w ill be accomplished no doubt, and why not continue it under
the Severn mouth, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, through
Glamorganshire, and to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire? It
would then traverse the coal-field of South Wales throughout its
whole extenta tract of country posessing abo inexhaustible
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
stores of iron-stone. A tunnel was once so proposed to be formed
under the Mersey at Liverpool, and had it not been for the failure
of the Thames Tunnel would most probably have been carried
into effect." It is not a little singular that the two tunnels thus foreshadowed by Mr. Dakin should both be in hand at the present
moment.
Undoubtedly the numerous accidents which occurred during
the construction of the Thames Tunnel, together with its enormous
cost of about 1,500/. per lineal yard, and the eighteen years
occupied in its construction, destroyed the chance of any other
projected subaqueous tunnel for many subsequent years. One
lesson enforced by the Thames Tunnel was the necessity of
leaving a reasonable thickness of ground between the water and
the tunnel. In the Severn Tunnel the minimum thickness is 40
feet and in the Mersey Tunnel 22 feet. The width of river at
the point of crossing of the former tunnel is 2J miles, and the
maximum depth of rails below high water, 163 feet. In the case
of the Mersey Tunnel the width is nearly three-quarters of a mile,
and the depth 144 feet. The Thames Tunnel, as almost every-
one knows, was carried on by means of a special contrivance
termed by Brunei a "shield." No special appliances have been
adopted in either of the Severn or the Mersey Tunnels. Both are

necessitate some such means of communication, I venture to pre-
dict it will be built in accordance with the plan suggested fifty-
nine years ago by the working smith, and not un that of Brunei's
Thames Tunnel, or of any other tunnel yet carried out.
At the beginning of the present century a committee was
appointed to consider the " practicability of making a land com-
munication by tunnel under the River Forth, at or r.ear Queens-
ferry." In a report dated November 14, 1805, it was
recommended that a double tunnel should be constructed at an
estimated cost of 164,000/., or at the rate of 30/. per yard,
exclusive of shafts and pumping. The surveyors reporting,
grounded their belief in its practicability upon the fact that at
Barrowstowness, coal-workings had been carried under the same
Firth for a mile, and at Whitehaven coal was worked for the
samedistance under the Irish Sea, in both places less w nter being
met with under the sea than under the land. The report con-
cludes in the following words: "That a more easy and unin-
terrupted communication betwixt every part ot a country
increases the intercourse of commerce, arts, and agriculture, all
must know. Ferries are still and often a formidable bar in the
road. Of these in this country, the one under review at Queens-

ferry is perhaps the most conspicuous. It is, in fact, the
connecting point betwixt the north and south of Scotland, and
indeed of the realm, and in this point of view the improvement
of it must he considered a national object." These words are
as true and as applicable to the case in 1S82 as they were in
1S05. A ferry still is the only means of communication across
the Forth of Quetnsferry, though the traffic has increased a
hundredfold, i'arlirmnt, by the passing of the Forth Bridge
Act during 'he present session, has given a practical recognition
of the truih of the statement in the above-quoted report, that
the improvement of the Forth passage is a "national object."
As you will receive a paper on the Forth Bridge from my
partne , Mr. Baker, 1 will not trouble you with details of the
proposed structure at the present moment. I may state, however,
tha' after a careful consideration of the difficult problem, in con-
cert with my able colleagues, Mr. T. E. Harrison, the chief
engineer of the North-Eastern Railway, and Mr. W.H. Barlow,
chief engineer of the Midland Railway, we unanimously advised
the directors of the Forth Bridge Company to abandon the pro-
ject for a suspension bridge, and to construct a steel girder bridge
of the unprecedented span of 1,700 feet. The total length of
the structure is ij mile, and it includes two spans, as aforesaid,
of 1,700 feet, and two of 675 fee', over the navigable channels
on each side of Inchgarvie. The execution of the work has been
intrusted to me, and my intention is that the Forth Uridge shall
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
be not only the biggest, but the strongest and stiffest bridge yet
constructed.
Although great navigable rivers offer the most serious impedi-
ments to lines of communication lying at right angles to the
direction of the stream, and necessitate such formidable under-
takings as the Forth Bridge, with a clear headway of 150 feet
above high water, and the Severn Tunnel at a depth of 163 feet
below the same datum, still it must be remembered that such
rivers were the earliest, and are yet the cheapest, highways for
inland communication. Antwerp, the third port in the world,
ranking only after London and Liverpool, owes its commercial
importance undoubtedly to the Scheldt, which affords admirable
wratcr-carriage for a distance of 60 miles from the sea coast in-
land. Ixindon, similarly, is an inland port situated about 50
mile up the Thames; hence one-half of the distance between
. Antwerp and London is made up of fine rivers capable of being
navigated by the largest ocean-going steamers. The practical
result of the existedce of this splendid line of natural communi-
cation is, that iron girders and rails can 1* conveyed from the
heart of Belgium to the metropolis at a far lower price per ton
than fr.ira any ironworks in this country. Unfortunately, the

ment, because no one can dispute the vital importance of
the work to this country. Periodically the question of the
Euphrates Valley Railway is revived, and indeed quite re-
cently I have had to reconsider the question professionally,
but this route can never rival the existing one by the Isthmus
of Suez.
The inauguration of steam navigation to India was much
delayed by the vacillation of the authorities respecting the Suez
and the Euphrates Valley routes. Happily, however, the Arabs
stole the first 1 rig of mails that went by the Euphrates and so in
1S34 a Committee of the House of 'Commons finally resolved
that "steam 1 avigation between Bombay and Suez having in five
successive seasons been brought to the test of ex|eriment, and
the practicability of that line being established, it be recom-
mended to His Majesty's Government to extend the line of Malta
packets to Egypt to complete the communication between Eng-
land and India." Nothing appears to have b en done during the
next two years, hut in 1837 a new paddle-wheel steamer, the
Atlanta, of 650 tons, steamed out to Calcutta, round the Cape
in ninety-one days, and was put on the Red !¦ ea station. She

desert by camels, and down the Nile to Alexandria in four days,
where they remained until II.M.S. Volcano to k them on hoard
on November 7th. At Malta, on November 16th, they were
transferred to II.M.S. Firefly, and finally were landed in this
country on December 4th, having been in all sixty-three days in
coming from Hombay to England. At the present time about
eighteen days are occupied in carrying the mails from Bombay
vifi Brindisi to Ixmlon.
The town of Southampton, where we are now assembled, has
always held a distinguished position in connection with the
development of improved communication with our Eastern
empiie. The opening of the first section of the railway from
1 ondon to Southampton was coincident with the e-tablishtnent
of steam navigation via Egypt to India, and in the same year the
'French engineers at Cairo completed their studies for the
proposed railway across the de-ert to the Suez.
A few months later the I ondon public were startled by an
advertisement headed " Steam to New York," and 94 pasengers
were plucky enough to embark at London, on April 4th, 1838,
in the Sirius, of 700 tons and 320 horse-power, for New York,
where they arrived on the 23rd, having performed the voyage in
seventeen days from London, and fifteen days from Qneenstown.
The Great Western sailed from Bristol on April 7th, and arrived

problem of steam navigation to America successfully solved by
vessels of small size, and capable of maintaining a speed of but
eight to nine miles an hour. I need hardly remind you that
since the year 1838 the ships conducting the enormous traffic
between Europe and America have been of ever-increasing
size and speed. Thus the Britannic, built in 1S74, has an ex-
treme length of 468 feet, a beam of 45 feet 3 inches, a displace-
ment of S,500 tons, and a speed of 16 knots per hour ; whilst the
Servia, built in 1SS1, has an extreme length of 530 feet, a beam
of 52 feet, a displacement of 13,000 ton-, and a speed of 18
knots, and the City of Rome, built in the same year, has a length
of 6co feet, a beam of 52 feet 3 inches, and a displacement of
13,500 tons. Another Atlantic liner, the Alaska, having a length
of 500 feet, a beam of 50 feet, and a displacement of 12,000
tons, attained .1 speed of iSJ knots on the measured mile, and
has done the distance between Queenstown and New York in
seven days four hours and thirty-two minutes, and the re'urn
voyage in six days and twenty-two hours, a mean ocean speed of,
say, 17 knots per hour, or more than double that of the first
steam vessels trading in America.

University College, London, has supported the action of the

and to its libraries, thus throwing Of en to them a full training in
these fields of study. The London School of Medicine for
Women, near University College, although not connected with
it, is the only institution in England that trains women for
degrees in medicine and surgery, and is formally recognised by

sculpture have long enjoyed the advantages of the Slade School,
which is an important part of one Faculty of Arts in University

On all these accounts the neighbourhood of the College has

to a survey of the coasts of Novaya Zemlya. His narrative of
the-e voyages still forms one of the richest sources of our know-

commanded a Russian exploring expedition around the world,
in which he was accompanied by a scientific staff. He explored
the Russian shores of Asia and America, and discovered several
island groups in the Pacific. Promoted in 1829 to the rank of
Captain, he was in 1832 made Adjutant to the Emperor
Nicholas, and tutor of the Grand Duke Constantine, whose
curator he was from 1847 to 1852. Having been promoted to
Adjutan'-General in 1842, and Vice-Admiral in 1845, Lutke was
in 1851-3 Military Governor of Revel and late of Kronstadt. He
was made Admiral in 1855. He was in 1845 founder of the
Russian Geographical Society, and since 1864 president of the
St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. He was made a Count in
1866. In J828 Liitke published the narrative of his Arctic expe-

Kinch on the Soy bean (So/a liispida). This bean, of which
there are a dozen or more varieties known in the East, is very
largely used as an article of food in Japan and China, where it
is manufactured not only into soy, now exported in considerable
quantities to Europe, but also into bean cheese and other forms
of food. The soy bean in its proximate composition approaches
more nearly to animal food than any other known vegetable
production, being singularly rich in fat and in albuminoids, and
it i. therefore a valuable adjunct to the food of the almost vege-
tarian Japanese. Of late years, especially since the Vienna
International Exhibition, many efforts have been made to
acclimatise this bean in various parts of the European continent,
chiefly in Hungary and Germany. France and Italy have also
attempted it, and some of the experiments have been fairly suc-
cessful. We notice that Prof. Kinch is trying to grow some of
the varieties in the botanic garden at Cirencester, and though
our climate is probably too uncertain and the temperature often
too low for most of the varieties to attain perfection, still if any
of them could be acclimatised a valuable leguminous cross would
be added to our present list. The paper contains detailed
analyses of the bean as grown in different countries, of several of
the foods made from it, of its straw, which is a useful fodder,
and of the ash of the bean and straw.

new regulation;-, in accordance with »hich this examination was
conducted, differed in many particulars from those of the previous
year, but principally: (1) in the increased number of subjects of
examination; (2) in the substitution of two for three grades;
(3) in the permission accorded to candidates to be re-examined
in the same grade for a certificate of a higher class; (4) in the
reversion to the rule which had previously been in force of exa-
mining candidates in one subject only. These differences have
to be considered in comparing the results of this year's examina-
tion with those of the previous or of any other year. At the
recent examination in technology, 1972 candidates presented
themselves. This number represents, however, a small propor-

The Cluster Fr-esepe.At the sitting of the Academy of
Sciences of Paris on the 14th inst., a paper was presented by M.
Wolf, giving a description of this well-known star-cluster, and
micrometric measures of the relative positions of its principal
components. M. Wolf made use of the same methods and
instruments of the Observatory at Paris which he had employed
in 1S73-75, in his elaborate scrutiny of the Pleiades. His work
upon Pracsepe comprises three sections: I. the micrometric de-
termination of the relative positions of its principal stars, to the
number of 82, with the filar-micrometer used in 1873-75. The
positions of the 82 stars are given relatively to t Cancri, and are
reduced to the beginning of the year 1877, for which epoch the
place of the reference star is in R.A. 8h. 33m. 23s. 75, N.P. D.
"0° l' l8"'o; these stars are between the seventh and eleventh
magnitudes. II. The micrometric determination of the relative
positions of all the stars in the group to the twelfth magnitude
comprised in a rectangle of eight minutes of time by ninety
minutes of arc, these determinations being made with the micro-
meter constructed by M. Wolf for the rapid registration of
groups of stars, the places being given to a tenth of a minute of
arc by reference to the accurate positions of section I. ; this
second catalogue includes 188 stars. III. A revision by actual
comparison with the sky of the chart of positions so formed, and
the insertion of stars omitted or lower than the twelfth magnitude;
the chart thus completed contains 363 stars.

Unfortunately there are few ancient observations for com-
parison. The Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences (first series)
contain two charts of the cluster, one formed by Cassini and
l.ahire in 1692, the other by Maraldi in 1707, but they only
-ene for identification of certain stars, and give neither positions
nor exact magnitudes. In 1790 Le Monnier published a cata-
logue of 31 stars, of which 18 occur within the limits of M.
Wolf's chart; 15 of these correspond to his observed positions,
with a mean error of io^s. in R.A. and ±13" in N.I'.D. Le
Monnier's Nos. 7, it, and 19 do not correspond within these
limits to any existing stars, but there is no reason to infer great
displacement, since I.alande assigns positions which nearly agree
with M. Wolf's.
Prof. Winnecke observed some years since with the Bonn
heliometer the principal stars in this cluster, but his results are
not yet published. In 1870 Prof. Asaph Hall published a cata-
logue of 151 stars observed at Washington in the years 1864-

ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE
Animal Intelligence. By George J. Romanes, M.A.,
LL.D., F.R.S., Zoological Secretary to the Linnean
Society. International Scientific Series. (London:
Kegan Paul, Trench, and Co., 1882.)
THE psychology of animals having hitherto been
treated only in detached portions, and for the most
part in an uncritical manner, Dr. Romanes has "thought
it desirable that there should be something resembling a
text-book of the facts of comparative psychology, to which
men of science, and also metaphysicians, may turn when-
ever they may have occasion to acquaint themselves with
the particular level of intelligence to which this or that
species of animals attains." But this is only one of the
objects with which he has undertaken the treatment of
the psychology of animals. The second and more im-
portant object "is that of considering the facts of animal
intelligence in their relation to the theory of Descent."
The present volume supplies the basis for this mode of
considering the facts. "While complete in itself as a
statement of the facts of Comparative Psychology," it is
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
preliminary to a second division of the work, which is to
be brought out as a separate treatise under the title of
"Mental Evolution."
Since the present volume is to be regarded as the first
part of a scientific treatise, it is, of course, important that
we should know the critical principles on which the facts
have been selected. Dr. Romanes- has stated these in
his preface. It will not be denied that his canons of
criticism are sufficiently severe ; and in the book itself
we do not receive that impression that the facts are being
described without careful discrimination, which often
makes itself felt in reading collections of anecdotes about
animals. But, considering the possibilities of the subject,
most readers will look for descriptions which may be
scientifically accurate or not, but which, in either case,
are interesting in themselves. And, notwithstanding the
intention he has expressed, "as far as the nature and cir-
cumstances of the inquiry would permit, to suppress
anecdote," Dr. Romanes has written a book that is very
pleasant to read. Besides this, the materials are arranged
in such a way that there is no difficulty in finding any fact
that it is desired to refer to.
Dr. Romanes points out more than once " how slightly
a psychological classification of animals depends upon
zoological affinity, or even morphological organisation"
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
(p. 241). The zoological classification is followed for the
sake of its convenience, but at the same time it has, of
course, been found necessary to treat some groups in
much more detail than others. "Anatomically, an ant
or a bee does not require more consideration than a
beetle or a fly; but psychologically there is need for as
great a difference of treatment as there is in the not very
dissimilar case of a monkey and a man " (Preface, x.).
As an example of the mode of classifying the facts relating
to each group, the chapter on Ants may be referred to.
First the researches are described that have been made
in order to determine the exact character of the special
senses of ants, and of the "sense of direction." After
Vol. xxvi  No. 671
this, the powers of memory and recognition are considered, then the emotions. Then follow sections on the
powers of communication, the habits, and the general
intelligence of ants. Lastly, there is a short section on
the nervous system and the sense organs; but this is not
represented in the chapters dealing with other animals.
Though the complete theoretical treatment of mental
phenomena in animals does not belong to the present

450
{Sept. 7, 1883
NATURE
discussing, for example, the question of the general intel-
ligence of ants, Dr. Romanes speaks of "the difficulty of
drawing the line between purposeless instinct and pur-
posive intelligence." He then goes on to say, " It will be
remembered that our test of instinctive as distinguished
from truly intelligent action is simply whether all indi-
viduals of a species perform similar adaptive movements
under the stimulus supplied by similar and habitual cir-
cumstances, or whether they manifest individual and
peculiar adaptive movements to meet the exigencies of
novel and peculiar circumstances" (p. 123). Now this
distinction between instinct and reason, when it comes to
be applied, does not seem to be essentially different from
the distinction between mental and reflex action. The
distinction of instinct as having an element of conscious-
ness from mere reflex action which is unconscious, seems
to vanish in the actual treatment of the subject; and the
way of answering the question as to instinct that suggests
itself most strongly is to define it with Mr. Spencer as
"compound reflex. action," placing both instinct and
reflex action, as merely mechanical processes, in opposi-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
tion to all conscious action.
If we take this view, we must regard all animals from
the lowest to the highest as having a certain measure of
"general intelligence." In the higher animals this
general intelligence may be as highly developed as the
mechanical processes described by the term instinct.
For example, Dr. Romanes says, in speaking of the
beaver, "It is really impossible by the closest study of
the psychology of this animal to distinguish the web of
instinct from the woof of intelligence; the two principles
seem here to have been so intimately woven together, that
in the result, as expressed by certain particular actions, it
cannot be determined how much we are to attribute to
mechanical impulse, and how much to reasoned purpose"
p. 367). Now there seems to be an advantage here in
confining the term instinct to the mechanical processes
and calling all the rest " general intelligence." And Dr.
Romanes, except in the Introduction, seems to have
looked upon the facts in this way. But in considering
the question how the terms should be defined, the diffi-
culty no doubt presented itself that reflex action, instinct,
and reason are usually thought of as an ascending series.
This, however, is merely because the animals in which
reflex, instinctive, and rational action respectively are
most prominent, form an ascending series in the scale of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
intelligence. The difficulty disappears when we regard
all animals as having some general intelligence; for we
can arrange them in an ascending series (as Dr. Romanes
proposes) according to the amount of consciousness pos-
sessed by them; contrasting all along the line "non-
mental neuro-muscular adjustment" (simple or "reflex,"
and compound or "instinctive") with the mental life
properly so called.
That all animals have some consciousness, some
'general intelligence," is regarded as probable by Dr.
Romanes; and perhaps the most interesting portions of
the book are the early chapters in which he proves the
presence of an element of consciousness in animals very
low in the zoological scale. "Even the headless oyster,"
quotes from an unpublished MS. of Mr. Darwin,
to profit by experience." And this power of
Nv experience, it must be remembered, is the
test of rational as distinguished from instinctive action. But we find evidence of conscious purpose even below mollusca. Dr. Romanes records an observation nude':
himself on rotifers, and says that if we were to depend upon appearances alone, this one observation would::
sufficient ground for attributing conscious determination to these microscopical organisms (p. 19). Then after quoting " some observations relating to the lowest ofi!
animals and made by a competent person," he ram,;

we see here both the continuity of instinct with reflex
action and the constant opposition that there is between
mechanical quasi-mental action and free intelligence. On
the one hand the organism tends to become excessively
specialised by the development of instincts under the
influence of natural selection and by the formation of
habits ; on the other hand rational processes are constantly
being applied to slightly different material, thus becoming
more varied, and instincts when they become too complex
are partially disorganised and contribute their share to
the activity of the free intelligence. Thus, starting with
a lowly organised animal having the beginnings of intel-
ligence and reflex action, that is, having the germs of the
mental and quasi-mental processes of the higher animals,
we observe from this point onwards both a process of
development of each kind of action along its own line and
a process of transformation of each kind of action into
the other.
In some ancient civilised societies of men, habits which
were originally special applications of reason to particular
ends have encroached to such an extent on the free intel-

ligence that almost the whole of life has become mecha-
nical routine. If the specialising tendency can go so far
in the case of men, may we not expect to find animals
rather high in the zoological scale (perhaps some species
of insects) in which all the mental activity has passed
into the form of instinctive processes? The comple-
mentary problem to that of finding evidences of intelli-
gence in the lowest animals would be that of finding evi-
dences of the absence of intelligence in the higher animals.
In discussing ants Dr. Romanes remarks that some species
do not seem to have general intelligence in proportion to the
complexity of their instincts, though "other species . . .
appear to be as remarkable in this respect as they are in
respect of their instinctive adjustments" (p. 127). But
if there is a constant struggle between instinct and intel-
ligence, an animal in which instincts have been fixed so
rapidly that all the plastic intelligence has been absorbed
in forming them is quite possible, and might be found
perhaps among insects. Such an organism would be a
realisation of the idea of Descartes that animals are
unconscious automata. T. Whittaker

7th Edition. (London: J. and A. Churchill, 1882.)
THE seventh edition of this excellent work shows on
almost every page that the author has submitted
the previous edition to careful revision, with the result of
producing a much better book in every respect. State-
ments are made more concisely and to the point; irrele-
vant or useless illustrations are suppressed ; redundant
sentences have been clipped and pruned till they express
their meaning in the shortest form. Further, the arrange-
ment of the book has been much improved. In the 6th
edition, Dr. Dalton discussed the subject under the heads
of "Nutrition," "The Nervous System," and "Repro-
duction," whilst in the present edition he has subdivided
the first section into "Physiological Chemistry" and
"Nutrition," properly so called. This arrangement has
enabled him to describe more fully the chemical com-
position of proximate principles and to arrange the facts
in a more natural order. As a matter of logical arrange-
ment, it is doubtful how far Dr. Dalton is justified in
treating of the Bile under " Digestion," and the Glyco-

deficient in fulness, no one can refuse a compliment to
the skill with which the learner is led on step by step
through the intricacies of reproduction and development.
The popularity of the work is likely to give Dr. Dalton
the opportunity of preparing another edition, and we
would suggest, in particular, that further details be given
as to the physiology of muscle. A student who has a fair
knowledge of the structure of muscular fibre, its chemical
composition at rest and in action, its relations to the
nervous system, and, in short, the history of its life, has a
good grounding in the fundamental principles of physio-
logy. Again, the accounts of the ultimate changes in the
respiratory process, of the functions of the kidney, and of
secretion are meagre, and give an amount of knowledge
not likely to satisfy the requirements of various examining
boards in this country. The histology of the tissues and
organs might also, with advantage, be given more fully.
When a teacher writes a text-book it may be taken
as an indication of his method of teaching the subject,
but often the order in which subjects are discussed is
changed from a desire to give a logical and systematic

exposition. To deluge a beginner with a sea of facts
relating to the chemical composition of the body is likely
to confuse him and to make the subject distasteful, but
whilst this is a caution to the teacher, it is quite justifiable
for an expositor in print to begin with such wearisome
details. With Dr. Dalton's method little fault can be
found. He leads a beginner, by easy stages, through
many difficult problems, whilst it is clear he has thought
out the matter for himself and thus can clearly indicate
how much may be taken as fact and how much may be
accepted as theory.
Whilst Dalton's "Physiology " is not on a level with
that of Dr. Michael Foster in being a representation of
the most advanced opinions in physiological science, nor
with Hermann's "Physiology" (translated by Prof.
Gamgee), Beaunis' "Physiologic," Landois' "Lehrbuch
der Physiologie des Menschen," or Carpenter's "Human
Physiology," as a repertory of facts, it is a compendium
well suited, on the whole, for a student of medicine. As
a rule, successive editions of a popular work become
larger, but in the present instance the author has been
able to sift and refine so as to save space, without injuring
the quality of his work. JOHN G. McKendrick

The authors of this work have earned for themselves so
high a reputation by their numerous and successful ex-
periments in the synthesis of minerals and of rocks, that
we may almost take for granted the thoroughness of the
work now issued. Till the appearance of this volume the
results obtained since 1872 (when a similar compilation
was published by Kuchs) were to be sought in scattered
memoirs; all results up to the present date are here col-
lected into a single treatise, provided with an excellent
set of indices. In an interesting but brief introduction
(thirty pages) the advantages accruing to mineralogy and
petrology from these syntheses are pointed out and the
various methods of experiment explained. The next fifty
pages are devoted to the experiments having for aim the
synthesis of rocks, and the remainder of the volume (300
pages) to those which have resulted in the reproduction
of minerals. In each instance careful references to the
original memoirs and a distinct statement of the application of the results to geology are given. The book:

eich other in dialectic forms. Not only do these totem-classes
regulate marriage and descent, but the sub-classes i.e. their well-
known form as Ipai-Kumbo and Muri-Kubi, do so likewise, and
moreover the two primary classes which I have now succeeded
in tracing out over the area named are those in fact in consider-
ing the legality of marriages the aborigines finally look. It is,
in fact, these two primary classes which, through their four sub-
divisions and the group of totem names, imperatively regulate
marriage. They are the tw exogamous intermarrying groups
into which the tribe in its social organisation is divided. The
marriage of two individuals belonging to one primary class is
regarded in the light of incest, and is very generally punished by
death. Thus the objections which have been taken that the
class-names do not influence marriage and are mere terms of
address receive renewed and positive contradiction from accumu-
lating evidence.
As to the objections taken to my statement of the practice of
marriage by elopement among the Kurnai, I have little to add to
the full account I have given in my work in that tribe. Mere
denials of its existence, mere statements that marriage by elope-
ment is a "product of misconception," do not alter the fact that

the practice existed in Gippsland, as I have stated it. The diffi-
culty which has been raised as to the elder men obtaining wives
and second wives amounts to nothing. It may interest my
critics to know as one instance that the man King Charley,
whom I mentioned in"Kamilaroi and Kurnai," obtained his
first wife from Maneroi by elopement; he obtained his
second wife from the Wurnfingatti division of the Kurnai also by
elopement, leaving his first wife with some friends during this
proceeding. In addition to these cases, in which elder men
obtained wives, or second wives, in Gippsland by (1) capture;
(2) inheritance from deceased brothers (own or tribal); (3) by
the rare cases of gift by the woman's relatives or by exchange of
a female relative, will be found by those who desire to find the
evidence in "jKumilaroi and Kurnai."
It is an error on the part of our critics to suppose that in
Australia it is general, or even very frequent for the elder men
to monopolise all the women. The young men acquire wives in
various manners in various tribes, as by arrangement by rela-
tions, by exchange of sisters, by betrothal, by elopement, or as
among some of the Kamilaroi tribes, by an absolute ri«ht of
selection by the " initiated youth " of any unmarried girl of the
proper class-name, provided bis hands are free of the blood of
her kindred.
It has been asserted by more than one of our critics that "the

are not in all Australian tribes secret names. In tribes within
my knowledge personal names, class-names, totem-names, terms
of relationship, are all used in addressing individuals. There is,
therefore, no necessity in such tribes for individuals to have
recourse to an invented system of fictitious relationships for the
purpose of addressing each other, such as some of our critics
believe in. The terms of relationship define groups, and the
individual takes the name of his group. These groups have a
real existence. For instance, in the tribe which occupied the
table-land of Maneroo, it was the males of the two primary class
divisions which met as two groups to mutually iniiiate their
youths, that is, to confer upon them the privileges of manhood.
It was the group " Jambi" of each intermarrying primary class-
division which, under the control of the old men of the tribe
initiated the youths of the other group. The youths being
initiated are also "Jambi." It was one jambi who gave a wife
to the other Jambi, receiving his sister in exchai ge, and the
relationship of Jambi included therefore "sister's husband" as
well as "wife's bother"; but it was not imperative that the
"sister " should be an "own sister," for she might be a "tribal

Habits of Spiders
Your correspondent, Mr. Frank Kowbotham, in his letter on
the '* Habits of Spiders" (vol. xxvi. p. 386), gives it as his
opinion that a spider shakes the web from a desire "to effect
concealment when it feels danger is near." I am inclined to
think it does so from a feeling of anger. During a long resi-
dence in the tropics, I often amused myself irritating spiders
and watching their conduct. I noticed that they generally seized
the web and shook it up and down in the manner described by
your correspondent, but some of the spiders were of so great a
size as to render concealment by such a manoeuvre quite hopeles?,
and I attributed their behaviour to other motives. They appeared
to me more to resemble angry monkeys than anything else. I
have not unfrequently seen the latter when annoyed jumping up
and down on all fours with their tails erect in the air, or if con-
lined in a cage seize the bars bp their hands and feet and shake
them as the spiders did their webs. \V. J. C.

THE RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS OF
INSECTS
THE respiratory movements of some of the larger
insects are quite apparent, and have been described

by various observers. A German naturalist, Herr Rathke,
published in 1861 a memoir in which he compared those
movements, observed with the naked eye and a magni-
fying glass, in insects of all the principal types.
According to M. Plateau (who has lately studied the
subject, and has made a preliminary communication of
his results to the Belgian Academy), though Rathke's
memoir is very remarkable, he overlooked many details,
and fell into sundry errors, owing to the difficulty of the
inquiry.
Haussmann (1803) suggested a method of indicating
the movements of dilatation and contraction of an insect's
abdomen, by oscillations of a liquid column; but he
recognised that it would apply only to articulata of large
size, and it seems incapable of yielding very exact
results.
M. Girard (1873) proposed encasing the insect's abdo-
men with a thin envelope of caoutchouc having a style
attached which would inscribe the movements.
It is a form of the graphic method that M. Plateau
first adopted. He confined himself to perfect insects, and

7. When there is a pause in the respiratory phrases it
always occurs in inspiration.
8. In all insects vigorous enough to furnish suitable
curves (such as the large Coleoptera) one finds that the
inspiration is usually slower than the expiration, and that
the latter is often sudden (confirming an observation by
Sorg in 1805).
9. In most insects expiration is alone active, inspiration
being passive, and due to elasticity of the teguments and
the tracheal walls. (This confirms previous observa-
tions.)
10. Nearly all insects possess only expiratory muscles.
M. Plateau has found muscles aiding inspiration not only
in Hymenoptera and Acridians (Rathke, Graber), but in
Phryganeidte.
11. The superior and inferior diaphragms of Hymen-
optera have not the role Wolff attributes to them (a con-
firmation of objections by Graber).
12. Many insects, perhaps all, perform, with their
abdomen, general movements, sometimes small, some-
times very ample, which do not coincide with respiratory

movements, properly so called, and must be distinguished
from them.
13. The respiratory movements of insects are purely
reflex, persisting in the decapitated animal, and even in the
isolated abdomen in forms whose nervous system is not
condensed. In the latter case these movements are
excited or retarded by the same causes which excite or
retard them in the intact insect (a confirmation of previous
observations).
14. The metathoracic ganglions are not, as Faivre sup-
posed, special respiratory centres (a confirmation of the
views of Barlow and Baudelot on Libellulae).
15. The abolition of respiratory movements by destruc-
tion of the metathoracic ganglions in Dytiscidae and
other Coleoptera, results from the condensed state of
their nervous system, in which a certain number of
abdominal ganglions are fused with those of the meta-
thorax.
16. In insects with a condensed nervous system the
excitation or partial destruction of a complex nervous
mass resulting from the union of successive ganglionary
centres always affects all the centres entering into the
constitution of this mass.

T N the account given in Nature, vol. xxv. p. 294, the
1 eruption that has been going on in December was
described up to the last day of 1881. As the height of
the lava column had been diminished by the lateral out-
lets, the surface was consequently some considerable
distance below the lip of the crater, its level on ordinary
occasions being only a few metres below.
Under ordinary conditions the ejectamenta consist of
masses of fluid lava blown out as the spray from an
effervescing liquid. They form the so-called lava cakes,
being flattened out by their fall, while still plastic. They
are usually very spongy, or scoriaceous, and rapidly
disintegrate. In the present instance, however, as the
vapours quitted the lava at some considerable depth,
these plastic masses could not reach the surface. This
rapid escape of vapour through the narrow tube between
the lava surface and the crater lip, was under analogous
conditions to the powder gas in a fire-arm. If, for
instance, we imagine a cannon, whose bore is composed
of materials easily broken up, we have a rough illustration
of what takes place. The lava-cakes were replaced by

Till January 14 no glimmer even was visible from
Naples. On that evening, howe.er, there was a slight
red reflection, which continued till the 24th, when much
vapour was escaping. The next day it became quiet.
February 2, slight glimmer visible again.
From February 19 to April 23, the mountain remained
very quiet; only the slightest glimmer visible at night.
That day I visited the crater.
The crater and its rim of December and January
occupies about one-third of the plain of lava filling the
1872 crater. The former overlaps the latter in a north-
east direction, and is not therefore concentric. As we
cautiously mount its northern edge to avoid the falling
scoria cakes, it is seen that the craterial hollow has very
steep sides, about 40 metres deep, and 150 metres in
diameter. It showed the usual interlamination of lava
and its fragmentary products. Rising from its floor was
a small cone of eruption, that had been building up since
the beginning of the year, its centre, of course, occupied
by the vent, but no crater. The fissure mentioned in my
last report was gradually filling up by the crumbling in of

its sides; there was still oozing a small stream of lava
from its lower extremity. This gentle flow of fluid rock
had been going on without interruption since December,
and during that period had been thrown out to a consider-
able amount, which, however, from slow exit soon cooled
and had not enough impetus to travel far, chiefly piling
itself up at the toe of the cone, and spreading a short dis-
tance over the Atrio and Valle dell' Inferno.
On May 13, became slightly more active, which con-
tinued till the 17th, the day of the eclipse of the sun. On
that evening the reflection was very brilliant from a much
increased flow of lava on the same side. From May 18
till June 6, gradually diminishing activity, especially
during the last week. During the 4th and 5th, Prof.
Palmieri recorded a continued uneasiness, as shown by
the Vesuvian Observatory and University seismographs.
That disturbance was the forerunner of a sharp earth-
quake shock, which occurred at 4-47 a.m. at Isernia and
Vinchiaturo in the Appenines. At 8 a.m., when I scanned
the crater with a glass, there seemed to be an increased
volume of vapour from the fumaroles, and the main
column was much more bulky and dense. In the evening
the explosions reached a considerable height, and were
verv brilliant. On the 7th the same, but on the 8th quieter.

energy exhibiting its focus of intensity in a mountain
range, yet at the same time setting up sympathetic
activity in the neighbouring volcano. In fact, I believe
that if more accurate and regular observations were
carried on of earth tremors and the phases of volcanic
activity, at many points scattered over such a country as
Italy, much might be learned of the internal anatomy
and physiology, so to speak, of such an area.
I say Italy in particular, for many reasons. The prin-
cipal, however, are its simple structure, thus avoiding the
various complications that must necessarily arise if its
geology were very intricate. Again, the history of many
of its principal seismic events are far more complete and
extend farther back than that of any other country. In
fact, we may look forward to the time when seismology
and vulcanology will be placed on much the same basis
as meteorology, and probably with equally important
results.
The mountain from the last date to the 29th remained
tranquil, no reflection being discernible at night. That
evening, however, the ejections were to be seen distinctly.

Debreczin is a great Calvinist centre. It has been
called the " Rome of Calvinists." There is a Calvinist
College which educates nearly 2,000 children, boys, and

publications including a fine volume giving a complete

has cost the municipal authorities 6000 florins. In the
evening we all dined together. On the following day the
Presidential Address was delivered at 10 a.m. This was
followed by the reading of letters of salutation from
various parts of Hungary. A paper was then read by
Prof. Torok one of the Vice Presidents on the Meteorites
of Hungary, and specially on the Kaba meteorite which
fell near Debreczin in 1857. This was the period of the
Austrian domination, and many meteorites had already
been taken from Hungarian museums and transferred to
Vienna. A demand was at once made for the Kaba
meteorite to be similarly transferred, but the Debreczin
authorities answered, " It is true that you have a right to
everything on and beneath the earth of Hungary, but
this came from Heaven. Hence we propose to keep it
here." And it remains in the Debreczin Museum. After
the meteorite paper an eulogium was pronounced by Dr.
Popper on Dr. Albert Kain, a recently deceased and pro-
minent citizen. A short paper on children's diseases
was then read by Prof. Bodogh, and the proceedings termi-
nated at 1 p.m. Soon afterwards the members sat down

At S o'clock a lecture was given by Dr. Kiss on
Hatvani, a professor of physics in the Debreczin College
of the last century. He studied in Leyden and was the
first to introduce experimental illustration into the college
lectures. A good deal of his apparatus was exhibited
and the air-pump with a huge horizontal barrel two feet
in length and three inches in diameter, was particularly
interesting. In principle it scarcely differed from Robert
Boyle's second air-pump of the preceeding century.
At 9 a.m. on the following day the three sections were

Meteorology of Hungary. He dwelt particularly on the
great evils resulting from the cutting down of forests,
and the climatal changes likely to result therefrom. As

The Report of the Committee consisting of Prof. Balfour
Stewart, Thorpe, and Riickir, appointed at the York Meeting to
Retort on Methods of Calibrating Mercurial Thermometers was
read by Prof. Riieker. Thermometer tubes are in general of
unequal bore in different parts, and the indications of the instru-
ments will thus be erroneous, unless these irregularities are
a 1 owed for. If a short column of mercury broken off from the
main mass in the bulb and tube be measured in different pirts of
tiie tube, its length will be greater in the narrower, and less in
the wider part--. By means of such measurements the correction
for the inequalities in the bore can be applied in two different
ways distinguished as methods of calibration and correction
respectively. In the first the length of the column of mercury
is measured in various parts of the tube before the scale is etched
on it, and the lengths of the divisions are then so adjusted as to
make equal differences of scale readings correspond to equal
volumes. In the second the tube is in the first instance furnished
with a uniform scale, and a table of corrections is afterwards
drawn up, by means of which the same end is attained as before.
In either ca-e the measure nents have to be made in some sys-
tematic manner, and a number of different methods of perform-
in/ the ob ervations and calculations have from time to time
been proposed. That in use at the Kew Observatory is the
simplest of all, while the more elaborate methods have for the
mist part been proposed by German writers. The report con-

si .ted of a minute discussion of the relative merits of these
various methods, the chief of which had been applied by the
Committee to the same thermometer, so that the results could be
readily compared. The measurements for this purpose were
made in the Physical Laboratory of the Yorkshire College. The
methods chiefly investigated were Gay Lussac's, Hallstrom's,
Ihiessen's, Marek's, Rudberg's, and Bessel's, both as modified
by von Oettingen, and al o with further modifications introduced
by Professors Thorpe and Rucker. As the result of a long
theoretical and experimental investigation, the Committee con-
clude that labour is saved and equal accuracy secured by the
repetition of the simplest method of correction (Gay Lussac's),
instead of the employment of more elaborate and theoretically
more perfect schemes.

Analysis (drawn up by Dr. Schuster).The report consists

investigations seems to be that though the different vibrations
are connected according to some unknown law, they are har-
monics only in exceptional cases. The second part of the
report considers the question whether a connection exi ts be-
tween the spectrum of a compound and the spectrum of the
elements which make up the compound. The investigations of
Dr. Gladstone are referred to, since confirmed in many instances,
in which he has shown that coloured acids, as chromic acid,
when combined with-different bases retain their own absorbing
properties. The same applies to coloured bases. But as Dr.

Gladstone himself points out, the law is by no means a general
one. The curious observations of Bnnsen's on the absorption-
spectra of didymium silts are discussed. Bunsen has shown
that their spectra are all very nearly alike, but slightly displaced
either towards one or towards the other end of the spectrum.
Capt. Abney and Col. Festing's observations on the absorption
in the infra-red are referred to at length, and the connection
between the luminous spectra of such bodies as the chlorides,
bromide-, and iodides of the alkaline earths is discussed. In

bodies is txjinted eu>, but no numerical connection has as yet
been found.

A deputation was appointed to present the memorial, but so
many other public bodies were approaching the Education De-
partment on the subject of the New Code, that Lord Spencer
was unable to find time to receive it, and the memorial was sent
in the usual way. Dr. Gladstone, however, as one of a deputa-
from from the London, Birmingham, and other School Boards
had an opportunity of urging the claims of science, and mention-
ing the special wishes of the British Association. Nothing
could be more distinct than the assurance of both Lord Spencer
and Mr. Mundella as to their desire to introduce the teaching of
Elementary Science as far as circumstances would permit.

erratic blocks is connected with the history of the giant glacier
which descended the Tees Valley, bringing, among other stones,
masses of the well-known Shap Fell granite. The boulders that
I have seen brought on shorehaving been trawled up by the
smack;are either of Shap granite or carboniferous limestone,
and of'.hese I have examined from sixty to seventy specimens.
The rough groundas far as I am awareextends from the
coast of Northumberland to the mouth of the Humber. While
the boulder clay on the coast line contains blocks of carboni-
ferous limestone and Sbap granite, the deposits of like date in
the valley of the Rye and Derwentsouth of the Cleveland
Moor districtare composed of oolitic and liassic detritus, and
are very different from those on the coast, though only a few
miles distant from each other.
tVanuickshire. A remarkable group of Erratic Boulders has
been exposed in some excavations made for building purposes in
Icknield Street, Birmingham, between Key Hill and Hockley
Hill. The section occurs on the north-west slope of the hill on
which it is exposed, and consists of 7 feet or 8 feet of glacial
drift (the height slightly varying at different points), which
immediately rests on an irregular and broken surface of the new

red sandstone of the district, and is composed of about I foot
6 inches of surface soil. The "drift" itself consists of erratic
blocks, intermixed with numerous round and oval stones and
pebbles, together with small gravel, sand and clay. In different
parts of the section these various materials occur in varying pro-
portions, a light clay gradually predominating. The erratic
blocks, however, so pervade the whole bed, and so thoroughly
constitute a component part of it, that they cannot have been
dragged into it, either singly or by twos and threes. They
must all have travelled together, for a certain distance, at any
rate, and have been brought down together to the spot at which
they are found.
The felsites and the felspathic ashes are the most abundant,
and the Llandovery sandstones are the rarest. No block of
granite has been found in this group of erratics.
Some are sub-angular; a not inconsiderable proportion are
well smoothed, although they can hardly be said to be highly
polished ; and on a few striae may be traced.
Prof. C. Lapworth has examined the specimens, and recog-
nises a large number as occurring in situ at the Berwyn Hills;
others may be found in the Areni<; range.
The condition of the new red sandstone rock on which the
boulders rest is most remarkable. The sandstone rock is broken
up, and large fragments of it have been lifted up nut of their
position and thrust into the middle of the drift. At one point

in the section a part of the rock has been lifted up almost like
an arm, and still remains united with the basement mass, while
the drift fills the L-shaped hollow. A large erratic block is
seen close to the extreme end of the uplifted arm of the base-
ment.
The evidence of violence is complete. The breaking up of
the sandstone rock, the uplifting of parts of it en masse, and the
Trying away of fragments, are facts as patent as the presence
'« erratic blocks themselves.

and Districts from these Formation.'. Drawn up by C. E. De
Ranee, Secretary.Eight years have elapsed since this Com-
mittee commenced to investigate the circulation of underground
waters, and the quantity and character of water supplied to
towns and districts so derived.
From 1874 to 187S the Triassic and Permian formations were
alone under consideration; in that year the Jurassic rocks were
added to the scope of the inquiry, which at the York meeting
was enlarged to include the whole of the permeable rocks in
England and Wales.
The Triassic and Permian rocks of Devonshire are de-cribed
in the first, fifth, and sixth reports; of Somersetshire in the
first ; of Leicestershire in the first, fourth, and fifth; of Warwick
in the second, fourth, and seventh ; of Nottingham in the second

In Devonshire the inquiry was carried on by Mr. Pengelly,
F.R.S., supplemented by details obtained by Mr. Stooke, C.E.
The Triassic rocks of the district have been made the object of
careful study by Mr. W. A. E. L'ssher. From his investigations
it would appear that the equence exhibited has more in common
with the Tr'as of the Fiench side of the English Channel than
with that of the midland counties. In Devon-hire and Somer-
setshire the sandstones and conglomerates appear to have been
deposited in a di-tirct basin to that north of the Mendips, the
Keuper marls being alone common to the two districts.
The basin south of the Mendips is remarkable for having a
series of marls intercalated in its sandstones, called by Mr.
Ussher the "Middle Marls"; ihese underlie sand-tones beneath
the Ktuper rr.arls. The conglomerates h.\ca distinctly local
character, and when present are plentifully water-bearing, as are
the sar.dstor.es, though to a somewhat less extent.
Private supplies are obtained by wells at Torquay, where the
water-level is 168 feet above the sea ; at Teignmouth; at Daw-
lish, where the water-level is 71 feet above the sea; and at
Bramford Speke, near Exeter.
Near Exeter the Lyons Holt spring issues at 126 feet above
sea-level, yielding towards the town supply 47,oco gallons
daily of very pure water, which is extensively used for drinking-
fountains.

Higher up the valley of the Exe and its tributaries private

North is the watershed separating the streams flowing into
English and Bristol Channels.
At Wellington a well 230 feet above the sea is sunk to a depth
of 4SJ feet; only a small quantity of water is pumped from it.
At Taunton numerous private wells give a supply of rather
hard water from the New Red Sandstone.
At Somerton hard water is obtained from a well 129^ feet
deep; the White Lias is said to occur in it at 90 to 99 feet.
At Wembdon a private well in triassic conglomerate yields
hard water at a well 30 feet deep, at 60 f. et ab ve the sea.
At Wookey, near Wells, 70 feet above the .-ea, .1 private well,
33 fett, yields a constant supply, uninfluerced by the seasons as
to quantity, tut dtcreases 9 feet in level after dry weather.
In Bristol the wells vary in depth from 60 to 300 feet, some
only penetrating peat and gravel, others passing through trias.-ic
marls, whilst a few penetrate the Coal-measures.

Owing to the accumula'i in of observations of height, weight,

Isles, the di cus^ion of which required the undivided attention
of the Anthropometric Committee, the acquisition of photo-

a C mmittee of the Anthropological Department.
The photographic portraits already collected have been handed
over to the new Committee, and will assist materially in deter-
mining the values of crosses in different parts of the country.
Some, obtained under exceptionally favourable circumstances,
and especially seventeen portraits of Shetland Islanders, well
illustrating the Scandinavian element in the population, and
presented by Dr. Muirhead, may be safely termed typical.

afford an opportunity of testing in a more c implete manner than

1'holographs of prisoners are taken solely in full face, and the

jection of the nasal bones in skulls from the round-barrows, as
measured from the basion to fixed points on the dorsum and the
nasion, or root of the nasal bones, is about twice that observed
in purely Teutonic crania. In the fine collection of true Saxon
skulls from Wiltshire, obtained by General Pitt-Rivers, the
principal characteristics are a rounded forehead and smooth
brow, and but little projection in the nasals; and this in the
male as well as the female skulls.
The points of contrast in the skeleton features of the two races
were noticed by Dr. B. Davis; but owing to Saxons and Angles
being at the time he wrote considered equally Teutonic, the
differences observed in some of the examples selected by him to
illustrate types, are not so srongly marked as in others. Dr.
lieddoe and Mr. David Mackintosh, it should be mentioned,
both consider the Anglian features to have been more prominent
than the Saxon.When proceeding to define tribal differences
and crosses, the nasal forms will, with other features, be sub-
jected by the Committee to more minute examination."
The above facts having been sufficiently ascertained, it was
easy to compare the skeleton features of the two main types
viz., the Round-barrow man and the Saxonwith profiles of

living subjects in this and neighbouring countries presumably
inhabited by similar populations. Whenever the osseous and
other features were found to correspond, at the same time that
they differed entirely from other equally well-marked types, it
was assumed that the characteristics belonged to distinct races.
In the following definitions the main types are designated by
capital letters, intended to be used as symbols when dicussing
racial crosses :
The First or Dolichocephalic Dark Type, A.The definition of
the short, narrow-headed race shown by Dr. Thurnam and Prof.
B. Dawkins to have preceded the so-called Celts, and termed by
them Iberian (= the Silurian of Prof. Rolleston), is at present
incomplete. The forehead, however, appears to have been fairly
vertical, the brows prominent, the nasal bones long and straight,
the lower jaw weak (Rolleston), and the hair and eyes dark.
Statistics of the colour of the hair and eyes, collected by Dr.
Beddoe, show that the race exerted a much w ider influence on
the population than is usually supposed. A number of photo-
graphs, which, it is believed, represent varieties of the type, have
been placed on cards.
The Second or Prachicephalic Fair Type, B.The principal
characteristics of this race consist in the prominence of brow
and supra-nasal ridges; a slightly receding forehead; sharply
projecting nasal bones, causing a high-br dged or arched nose,
without undulation; a long, oval face; high cheek-bones; and

a prominent fine chin. From Mr. Park Harrison's observations
the lips of this type appear to be thin, and the ear pear-shaped,
with no proper lobe, the fossa being continuous.
The above features are found associated with light hair and
eyes, and a stature above the average.
This type includes Belgic, Cymric, and Danish varieties,
which, further observation, the Committee believe, will by-and-
bye enable them to differentiate; cs also the Anglian, Jutish,
and Frisian types. They have selected several portraits, which
present common characteristics.
The definition of Type B agrees in all the main points with
descriptions given some years ago by Dr. Beddoe, Mr. David
Mackintosh, and Mr. Hector Maclean, as well as with Dr.
Rolleston's deductions in the appendix to " British Barrows."
The Third or Sub-Dolichocephalic Fair Type, C.The Com-
mittee believe that the following is a correct definition of true
Saxon features. Brows smooth ; forehead rounded and vertical;
nasal bones short and straight; nose not arched, ending in more
or less of a bulb; face elliptical, rounded; cheek-bones broad;
chin rounded; lower part of face wide; eyes prominent, in
colour blue or bluish grey; lips moulded; ears flat, with formed

Japan as travelling at 10,000 feet per second, decreasing as it
went on to 4500 feet, getting slower and slower as it
went on. The waves last from thirty seconds to four minutes.
The author describes the result of experiments carried out by
himself and Mr. Gray as to artificial earthquakes, explosions of
2 lbs. to 5 lbs, of dynamite in bore-holes 10 feet in depth, fired
by electricity, and the effect of letting a heavy iron ball fall on
the ground to a depth of 20 to 30 feet in height. The effect of
shocks is communicated along the surface, gradually decreasing as
it proceeded from the point of propagation, but at a less rate as
the distance increases.

intensity of the earth's magnetism or of coils of small radius and
many turns. This latter is difficult to evaluate, as it is im-
possible to measure the length of the wire wound, as the tension
necessary to make the wire lie evenly, stretches it very consider-
ably, whilst it is most important to determine the mean radius
accurately, as an error therein doubles itself in the final result.
The method of Kohlrausch is free from this objection, but it
requires a knowledge of the moment of inertia, a quantity not
easy accurately to determine. When the electromagnetic action
is a simple force, it can be determined directly. In Mascart's
recent determination, a large solenoid is suspended vertically
in a balance, and is actel on by a flat co-axal coil of much larger
radius. This is simple to think about, but not calculated to
secure precise results. The appearance of accuracy is illusory,
unless it can be assumed that the distribution of wire is abso-
lutely uniform. It would appear that all the turns of the sus-
pended coil should operate as much as possible, that is, that the
suspended coil should be compact, and should be placed in the
position of maximum effect. There is a further incidental advan-
tage in this arrangement. The expression for the attraction
involves as factors the product of the number of turns, the
square of the current, and a function of the mean radii of the
two coil-, and of the distance between their mean planes. This
function is of no dimen ions. When the position is such that
the function for two given coils is a maximum, the result is

practically dependent only on the two mean radii, and the func-
tion being of no dimensions, can involve these mean radii only
in the form of a ratio. This can be obtained electrically with
full precision by dividing a current between them in such a way
that no effect is produced on a small magnet at their common
centre. In practice it will be desirable to duplicate the fixed
coil, placing the suspended coil midway between two similar
fixed ones, through which the current passes in opposite direc-
tions.

fain of waves this was the velocity with which any given phase
of a wave moved forward ; this could easily be observed in the
case of waves on wa'er, bat in the case of light no wave form
could be observed. The velocity determined by Fizeau's method,
or by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, was not this, but the
velocity of propagation of intermissions of light, which if the
true velocity of propagation is a function of the wave-length, is
not the same as the true velocity; it is only the same where, as
in the case of air, the velocity of propagation is the same for all
wave-lengths. Foucault's method (Michelson's) is based on de-
termining the angular motion of a mirror between successive
reflections, which again is a different quantity from the former
two.
Sir W. Thomson wished to testify that the experiments were
made most carefully, and felt unable to suggest any other
explanation than Mr. Forbes's, but he felt trong previous objec-
tions to accepting it. He pointed out that Mr. Forbes's obser-
vations made the velocity of propagation smaller for waves of
shorter period, whilst from the analogy of sound in elastic bodies
we should expect the opposite.

On the Reversals of the Spectral Lines of Metals. By Profes-
sors Liveing, M.A., F.R.S.,and J. Dewar, M.A., F.R.S.The
authors have a twofold object in view in the study of this subject,
(1) to trace the parallel between the condition of the elements as
they exist in the sun and those in which they may be placed on
the earth; (2), that a knowledge of the reversible lines might
aid to distinguish those due directly to the vibrations of the
molecules and those produced by superposition of waves or by
some strain upon the molecules, such as the electric arc might
produce. They classify the reversals, as follows; (1) Reversals
produced when the expanded line itself forms the background
against which the absorption line is narrowed because the den-
sity is less than that of the emitted vapours. Th 'se are the one;
most generally known. (2) Reversals in which there is little or
no expansion of the lines, the background being either the hot
walls and end of the lube, the hot pole of the arc, or such part
of the spectrum which is so full of lines as to be nearly continuous.
Photographs exhibiting the reversals of the lines of iron and
o'.her metal-, were shown. (3) Reversals in which the back-
ground is produced by the expansion of a line of some other
metal. Photographs were shown in which the lines of iron and
other metals were seen reversed on the expanded lines of mag-
nesium. (4) Reversals produced by the introduction into the
crucible in which the arc was of a gentle current of hydrogen,

coal gas or ammonia, by which means the metallic lines were
almost swept away and the continuous spectrum increased. (5)
When a carbon tube passed through a perforation in a block of
lime is made the positive electrode of the arc, and a carbon rod
passed into another perforation so as to meet the tube in the
centre of the block, be made the negative electrode, the tube becomes gradually heated up, and in the direct line of the tube
the lines are seen bright, because there is no background, but are
seen reversed Jagainst the hot walls of the tube. Further the
effects of the gradual increasing temperature were traced, as the
tube was gradually heated. (6) A double reversal of lines is
occasionally ob erved, and an instance was shown, in which the
expansion of the magnesium lines between K and H, had taken
place to such an extent as to produce the reversal of the most
refrangible of the cyanogen bands; the magnesium producing a
broad absorption band again-t which the magnesium triplet stood
out bright and sharp. It is probable that this arises from the less
dense but intensely heated magnesium vapour beinj pushed for-
ward up the tube by the sudden burst of vapour produced when
a fre-h piece of metal is dropped into the arc.

Japan.By acting on monomercuric methylene iodide Hg(CH2)
I, (described in the Report of 1880) with mercuric chloride,
monomercuric methylene chloriodide HgCIIjOI is obtained.
This compound is acted upon by iodine, and yields mercuric
iodide and methylene chloriodide CHSIC1, which is a liquid
boiling at 1090 and having a specific gravity of 2*49 at 20°.
The formation of this latter substance shows that monomercuric

Attention is drawn to the fact that the boiling point of the
methylene chloriodide is approximately the mean of the boiling
points of methylene chloride and iodide.

but form and acetic acids are produced when chromic acid is
employed. Since isoprene can be converted into caoutchouc,
experiments have been made to ascertain whether this hydro-
carbon could be obtained from other sources, and inasmuch as
isoprene can be converted into a true turpentine, this latter
su stance was studied with this object. The author found that
when turpentine is passed through a red-hot tube a mixture of
hydrocarbons is obtained, from which a small quantity of a

has been isolated. The formula; assignable to the eight possible

pressure. It has also the temperature of the surrounding air, and

over water, or in pre ence of water, the serorthometer is charged

A Revision of the Atomic Weight of Rubidium, by Charles T.
Heyc<sk, B.A.The object of this revision is to ascertain
whether the atomic weight of rubidium can be brought into
accord with Prout's hypothesis. To this end pure chloride and
bromide of rubidium have been prepared, and the amount of
chlorine and bromine contained in these, determined by titrating
with silver nitrate in a manner identical with that employed by
Stas in his classical researches. The results obtained from
the chloriHe give an atomic weight of 85*344 for rubidium,

tuii decomposition, an observation which appears to destroy the
usual theories regarding the function of those metallic oxides,
which have a similar effect. It was supposed that the action of
the catalytic bodies might arise from a power to absorb oxygen,
but experiments made by placing black oxide of manganese under
conditions similar to those in which it aids the decomposition of
potassium chlorate, negatived this supposition. Gas retort
carbon can be completely burnt by contact with powdered
potassium chlorate at 340°, the action is not attended by fusion,
and it appears that in this case chemical affinity determines the
decomposition. The action of heat upon potassium chlorate
was studied by maintaining it at a constant temperature, and it
has been observed that the chlorate begins to give off its
oxygen between 330°3400, i.e. at temperatures much below its
fusing points. This decomposition goes on for several weeks and
finally becomes imperceptibly small, but a rise of temperature
or the addition of substances known to favour the decomposition,
produce a fresh decomposition leading to a further limit. The
authors propose a hypothesis to account for this gradual action
of heat upon the chlorate.

On the Cause of Elevation and Subsidence of Land, by J. S.
Gardner, F.G. S.The paper claims that the evidence of the
permanence of continents is inconclusive as regards eocene and
pre-eocene periods, and inquires what the shallower regions of
the Atlantic mean, if they do not mean a change of level at the
sea-bottom. Assuming with Sir C. Lyell, that at a given depth
rocks are molten, and that under further pressure they are re-
converted into solids of high specific gravity, the paper demon-
strates that the outer envelope is susceptible to and gives way
under any increased weight, and recovers when this is removed.
The evidence relied upon is that of coral isles, lava-flows, accu-
mulations of ice, and of sediment in deltas, estuaries, and along
sea-coasts. In these cases, unless there are counteracting agents,
subsidence invariably follows, and littoral seas are thus areas of
depression. The increasing pressure in deep oceanic basins acting
on the fluid layer leads to the elevation of lines of least resistance
into ridges or dryland, these Iin<"s generally coinciding with
coast-lines, and to volcanic outbursts. Geology demands pre-
eocene communication between many lands. The elevation of
land continuous between Europe and America in the north,
during the Middle Eocene, was coincident with a cessation in
the great formation of basalt, and its subsidence with a renewal
of this. The conclusion is drawn that irregularities of surface
have and will continue to become more and more accentuated.

boulders of Portsea Island, and stales that boulders of the same
character occur in the gravel of Portsea Island, two boulders of

The Southampton Artesian Well, by T. W. Shore and E.
Wesllake.The question is, whether it is possible by an exten-
sion of the existing well, to utilise it as a source of supply to the
town. The amount of water yielded by the well on the last
occasion of pumping, in 1851, was 130,000 gallons per day.
The quantity of water at present supplied to the town from the
Itchen is from 3 to 34 million gallons, but this is a much larger
quantity per head than is found to be sufficient for towns under
well regulated systems of supply. It thus appears that the well
yields about l-25th part of the quantity required. For the pur-
pose of increasing the yield, two methods are suggested: one of
them is to drive galleries or drift-ways in the chalk, the other is
to continue the boring through the chalk into the Upper and
Lower Greensands. The work of excavation was carried on
from July, 1838 till 1851, at a total cost of 19,000/., and reached
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
a total depth of 1317 feet. The diameter of the well was 13 feet,
d ininishing to 7 feet; it passed through 464 feet of the Tertiary
Beds, of which soil occupied 2 feet, Lower Bag-hot bed 74 feet,
304 feet of London clay, the latter consisting of sandy clay with
seams of water-bearing sand and pebble beds towards the too;
84 feet of Plastic Clay, with the usual bed of greensand on the
bottom. The chalk was reached at a depth of 464 feet, where
the masonry was terminated, but the 7-feet shaft was carried 99
feet into the chalk ; a 74 inch boring was then made with a "]\¦
inch augur to a further depth of 754 feet, making a total of 853
feet of chalk. The whole of the chalk contained flints, with the
exception of the last 10 feet. Most of the water met with
appears to have come from the chalk ; previous to the boring
being made, in 1842, 20,000 gallons was raised. In 1844 the
quantity rose to 50,000 gallons, and finally in September, 1851,
to 130,000. The chalk thus supplies 5-6ths of the whole
quantity. The authors then give a description of the Brighton
chalk wells, and they consider the conditions are similar at
Southampton. The authors, following the advice of Dr.

MilLtone-grit, yet he agreed with Mr. Eiheridge that the most

This water, on arriving at the Carboniferous Limestone, would
fl >w down the cracks, fissures, and joints, provided there were
such, but a comparatively small portion would filter through the

The author c m^idered that it was owing to this fact that we
generally find haematite where the Magnesian Conglomerate rests
upon the Carboniferous Limestone. The water being unable to
penetrate the roc';, would naturally find an outlet at the junction
of the two formations, an! by the wearing away of the rock the
conditions would soon be arrived at when the deposition of the
irm would take place.

NAVAL EDUCATION
FROM the papers and discussions which have recently
appeared in the yoiirnal of the United Service In-
stitution (Nos.cvi., cxv., 1880,1882), it would appear that a
large number of our naval officers are becoming sensible
of the many defects of the system under which their
younger brethren are at present entered and educated.
In all professions it is so much the custom of the seniors
of high rank to hold by the existing state of things, that
the protest now made is the more marked, coming, as it
does, not from one officer, or from a clique, but from
officers of all ages, ranks, and branches, who look on the
subject from different points of view, and correct their
judgment by different forms of experience. The fact
seems to be that, whereas the naval officer of former days
was not called on to be anything but a seaman, though it
was no doubt better if he was also a gunnerwhich was
but seldomat present he ought to be not only a seaman
and a gunner, but half-a-dozen other things as wella
navigator, an engineer, a mechanic, an electrician, some-
thing of a soldier, something of a naval architect, skilled

in signals and in tactics, and not ignorant of international
law. There are, of course, but few who can excel in all
these branches of knowledge; but every naval officer is
expected to know something of all, and before getting his
commission he has to show, in examination, that he does
know something of all, even though that something may
occasionally be very little: he is then permitted to choose
one or two subjects of which he may make a specialty;
he may devote himself to navigation, to gunnery, or to the
management of torpedoes; and on showing that he pos-
sesses special qualifications, he receives special appoint-
ments and a higher rate of pay. But whether his tastes
and abilities lead him to qualify in these special subjects
or not, he is supposed to have a certain respectable know-
ledge of all; and, as keeping up the traditions of the ser-
vice, he is required, before everything, to be a first-rate
seaman. The most important question then is, Does the
present system of training young officers ensure their be-
coming first-rate seamen? The answer of almost every
speaker at the United Service Institution is in the nega-
tive. Capt. Brine, to whom the Institution has this year
awarded its gold medal, says, "A midshipman serving in
an ironclad has but few opportunities of learning the
work of a sailor; it cannot be said that the years thus
passed are essentially valuable as regards seamanlike
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
training." Capt. Grenfell says, " We are all familiar with
Falconer's admirable picture of the almost child handling
a ship'And well the docile crew that skilful urchin
guides.' It would be useless to look for the same thing
now. Our urchins, we must confess, are not " skilful."
Capt. Cleveland says, "On board an ironclad, youngsters
have very little opportunity of learning more than just the
routine work, which they may learn from a book;" and
Lord Dalhousie thinks "the ordinary life of a midship-
man in a sea-going ship to be so ill-organised as to be
little better than very laborious waste of time, so far as
his own professional training and education are con-
cerned." Many others might be quoted to the same
Vol. xxvi.No. 672
effect, for the agreement is almost perfect; but these are
sufficient. It may be assumed as admitted that a little
boy sent on board an ironclad to learn seamanship, does
not learn it, and has no opportunity of learning it, whe-
ther seamanship is understood in the old sense of handling
a ship under sail, or in the modern sense of handling her
under steam, and still less if in the strictly logical sense

examination of their mothers or governesses, or the pre-
liminary schools they may have been at.'' Their general
education is then stopped; they are sent to the Britannia,
and there, in the space of two years, they have to learn
and pass an examination in a number of subjects, the list
of which is utterly appalling. On this Prof. Soley, of the
United States Naval College, says, "The course, as indi-
cated by the examination papers, is far in advance of the
mental powers of average boys of the prescribed age.
The reason that more do not fail is to be found in the low-
standard of passing, and in the system of cramming
carried out by clever tutors who are masters in the art of
coaching pupils for examinations. No one seems to pre-
tend that the students come anywhere near the ostensible
standard, or carry away anything like real knowledge of
the subjects embraced in the programme." And what
little is learnt is extremely evanescent : within six months
the majority have forgotten all about it. It appears from
a report by Dr. Hirst, the Director of Studies, that in a

system, which necessitates the "teaching mathematics
and navigation from the wrong end." In this, the In-
structors have no option; they are bound by an official
schedule which requires the newly-caught children, know-
ing next to nothing of Algebra or Geometry, and very
little of Arithmetic, to proceed at once to the solution of
Plane and Spherical Triangles. Of course the little fel-
lows learn to do these questions, because there is no
passing for them unless they do do them; but "the
knowledge is stuffed into them by a 'damnable itera-
tion' sickening alike to the teacher and the taught."
What is the result? We have shown that they pass out
of the Britannia and straightway forget it all. A Naval
Instructor of many years' experience assures us that his
guiding rule has been to assume that a youngster joining
his ship fresh from the Britannia knows nothing, and to
begin him with the very elements of Algebra and
Geometry. When this can be done, when the Naval
Instructor is zealous and is supported by the Captain,

when a suitable place can be found for study, and when
the youngsters are industrious and clever, then, no doubt,
very satisfactory results are sometimes obtained: but the
difficulties in the way are exceedingly great. "Order it
as you will," Mr. Laughton says, "on board ship the
routine will always interfere with the school, and inter-
ruptions are frequent. Nor does keeping the middle or
morning watch quicken a boy's faculties for study: with
his eyes involuntarily closing, his head nodding over his
book, the thermometer at 80° or 900, and the perspiration
dropping from the end of his nosethe difficulties in his
way are very real. What a make-believe school, under
such circumstances, often is, every Naval Instructor
knows very well. The wonder is not that, with such a
considerable expenditure of labour, so little is done, but
that anything is done at all." The present day affords an
example of another difficulty. What amount of school,
we would ask, have the young gentlemen of the Mediter-
ranean fleet done during the last three months? or, admitting that in some instances they have been present in the body, what amount of real study have they done? Our experience of boy-nature would lead us to answer None. And after all these difficulties, the end is as might be expected: for a young officer in his final examination to show any real knowledge of his theoretical subjects is said to be quite exceptional.
The result then of the present system is thatspeaking generallythe young officer, whilst a midshipman, learns neither the practical nor the theoretical parts of his profession: his time is muddled away: he gets a certain amount of crude knowledge crammed into him for L
examination; and having passed that, if all desire of learning has not been crushed out of him, he has too often to begin again at the very beginning. In the majority of cases, Mr. Laughton tells us, an officer coming to the College for a voluntary course of sh*

in the United States. A table of the numbers of these
fish which have been brought to market, being the yield
from the Potomac River only, shows that the catch in
fifteen years, namely, from 1866 to 1880, amounted to
10,621,444 individual fishes. The averages captured in
periods of five years were as follows :
Fir>t five years (1866-70) 870,109
Second ,, (1871-75) 874,114
Third  (1876-80) 380,065
ingle shad.
These figures are instructive. The shad fishery, as
demonstrated by the number of fish marketed at Alex-
andria and Washington, seems to have culminated in
1873, when the numbers offered for sale were 1,142,629
individual fish. After that year the supply begins to fall
off, till in 1878 the figures are reduced to 166,923 single
shad. The fluctuations of various years can be accounted
for in different ways to some extent, but as the Commis-
sioner says: "We must recognise in these statements
the inevitable result of successive years of over fishing;
of disturbing the fish on their spawning beds; and of

preventing them from reaching such beds." The ease
with which all kinds of fish can be treated pisciculturally
has been a really important discovery for the American
people, because there has begun all over the United States
a sensible, and in some instances a very marked, decline
in the supply of nearly all kinds of fish, even the salmon
in that great depository of these fine fish, the Columbia
Riverare diminishing in numbers, consequent upon the
incessant capture. It is gratifying therefore to learn from
the present report that there need be no bounds put to
the increase of our food fishes, and to be told that fishes
inhabiting the salt water exclusively can be as readily
propagated artificially, and increased to as unlimited an
extent as the " anadromous fishes," with whose spawn-
ing habits we are more thoroughly acquainted. We
have at home been accustomed to look with feelings of
wonder on the hatching of a hundred thousand salmon
eggs as if that were a sort of miracle, but the record of
the shad hatching operations given by Major T. B. Fer-
guson sinks into insignificance anything that has yet been
accomplished in the way of "pisciculture" in Great
Britain. In a period of some fifty days, upwards of
twenty million eggs of the shad were obtained, and over
eighteen millions of these eggs came to life as fish!
These young fish were all safely deposited in waters where

they had a good chance of growing to maturity and ulti-
mately contributing to the national commissariat. It
would seem to be a leading idea of those who have the
largest say in the regulation of the American fisheries
that it is better to multiply the fish by means of what is
known as pisciculture than to restrict in any way the
operations of the fishermen during the legitimate fishing
seasons; so long as the work of the pisciculturists can
keep pace with the work of the fishermen there can be
no objection to the occasional glutting of the markets
with such wholesome food.
We learn from a portion of Mr. Ferguson's report that
there are on the Atlantic Coast of the United States nine
fishes belonging to the herring tribe. Although no special
hatching station has yet been established for the propa-
gation of the Clupedia, it has been ascertained that like
other fish they can be operated upon "pisciculturally,"
and many hundred thousand eggs of these fish have been
hatched by way of experiment, the newly developed fry
being at once restored to the water. Some varieties of
this fish are of great commercial importance, and will

Although these two volumes cover a very wide field,

Mr. Coote does not profess to be much more than a

santly, and touched at a few places concerning which our
information is scanty, he may be held to have sufficient
excuse for bringing the record of his journey before the

the Banks and Torres Islands, the Santa Cruz and
Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Group. China and Japan, and Central and South America were
also embraced in his extensive tour. Mr. Coote is a good
observer, and the information he gives concerning what
he saw in the less frequented islands, the New Hebrides,
the Santa Cruz, Solomon and Loyalty Islands,is a welcome
addition to existing knowledge. He is chiefly interested in
the people, habits, houses, implements, and weapons,
and therefore the ethnologist may find something in his
volume that will be of service. The illustrations are
good, and the volume as a whole is extremely pleasant
reading.
Mr. Helms is an old traveller, and most of his volume
takes us back about thirty years ago. He spent consider-
able time in Bali and Borneo, where he took a prominent
part in the events connected with Rajah Brooke; visited
Cambodia and Siam, China and Japan, and spent some
little time in California during the height of the gold fever.
He brings together much curious and interesting informa-
tion about Bali and Borneo, especially at the time of his
sojourn, the condition of the people, their manners and
customs, the state of trade, &c. He gives a very vivid
description of an instance of suttee which he witnessed.
His account of what he saw in California is interesting,

daughter-granules are separated by the growth itself and by
accident, and the division is determined by the dilaceration of
the threads. The young granules increase in size, and acquire
their normal figure. After the division, there may be found
upon the granules a few protoplasmatic hyalin cilia, divided in
groups. These cilia are the remainder of the divisional threads.
All these cilia spring from points where dark spots are seen upon
the surface of the living granules. The compressed granules of
Hartwegia, of Fem-Prothallia, of Vallisneria, and Elodea offer
most favourable opportunities for ascertaining the manner of
division. This singular process is repeated again and again, so
that the older granules are compressed, and a filament is formed,
which elongates more and more rapidly as the granules increase
in number. Sometimes the filament may be ramified. This
continued multiplication by division h-.s its limits; the proto-
plasmatic bearer ((he matter of the granule, which carries the
colouring substance) changes its appearance, and contains starch-
granules, which soon become numerous. The whole process
cannot, of course, be seen in the same granule, but in some,
dividing granules may be observed in one stage, and in others
in another. In such a manner (though the process is not so

clear) divides the endochrome of the Bacillariaceae, as I have
studied it, in Himantidium pectinate. That is the manner
of division certainly most common. The second mode of
multiplication by division is more simple. The granules are
divided by a constriction, and separate into single granules; the
daughter-granules become detached after they have reached their
full form and size. No cilia or threads, only a small number
two to three (not six to eight) are formed by the division in the
isthmus between the half-granules. This division is a reduced
form of the former, that is, the direct division without cilia ; the
former is the indirect division with cilia. The direct division I
have studied in all higher and lower green plants in all seasons of
the year. The second form, the direct division, is seen especially
in the cells of Vaucheriaand Chara. These changes in the division
of chlorophyll-granules of which we speak, can only be observed
w ith a considerable magnifying power (2000-3000 lin. mag.),
that is the cause why Mikosch agrees with the other authors men-
tioned in disclaiming the notion of threads of the true mode of
division. I ascertained these changes in March of the year 1880,
and described them in a short notice in the Magyar Ndvinytani

nearly completed before the troubled state of the country

part of the world, we were unable to start until ten o'clock.
Partly on that account, and partly because snow had
fallen during the night towards the summit of the pass,

100 fathoms in the Hardanger Fjord (about five miles
from Lervik haven), that very remarkable Pol>zoan
mollusc, Rhabdopleura. Mr. Norman originally dis-
covered this organism off the Shetlands, and it has since
been described from specimens observed in the Lofoten

complete account of it than had been possible for Frof.

advantage of the company of Mr. Norman, whose know-
ledge of dredging operations and of the northern marine
fauna is unrivalled. My object has been to make a
further study of Rhabdopleura upon fresh and living
examples, and in this I have been successful. At first
we found Rhabdopleura only at great depths attached to
recently dead pieces of the beautiful coral, Lophohelia
prolifcra. But subsequently we have been able to dredge
it and bring it in for study within an hour, having dis-
covered it in water of only 25 fathoms depth at the
mouth of the harbour where it occurs in the form of
creeping colonies upon Ascidia mentula, and on dead
shells. A body-cavity, tentacular skeleton, male repro-
ductive organs, and various facts as to the mode of
growth, gemination, and development of the polypides,
are the new features which these specimens have so far
brought to light, whilst they have also served to confirm

SCIENTIFICREsbLTS OF THE "JEANNETTE"
EXPEDITION
THE last number (August 26) of Der Naturforscher
contains a first attempt to lay down the scientific
results of this expedition, in a paper by Herr H. Wich-
mann, based on the reports of Messrs. Melville and
Danenhauer, and of the naturalist of the expedition, Mr.
Newcomb. It is known that after having passel, on
August 31, the wintering station of the Vega, the Jeannette
sailed north, towards Wrangel's Land. But on September
5, when twenty miles north-east of Herald Island, she
was frozen in, and during twenty-one months remained
so, "the play of winds and currents." However drifted

in different directions, she still advanced during all this
time towards the north-west. The first wintering was
north of Wrangel Land, which last proved to be a large
island, and not a part of an Arctic continent as had been
presumed. The precious observations on aurora; and
magnetism which were made during the winter (about
2000 measurements) are unhappily lost, as well as exten-
sive collections of birds and of deep-sea fauna. The
depth of the ocean in these regions was everywhere very
smallthirty fathoms on an average, with a maximum of
sixty and a minimum of seventeen fathoms. The bottom
was usually a blue ooze, with a few shells and sometimes
stones, which seemed to be of meteoric origin.
The ship still drifted towards the north-west, and on
May 17 a small island, called Jeannette Island, was
sighted in 760 47' 28" N. lat. and 159° 20' 45" E, long. It
was a rocky hill, covered with snow, situated on the
eastern flank of a high mountain. Two days later
another island was discovered towards the west, and an
expedition under Mr. Melville reached it, with many
difficulties, and landed on it on June 3, 1881. It was
called Henrietta Island, and is situated under 770 8' N.
lat. and 157° 43' E. long. ; it is rocky, and 2500 to 3000
feet high; the rocks are covered with nests of birds, but
the vegetation is very poor, consisting of lichens and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
mosses, and of one species of phanerogam; all the island
was covered with a sheet of ice and snow 50 to 100 feet
thick, and a mighty glacier reached the sea on the north
coast. As is known, on June 13, under 77° 30* N. lat.,
and 155° E. long., the Jeannette was lost, the depth of
the sea being there 38 fathoms. The crew, divided in
three parties, went south, but ten days later they per-
ceived that, owing to the drift of the ice, they had still
advanced 27 miles north-west, being under 770 42' N. lat.
That was the highest latitude reached by the expedition.
On July 9 they perceived land, and after a hard journey,
reached it at a promontory they called Cape Emma (76°
38' N. lat., 1480 20' E. lat.). This island, which received
the name of Bennett, is a high mass of basalt, covered
with glaciers; the island was crossed by a party,
after two days' travel, and the north coast proved
to be more hospitable than the south; it has several
valleys covered with grass, where reindeer bones and
drift-wood were found; lignite was discovered on the
south coast, aud it is said that it would be quite useful
for steamers. Dr. Ambler here collected fossils, as well

and all the necessary arrangements for the piscicultural depart-
ment. Since the date of the last meeting the Committee have
received highly encouraging notices of adhesion from several
additional governments and colonies, one of the latest received
being a highly satisfactory telegram, through the Foreign Office,
from the Imperial Government of China. From several parts of
France also the process of oyster cultivation, carried to great
perfection in that country, will be well represented; and the
exhibits promised from Hungary, Italy, and Germany, are such
as the Committee feel will be in the highest degree interesting,
whilst from Norway and Sweden, the Netherlands, and other
countries, including the Chilian Republic, which enjoy the
advantage of local committees sanctioned by the governments,
the collective exhibits sent will of course approach perfection.
The International Meteorological Committee, who recently held
their Annual Conference at Copenhagen, agreed to forward to
the Exhibition from their respective countries representa1 ions of
the system of forecasting the weather. From the colonics, for
the most part, very satisfactory replies have been received, and
official arrangements have been organised in nearly all the
colonies connected in any way with the fishing interest. In the
list of special prizes the Committee have made large and im-

For example, among the rare earths, glucina, zirconia, &c, lithium occurs in our lithia micas, and spodumene containing from 5 to 8 per cent, of lithia, occurs by the ton in at least one locality. Among rare metals which form metallic acids, columbium, the first

If trained mineralogists would oftener go into the field, and if wealthy amateurs would aid in exploring American localities as freely as they engage in importing costly specimens from Europe, they would do much to foster science. In the afternoon of Wednesday the introductory addresses were given by heads of the nine sections into which of late the Association has been divided. The address in the Mathematical and Astronomical Section was read for its author, Prof. Harkness, of the Naval Observatory, on the Transits of Venus. It was an historical and, to a moderate extent, a critical review of what has been hitherto done in the observations of such transits, with particular reference to the results attained in 1874 and to those which are to be expected in
i88z. Dr. H. C. Bolton, of Trinity College, gave a review of the recent work of the Chemical Section, and then took for his theme the history of chemical literature, especially in its early aspects. In physics the speaker was Prof. Mendenhall, of Columbus, O., who was formerly in Japan, and he made an address on the methods to be pursued in teaching physics in colleges. Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, of Columbia College, in the Section of Mechanics, made a strong plea for the promotion of experiments in mechanics, in close connection with theoretical studies. He dwelt upon the extraordinary demands now made by the public on engineers, and gave many illustrations of what experiment has done, and instances of what it may do in the future, to determine problems of profound importance In the
I'i logical Sec ion, Dr. W. H. Dall, of Washington, give an
account of what has been accomplished in this country towards a knowledge of the biology of the molluscs. In the related Section of Histology and Microscopy Prof. Tuttle, of Columbus, O., questioned the propriety of a special microscopical section, and in the section last to be named, the Anthropological, a paper by Dr. Daniel Wilson, of Montreal, was read on some of the physical characteristics of certain native tribes in Canada. In the Physical Section the mo t remarkable paper was that of Prof. Rowland, describing the new gratings which he has made at the Johns Hopkins University for the study of the solar spectrum. He exhibited the resul's obtained by these gratings in photographs of the spectrum, which, it is stated, far surpass any that have hitherto been mide. The generous and infirmal
hospitality of Montreal received grateful recognition on all sdes.
Excursions had been arranged to Ottowa and Quebec, private
houses* were freely opened to guests; the Local Committee on one evening, Principal Dawson on another, and the Art
A-sociation on a third, offered evening entertainments. Public lectures were promised by Dr. Carpenter on Deep-Sea Soundings, and by Prof. A. Melville Bell on Visible Speech. The number of persons enrolled as in attendance was more than eight hundred.
It is stated that the curiosities and other articles brought home
in the screw survey ship Alert, Capt. Maclear, now lying at

Definitive Comet-orbits.1. The fourth comet of 1874
(Coggia, April 17). Dr. Hepperger, of Vienna, has investi-
gated the orbit of this comet from the whole extent of observa-
tion, founding his work upon 17 normals from 638 observed
positions. He finds the orbit an ellipse with period of 13,708
years, and con-iders that his results exclude equally a parabola
and any ellipse with a revolution shorter than 8000 years. The
aphelion distance is 1144'°. (the earth's mean distance from the
sun being taken as unity), at the descending node the radius-
vector is 0'7I7, near the orbit of Venus, and at ascending node
it is 11734. Coggia's comet became visible to the naked eye
at the beginning of June, and so continued until it was lost in
these latitudes in the middle of July, when the tail had gradually
increased to 23°.

[Sept. 14, 188:The most remarkable feature of the internal surface is, that it
possesses the excitable hairs, three on each side, which in Diontca
are the starting-points of the excitatory process whenever it is
stimulated by touch, as is normally the case when the leaf is
visited by insects; for experiment shows that although the
whole of the leaf can be excited either by pressure or by the
passage of an induction current, the hairs exclusively are excited
by touch. It is therefore of great interest to know their struc-
ture and their relation to the excitable cells of the parenchyma,
with which they are in so remarkable a relation physiologically.
In sections such as that which we will now project on the screen
(Fig. 6), it is seen that each hair springs from a cushion which con-
sists of minute nucleated cells inclosed by epidermis; audita:
we follow this structure into the depth of the leaf, its central au

those of the ordinary parenchyma of the leaf. By these at
must be admitted that the endowment of excitability is posse*
in a higher degree than by the ordinary cells of the pireoca..-
so that for a moment one is tempted to assign to them tunc..
corresponding to those of motor centres in animal strata
(particularly in the heart). There is, however, no reason for Mb

internal surface of the lobe, suggests that although the paren-
chyma of the inside has apparently the same structure, it has
not the same function as that of the outsidethat is, that
although the cells of the outer layers are just like those of the
inner, they are either not excitable at all, or are so in a much
less degree. In this way only can we account for the bending
inwards of the lobe. In the unexcited state both layers are
equally turgid; as the effect of excitation the internal layers
become limp, the external remaining tense and distended.
I will now endeavour to illustrate the motions of the leaf
by projecting them on the screen. Here are several leaves
which have been prepared by attaching one of the lobes to a
cork support; the other is free, but a very small concave mirror
has been attached to its external surface near the margin.

NATURE
in view is to demonstrate the contrast between the motion of the
leaf and muscular contraction. A muscle in contracting acts as
one organat once. The motion of the leaf is the result of the
action of many hundred independent cells, all of which may act
together, but may not. In either case they take a great deal
longer to think about it; for during a period after excitation,
which amounts at ordinary summer temperature to about a
second, the leaf remains absolutely motionless.
And now we have to inquire what happens during this period
of delay. There are two things which we may assume as certain
without further proof, namely, first that something happens;
for when I see a certain movement followed after a time in-
variably by another, I am quite sure that the chain between
cause and effect is a continuous one, although the links may be
invisible; and secondly, that this invisible change has its seat in
the protoplasm of each of the excitable cells.
We have already seen that in muscle this latent state of excita-
tion is not withhout its concomitant signthe excitatory electri-
cal disturbance, and I have now to show you that this, which is
the sole physical characteristic of the excitatory process in animal
tissues, manifests itself with equal constancy and under the same

conditions in plants.
It will be unnecessary for my present purpose to enter into
any details as to the nature of the electrical change; it will be
sufficient to demonstrate with respect to it, first, that when
observed under normal physiological conditions, its phenomena
are always conformable to certain easily defined characters;
secondly, that it culminates before any mechanical effect of
excitation is observable, and consequently occupies, for the most
part, the period of latent excitation already referred to; and
thirdly, that it is transmitted with extreme rapidity from one
lobe of the leaf to the opposite. Of these three propositions, it
will be convenient to begin with the second. On the left-hand
screen is projected the mercurial column of the capillary electro-
meter of Lippmann. The instrument which we use this evening
is one of great sensibility, given me by my friend Prof. Loven of
Stockholm. The capillary electrometer possesses a property
which for our purpose is invaluablethat of responding instan-
taneously to electrical changes of extremely short duration. We
cannot better illustrate this than by connecting the wires of the
telephone with its terminals. If I press in the telephone plate
I produce an instantaneous difference between the terminals in
one direction, and in the opposite when I remove the pressure.
You see how beautifully the mercurial column responds.
We now proceed to connect the terminals with the opposite
sides of a leaf, so that by means of the mirror we can observe
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the moments at which the leaf begins to close and the first move-
ment of the mercuriil column, both being projected on the same
screen. We shall see that the mercurial column responds (so to
speak) long before the mirror. The difference of time will be
about a second.
We now take another leaf which, with the plants of which it
forms part, is contained in this little stove, at a temperature of
about 32° C. Our object being to subject the leaf to a succes-
sion of excitations, the effects of which would of course be to
determine its closure, we prevent this by placing a little beam of
dry wood across it, and fixing the ends of the beam with plaster
of Paris to the marginal hairs of each lobe. At the same time,

moving at a uniformly rapid rate taking the | lace of the rcreen,
and you have as the result the photograph (Fig. 10) which I show.
Here are the electrical (ffects of several successive excitations re-
corded by light with unerring exactitude. In each, the diphasic
character is distinct, and you see that the first or negative 1 hase
lasts less than a second, but that the positive, of which the extent is
much less, is so prolonged that before it has had time to subside
it is cut off by another excitation.
It would have been gratifying to me, had it been possible, to
exhibit to you other interesting facts relating to the excita-
tory process in our leaf. It has, I trust, been made clear to
you that the mechanism of plant motion is entirely differetit
from that of animal motion. But obvious and well marked as
this difference is, it is nevertheless not essential, for it depends
not on 1 ifference of quality between the fundamental chemical
processes of plant and animal protoplasm, but merely on dif-
ference of rate or intensity. Both in the plant and in the
animal, work springs out of the chemical tran formation of
material, but in the plant the process is relatively so slow that it
must necessarily store up energy, not in the form of chemical

compounds capable of producing work by their disintegration,
nut in the mechanical tension of elastic membranes. The plant
cell uses its material continually in tightening springs which it
has the power of letting off at any required moment by virtue of
ibat wonderful property of excitability which we have been
studying this evening. Animal contractile protoplasm, and par-
ticularly that of muscle, does work only when required, and in
doing so, uses its material directly. That this difference, great
»s it is, is not essential, we may learn further from the consi-
deration that in those slow motions of the grow ing parts of plants
wbich form the subject of Mr. Darwin's book, "On the Move-
ments of Plants," there is no such storage of energy in tension of
elastic membrane, there being plenty of time for the immediate
transformation of chemical into n echanical work.
I have now concluded all thai I have to say about the way in
which plants and animals respoid to external influences. In
this evening's lecture >ou have seen exemi lifted the general fact,
applicable alike to the physiology of plant and anin al, that
whatever knowledge we possess has been gained by experiment.
In speaking of Mimosa, I might have entertained )ou with the
ingenious conjectures which were formed as to its mechanism at
a time when it was thought that we could arrive at knowledge
l.y reasoning backwardsthat is, by inferring from the struc-
ture ol living mechanism what its function is likely to be. In
certain branches of physiology something has been learnt by

this plan, but as regards our present investigation, almost noth-
ing, nor indeed could anything have been learnt. Everywhere
we find that nature's means are adapted to her ends, and the
more perfectly, the better we know them. But, with rare
exceptions, knowledge is got only by actually seeing her at work,
for which purpose, if, as constantly happens, she uses conceal-
ment, we must tear off the veil, as you have seen this evening,
by force. Have we the right to assume this aggressive attitude?
Ought we not rather to maintain one of reverent contemplation
«aiting till the truth comes to us?
I will not attempt to answer this question, for no thoughtful
person ever asked it in earnest. Ano'her question lies behind
it, which is a deeper and a much older one. Is it worth while?
Is the knowledge we seek worth having when we have got it?
Notwithstanding that so recently even those who are least con-
versant with our work have been compelled to acknowledge the
beauty and completeness of a life devoted to biological studies,
still the question is pressed upon us every hourHow can you
think of spending days in striving to unravel the mechanism of a

pores projecting as in Terebellaria, but that this character is ob-
servable only in well-preserved specimens. When the prominent

examined, it will be seen that the cells are peculiarly arranged,
beautifully punctured, with an orifice sometimes circular, at other
times semi circular, and some'imes the cell characters of portions
of the colony bear a resemblance to Bidiastopora ramosissima of

the whole of the fol aceous for.ns of the Jurassic period in one

he has done in his two papers on the Diastoporidae, keeping
the foliaceous types for distinct study. At the same time he is
willing to admit that in getting rid of one difficulty in our
grouping we open the door to admit others. Haime admits both
the encrusting and foliaceous types, accepting the genus Bereniaa

form species. Prof. Braun, in his Jurassic studies, separates the
species Diastopora foliacea from the group, and establishes
another, which he calls Elea, claiming for his type certain
peculiarities which have been entirely overlooked by authors. It
is very certain that the more closely we examine Jurassic Polyzoa
and compare them with modern speciesof the genus Diastopora, the
more divergent the types appear; and although we would rather
accept a simple than an elaborate classification, still there are
limits beyond which it is not wise to go.

Report of the Committee on Electrical Standards.Mr. Taylor
had been engaged during the past year in determining the effect
of the annealing of wires on the temperature co-efficient of their
resistance. The experiments were not yet concluded, but so far
they had shown that the effect of annealing was enormous, in
some cases altering the temperature co-efficient by as much as
50 per cent. The Committee hoped that Lord Rayleigh would
arrange a system for testing resistances at the Cavendish Labo-
ratory. In connection with this report Lord Rayleigh made some
remarks On making Standard Resistance Coils equal to Multiples
o/ari Original Unit Coil. The usual method is to make a copy
of the unit coil; by combining these, a coil of two units can be
made, then of four, five, and so on. By this means the errors
would accumulate. The method he proposed was simpler than
this. Three coils each of three units resistance, placed in
multiple arc, are equivalent to one unit, whilst in series the
resistance amounts to nine units. This, with the addition of the
original unit, makes a resistance of ten units. The observations
should be made quickly after one another, and he explained an
arrangement of mercury cups by which this was effected with
rapidity.

Report of the Committee on Meteoric Dust, by Prof. Schuster.
The report referred to the work of M. Tissandier, who has
found magnetic particles of iron in the dust gradually settling
down in dry weather, or precipitated by rain or snow. These
particles are of various shapes, but the most remarkable form is
a spherical one, which conveys the obvious information that the
particles at one time must have been in a state of fusion. These
have been fcund in the snows on the slopes of Mont Blanc, at a
height of nearly 9000 feet, in the sediment of rain collected at
the observatory of Sainte Marie du Mont, and in the dust col-
lected at different elevated positions. For an explanation of
these magnetic spherules we are reduced to three alternatives.
The particles may be of volcanic origin, they may have been
fused in our terrestrial fires, or they may be meteoric. All the
volcanic dust which the author has had at his disposal was care-
fully examined under the microscope, but its appearance was
found to be altogether different from the supposed meteoric dust.
Such also seems to be the conclusion arrived at by Tissandier.
No iron spherules to the author's knowledge have been found in
volcanic dust. The smoke issuing from the chimneys of our
manufacturing towns contains iron particles similar in appear-
ance to those to which Tissandier ascribes a meteoric origin.
That some of these particles are found very far from any terres-
trial sources which can produce them, would not perhaps tell
conclusively against their terrestrial origin, but chemical analysis
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
seems to settle the point. The iron particles issuing from our
chimneys contain neither nickel nor cobalt, while these metals
were found by Tissandier to exist in the microscopic magnetic
particles found in rain-water collected at the observatory of
Sainte Marie du Mont. We are, therefore, driven to ascribe
1 cosmic origin of these particles. During the last year the
author has examined microscopically small iron particles
from [the sand near the great pyramids, from the desert of
Rajpootana, and from the Nile mud near the village of
Sohag. The sand from the pyramids contains an appreciable
quantity of magnetic particles. The great part of these particles
are angular, and doubtless are due to the dibris of magnetic
rocks; but here and there spheres are found exactly like tho-e
described by Tissandier, and about the same diameter, that is
o'2 to O'l mm. The Rajpootana sands are not yet completely
investigated, but as yet there has been no appearance of metallic
iron. The author then passes on to consider the aUbris left
behind in our atmosphere by the passage through it of shooting-
stars. Tissandier has examined the dust found on meteors, and
has found that it resembles in appearance the magnetic particles
found in other places. The question arises, how is it that the

Now there is I think preliminary evidence to show that both kinds
of weather are due very greatly, if not altogether, to changes in
the sun, a large declination-range, and a large temperature-
range denoting an increase of solar power. There is also
evidence that temperature-range weather once produced travels
from west to east, taking probably on an average eight or nine
days to cross the Atlantic.
There is also, I think, preliminary evidence that declination-
range weather travels likewise from west to east, but quicker
than temperature range weather, taking about two days to cross
the Atlantic.
Now if this be true it might be expected that the declination-
i.inge weather of to-day should be found similar to the
temperature-range weather six or seven days afterwards, so that
by a study of the declination-range weather of to-day, we should
be able with a certain measure of success to predict the
temperature-range weather six or seven days afterwards.
I have here given the train of thought which led to this
investigation, but, I ought to say that the results obtained do not
depend upon the exact truth of every step of this train of
reasoning.

This is in reality a matter of fact investigation undertaken
with the view of ascertaining whether or not there is any re-
cognisable connexion between these two weathers in Great
Britain. The result obtained I may add was reported to the
Solar Physics Committee, and by them communicated to the
Royal Society.
In order to avoid as much as possible the influence of locality,
I obtained through the kindness of the Meteorological Council
the diurnal temperature ranges at Stonyhurst, Kew, and Falmouth
for the years 1871 and 1872. I obtained likewise through the
kindness of the Kew Committee, the diurnal ranges of magnetic
declination at the Kew Observatory for the same two years,
excluding disturbed observations. The temperature ranges dis-
cussed are therefore the means of those at the three observatoiies
above mentioned, and still further to tone down or equalize
individual fluctuations, the daily numbers exhibited are each the
.sum of four daily ranges the two before and the two after.
Finally the object being to represent fluctuations of range rather
than their absolute values, a daily series representing the mean
of twenty-five daily numbers has been obtained. Each daily
number is thus compared with the mean of twenty-five daily
numbers both columns being symmetrically plactd with regard to
time and the differences whether positive or negative between the
two columns is taken to represent temperature-range fluctuations. A precisely similar course has been taken »ith respect to the
Kew declination ranges.
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
By this means two years of daily numbers, sometimes positive
and sometimes negative, representing temperature range weather,
and two years of daily numbers sometimes positive and some-
times negative representing declination range weather, have
been obtained. The next object is to compare the two series
with one another.
Now when two series of waves representing elevations and
depressions come together it is well known that we shall have
the greatest result when the crests of the one series coincide with
the crests of the other, and the smallest result, perhaps even
none at all, when the crests of the one series coincide with the
hollows of the other. This indeed is the well known explanation
of musical beats.
Now if there be any marked likeness between the two weathers
and if it be true that declination-range weather precedes tempera-
ture weather by six or seven days, the algebraic sum of the two
sets of fluctuations representing these weathers will be greatest
when the declination is pushed forward in point of time so that
the declination fluctuations of to-day shall be summed up with
the temperature fluctuation six or seven days after.

Contact Makers of Delicate Action, by Prof. H. S. Hele Shaw.
The author has been engaged in designing a speed indicator
in which it is essential to have the uniform motion of a revolving
disk. This disk is subject to varying resistance, so that for
driving it, clockwork, even though powerful and expensive,
conld scarcely be depended upon. It therefore seemed best to
employ an electro-magnet acting on a ratchet wheel and con-
trolled by a clock. This clock for the purpose might then be a
common one, with lever escapement. Upon enquiry there ap-
peared to be no contact maker at once, absolutely reliable,
suitable for continuous use, and at the same time sufficiently
delicate in its action.
In an instrument of this kind for completing circuit it is
necessary to ensure such a close approach of the surfaces forming
the opposite p lies as practically amounts to absolute contact.
With small differences of potential and without previous contact,
the exact distances across which the current will flow appears to
be at present unknown. According to Prof. Guthrie the terminals
of 50 or 60 grove cells may be brought to within i-ioooth of an
inch without any indication of the passage of a current. Prof.
Tyndall says that a battery of more than 1000 cells is required

Thompson mentions I-I0,oooth of an inch as the di-tance. T:.
ascertain the quantity exactly, appears impossible without these
of an instrument of such refinement as Whitworth's millionth
measuring machine, a modification of which might be ver,
appropriately employed for the purpose. The distance nodooit
is extremely small, and the con-eqnent difficulty in the way c*
ensuring electrical contact when the opposite poles are the s=r
faces of two solids, seems to merit a brief consideration.
The ways in which two such surfaces are brought together nsr
for convenience be divided into (1) a relative motion of the rw
terminal surfaces, normal to both ; (2) a motion tangential to
both; (3) a motion compounded of these two. The first mode
is very common with rapid contact makers, such for instance of
those with electric bells and telegraphic transmitters, brat these
require an appreciable amount of force to work them. That
contact makers of this kind are not suitable with delicate clocki
is the testimony of every clockmaker to whom the author h*
spoken One of these instruments of very delicate constructi>o
required the weight of nearly one gram to ensure electrical
contact, and then could not be entirely relied upon. There is
no doubt that when two surfaces of solids touch only lightly tie
area of contact is exceedingly small. This area may be made

to increase by increasing the pressure with which they are brought
into contact. The conditions of the problem under consideration
do not admit of this being done to any appreciable extent.
Thus-, even when chemical compounds are prevented from
forming on the surfaces, dust and particles floating in the air
are liable to become deposited between them, and render contact
uncertain.
For these reasons contact of the second kind which is known
as rubbing or sliding contact has been largely adopted. This
action may be made perfectly reliable, and is suitable where the
motion is not rapid as for instance with switches and com-
mutators. But considerable energy may be absorbed in over-
coming friction. Those clockmakers who employ it, appear to
do so only for large clocks. The third method has, as far as the
author is aware, been adopted in only one way, though in that
way with eminent success. A contact maker of this kind is used
by Mr. Hargreaves of Leeds, who has had it at work for fifteen
years. A metal roller with rounded edge runs upon and between
two metal rails of circular section, thus making contact between
them. Contact is broken when the roller passes over a gap or

It theie makes contact between the mercury below, and a smaller
quantity in an insulated capsule within the tube. '1 he lever is
worked from the outside by mere contact with the escapement
wheel of an ordinary clock, w hich ow ing to its extreme sensitive-
ness is quite sufficient to do this. The positive and negative
poles of the terminals are connected respectively with the
mercury in the capsule and that in the vessel. It is evident that
although the lever is always in electrical contact with the mercury
in the vessel, the circuit is only completed when it is brought into
contact with that in the capsule.
Varir us experiments have been made with this in-trument, and
the result has been completely salisfactory. With a battery of
fifteen Grove cells the surface of the mercury was brighter at the
end of half an hour than at the beginning of the experiment,
although a much more brilliant spark was visible than when
eontact was made in air. After three weeks of intermittent
working for 1 eriods of sometimrs as much as twelve hours but
with weaker batteries, the mercury remained quiie clean.

1. Con'act is made and broken at F instead of at I), thus pre-

The lever and balance weights, \v w, are made to go within the
lid which can be taken off the bottom and screwed on to the top

Howes.The author regards a fene-tra (long known to exist) in
the roof of the auditory capsule of the genus and its adjacent
parts, to be a modification of what is seen in other species,
which is correlative of the compression from above downwards
undergone by it, resulting in the formation of a tympanum
physiologically foreshadowing the essential process involved in
the elaboration of the auditory organ of the higher forms.
Prof. H. N. Martin, D.Sc, explained briefly his method of
isolating the mamalian heart for experimental purposes.
Dogs were u ed: these being etherised, were then kept alive
by artificial respiration; all systemic vessels, with the exception
of the thoracic aorta and the superior cava were then ligatured.
The heart is now supplied by defibrinated dog's or calf's blood
by means of a Harriot's flask, the whole animal being kept in a
moist and warmed chamber. Dr. Martin by these means has
found that either the venous or aortic pressure may be varied in
very great limits without the rate of the beat being altered, but
by increasing the venous pressure very slightly, the work done
by the organ was vastly increased. These researches are, how-
ever, only preliminary.

feature in ibis proposal is that of driving the chalk catting
machinery by hydraulic power, the waste water being discharged
into a vessel with the chalk debris. Chalk "cream," is then
formed by the revolution of a drum in this vessel, and this cream
is pumped to the head of the working and di-charged.
Three papers were read by Major Allen Cunningham R.E.,
whose recently published woik in connection wi h the Hydraulic
Experiments at Roorkee, gives this country a position with
regard to the subject, which it certainly could not previously
claim. The following are brief exracts:On unsteady Motion in
Open Channels: The motion of water in open channels is
essentially an unsteady motion with intirlacing streamlines;
the hypothesis of steady parallel motion is at variance with
nature. Single velocity measurements are of little practical use,
being only accidental values; the average of a large number is
pretty constant, so that the average velocity should always be
sought. The time needed 10 obtain these involves a chance of
change of the external conditions. In practical hydraulics the
forward velocity is the only velocity considered or required.
Floats measure this directly; no other instruments yield this
quantity readily in large streams. Thee principles are of great

importance, and show that hydraulic experiments must always
be tedious and expensive. Convexity of the Suiface of Streams:
The figure of the transverse section of the free surface of a
stream, usually supposed to be convex, is here considered.
The evidence is shown to be very small. Some new special
experiments are cited. The conclu-ion is that the surface is
probably level across.Depression of Maximum Velocity: The
line of maximum velocity in an open channel is usually below
the surface. The cause of the depression is ob-cure. The
wind and distu bances from the banks and tied are usually
supposed to be the causes. The wind is probably too incon-
stant. The disturbances from the banks and bed seem an
inadequate explanation. The general depression of the maxi-
mum velocity on all verticals at all parts of a channel indicates
some resistance from above. The motion in open channels and
in rivers flowing full shows some similarity with differences in
detail fairly accounted for by supposing the air to be an ever
present efficient drag or source of resistance to forward surface-
flow, less intense than the banks or bed. If this be admitted the
hydraulic term "wet border " must be modified so as to include
all parts of the wet border, each with its own specific resistance.
On Compressed Air as applied to Locomotion, by Sir F. J.
Bramwell.The author dwelt uron the cases in which com-
pressed air might be advantageously employed for this purpose,
as for instance in the proposed Channel Tunnel and on tramw ays.

For the latter, some altered means of traction seems for several
reasons inevitable. One of these reasons is the undoubted
cruelty to horses which is the result of the present system. The
fact that compressed air can be satisfactorily used for this pur-
pose is proved by the tramways of Nantes, which for three years
and a quarter have been worked by this means. The various
difficulties to be expected on any tram-line, such as those from
curves and gradients, are to be found on that one which, running
beside the River Loire, connects Doulon and Chantonay. The
cars run every ten minutes from both ends of the line for fifteen
hours each day in summer, and fourteen hours in winter, and
during the time above mentioned there has been no hitch what-
ever. An arrangement called the " Hot Pot " is used to obviate
the loss of energy and the inconvenience arising from the well-
known fact that air becomes heated when being compressed,
and cools upon expansion. The apparatus consists of a vessel
of water into which steam is forced at the conclusion of each
journey. Through this heated water the compressed air is
passed, and is thus at the same time heated and lubricated. An
ingenious form of regulating-valve was also described, by means
of which a uniform working pressure is maintained, whatever

other receives a reciprocating motion from one of the wheels of
the locomotive, und so gives a continuous series of curves, the
relative closeness of which to each other measures the speed of
the train. From results given by this instrument a very instruc-
tive curve was drawn, showing the manner in which a train
comes to rest. Experiments were made on a piece of level line*

of 45 miles an hour, ran 5 miles and 5 yards after the steam was

THIS is a large octavo volume, extending to over 400
pages, and consisting of daily observations without
intermission of the psychological development of the
author's son from the time of birth to the end of the first
year, and of subsequent observations less continuous up
to the age of three years. Prof. Preyer's name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of the closeness and accuracy of any
series of observations undertaken with so much earnest-
ness and labour, but still we may remark at the outset
that any anticipation which the reader may form on this
point will be more than justified by his perusal of the
book. We shall proceed to give a sketch of the results
which strike us as most important, although we cannot
pretend to render within the limits of a few columns

any adequate epitome of so large a body of facts and
deductions.
The work is divided into three parts, of which the first
deals with the development of the Senses, the second
with the development of the Will, and the third with the
development of the Understanding.
Beginning with the sense of Sight, the observations
show that light is perceived within five minutes after
birth, and that the pupils react within the first hour. On
the second day the eyes are closed upon the approach of
a flame; on the nth the child seemed to enjoy the sen-
sation of light; and on the 23rd to appreciate the rose
colour of a curtain by smiling at it. Definite proof of
colour discrimination was first obtained in the 85th week,
but may, of course, have been present earlier. When
770 days old the child could point to the colours yellow,
red, green, and blue, upon these being named.
The eyelids are first closed to protect the eyes from the
sudden approach of a threatening body in the 7th or 8th
week, although, as already observed, they will close
against a strong light as early as the second day. The
explanation of their beginning to close against the
approach of a threatening body is supposed to be that an
uncomfortable sensation is produced by the sudden and
unexpected appearance, which causes the lids to close

without the child having any idea of danger to its eyes;
and the effect is not produced earlier in life because the
eyes do not then see sufficiently well. On the 25th day
the child first definitely noticed its father's face; when
he nodded or spoke in a deep voice, the child blinked.
This Prof. Preyer calls a "surprise-reflex"; but definite
astonishment (at the rapid opening and closing of a fan)
was not observed till the 7th month. The gaze was first
fixed on a stationary light on the 6th day, and the head
was first moved after a moving light on the nth day; on
the 23rd day the eyeballs were first moved after a moving
object without rotation of the head ; and on the 81st day
objects were first sought by the eyes. Up to this date
the motion of the moving object must be slow if it is to

be followed by the eyes, but on the 101st day a pendulum
swinging forty times a minute was followed. In the 31st
week the child looked after fallen objects, and in the 47th
purposely threw objects down and looked after them.
Knowledge of weight appeared to be attained in the 43rd
week. Persons were first distinguished as friends or

stage biting is as instinctive as sucking, and was first
observed to occur in the 17th week with the toothless
gums. Later than biting, but still before the teeth are
cut, chewing becomes instinctive, and also licking. Be-
tween the 10th and the 16th week the head becomes
completely balanced, the efforts in this direction being
voluntary and determined by the greater comfort of hold-
ing the head in an upright position. Sitting up usually
begins about the 4th month, but may begin much later.
In this connection an interesting remark of Dr. Lauder
Brunton is alluded to ("Bible and Science," p. 239),
namely, that when a young child sits upon the floor the
soles of its feet are turned inwards facing one another, as
is the case with monkeys. When laid upon their faces
children at earliest can right themselves during the 5th
month. Preyer's child first attempted to stand in the
39th week, but it was not until the beginning of the 2nd
year that it could stand alone, or without assistance. The
walking movements which are performed by a child much
too young to walk, when it is held so that its feet touch
the ground, are classified by Preyer as instinctive. The
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
time at which walking proper begins varies much with
different children, the limits being from 8 to 16 months.
When a child which is beginning to walk falls, it throws
its arms forwards to break the fall; this action must be
instinctive. In the 24th month Preyer's child began spon-
taneously to dance to music and to beat time correctly.
A chapter is devoted to imitative movements. At the
end of the 15th week the child would imitate the move-
ment of protruding the lips, at 9 months would cry on
hearing other children do so, and at 12 months used to
perform in its sleep imitative movements which had
made a strong impression while awakee.g. blowing;
this shows that dreaming occurs at least as early as the
first year. After the first year imitative movements are
more readily learnt than before.
Shaking the head as a sign of negation was found by
Preyer, as by other observers, to be instinctive, and he
adopts Darwin's explanation of the factviz. that the
satisfied suckling in refusing the breast must needs move
its head from side to side. In the 17th month the child
exhibited a definite act of intelligent adjustment, for de-
siring to reach a toy down from a press it drew a travelling-
bag from another part of the room to stand upon. We
mention this incident because it exhibits the same level
of mental development as that of Cuvier's orang, which
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
on desiring to reach an object off a high shelf drew a
chair below the shelf to stand upon. Anger was ex-
pressed in the 10th month, shame and pride in the 19th.
Between the 10th and nth month the first perception
of causality was observed. Thus on the 319th day the
child was beating on a plate with a spoon and accidentally
found that the sound was damped by placing the other
hand upon the plate j it then changed its hands and
repeated the experiment. Similarly at 11 months it
struck a spoon upon a newspaper, and changed hands to
see if this would modify the sound. In some children,
however, the perception of causality to this extent occurs
earlier. The present writer has seen a boy when exactly months old deriving much pleasure from striking the
keys of a piano, and clearly showing that he understood
action of striking the keys to be the antecedent
required for the production of the sound.
The third part of the book is concerned, as alrei:
stated, with the development of the Understanding. Here it is noticed that memory and recognition of the mother's voice occurs as early as the second month: l
4 months the child cried for his absent nurse; and i
18 months he knew if one of ten toy animals were re-
moved. In Preyer's opinionand we think there car t.

ing about her doll in her own perambulator, the writer
stole away the doll without her perceiving the theft.
When she thought that the doll had had a sufficiently
long ride, she walked round the perambulator to take it
out. Not findirg the doll where she had left it she was
greatly perplexed, and then began to say many times
"poor Na-na, poor Na-na," " Na-na ta-ta, Na-na ta-ta";
this clearly meantPoor Na-na has disappeared. And
many other examples might be given of this child
similarly using her small stock of adjectives and verbs
correctly.
According to Preyer, from the 1st week to the 5th
month the only vowel-sounds used are it and a. On the
43rd day he heard the first consonant, which was m, and
also the vowel o. Next day the child said ta-hu, on the
46th day go, oro, and on the 51st arra. All the vowel
sounds were acquired in the 5th month. We have no
space to go further into the successive dates at which the
remaining consonants were acquired. In the nth month
the child first learnt to articulate a certain word (ada) by
imitation, and afterwards repeated the taught word spon-
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
taneously. The first year passed without any other indi-
cation of a connection between articulation and ideation
than was supplied by the child using a string of different
syllables (and not merely a repetition of the same one) on
perceiving a rapid movement, as any one hurriedly leaving
the room, &c.; but this child nevertheless understood
certain words (such as "Handchen geben") when only
52 weeks old. Inefficient attempts at imitative speaking
precede the accurate attempts, and at 14 months this in-
efficiency was still very apparent, being in marked con-
trast with the precision whereby it would imitate syllables
which it could already say; the will to imitate all syllables
was present, though not the ability. At the beginning of
the 14th month on being asked"Wo ist dein Schrank?''
the child would turn its head in the direction of the cup-
board, draw the person who asked the question towards
it (though the child could not then walk); and so with
other objects the names of which it knew. During the
next month the child would point to the object when the
question was asked, and also cough, blow, or stamp on
being told to do so. In the 17th month there was a con-
siderable advance in the use of sign-language (such as
bringing a hat to the nurse as a request to go out), but
still no words were spoken save ma-ma, papa, &c. In
the 20th month the child could first repeat words of two
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
unlike syllables. When 23 months old the first evidence
of judgment was given; the child having drunk milk
which was too hot for it, said the word "heiss." In the
63rd week this word had been learnt in imitative speak-
ing, so it required %\ months for it to be properly used as
a predicate. At the same age on being asked"Where
is your beard ?" the child would place its hand on its chin
and move its thumb and fingers as if drawing hair
through them, or as it was in the habit of doing if it
touched its father's beard; this is evidence of imagina-
tion, which, however, certainly occurs much earlier in
life. At the close of the second year a great advance was
made in using two words together as a sentencee.g.
"home, milk," to signify a desire to go home and have
some milk. In the ist month of the 3rd year sentences
of three or even four words were used, as " Papa, pear,
plate, please." Hitherto the same word would often be
employed to express several or many associated mean-
ings, and no words appeared to have been entirely in-
vented. The powers of association and inference were
well developed. For instance, the child received many

certainly do not convey any very definite ideas to the
uninitiated. We will, therefore, endeavour to explain in
a few words what "Jacamars" and "Puff-birds" are.
The Jacamars or family "Galbulidae" of naturalists
form a small group of birds somewhat resembling the
kingfishers in general external structure, but with zygo-
dactyle feet, i.e. the toes placed two before and two
behind, and with brilliant metallic plumage. They in-
habit the forests of America from Guatemala to Southern
Brazil, and are generally met with perched upon the outer
branches of the trees, and capturing their insect-prey by
short flights, after which 'they return to their former
stationlike our common flycatcher. The known Jaca-
mars are nineteen in number, referable to six genera. Of
all of these species and, in most cases, of both sexes of
them, full life-sized figures are given in the present work,
from the artistic pencil of M. Keulemans. Of the accom-
panying letterpress it need only be said that it embraces
an account of all the particulars yet known respecting
these birds, which at the present time in several cases
amounts to very little, and in nearly every instance leaves

much to be done before we can be said to have anything
like a perfect knowledge of them.
Of the closely allied family of the Bucconida? or Puff-
birds nearly the same may be alleged as regards our
knowledge of their life-history. The dense wilds of South
America need many further years of constant exploration
and minute investigation before such particulars can be
duly recorded. The Puff-birds are a more numerous
group than the Jacamars. Mr. Sclater recognises forty-
four species of the family Bucconida;, divisible into seven
genera. These are treated in exactly the same way as
the Jacamars, and illustrated in a similarly artistic manner.
No one we think will be likely to find fault with the life-
like way in which the artist has represented the various
species. Even as a picture-book the Jacamars and Puff-
birds form a most attractive volume.
The work now completed is uniform in size and style
with Mr. Sharpe's "Kingfishers," Messrs. Marshalls'
"Barbets," and Capt. Shelley's "Sun-birds," and forms
one of the same series of illustrated Ornithological Mono-
graphs prepared by different Members of the British
Ornithologists' Union. Nor is the series likely to end
here, for we are informed that Mr. Dresser has a com-
panion volume on the Bee-eaters" in a very forward
state, and that other similar works are already projected.

of the work are the concluding chapters of vol. ii., in

summed up, the land revenue system of Persia dealt with

better fed than the Indian rayats. There is, of course,

Voles on Chemical Calculations, with Examples, for use
in the Leys School. By A. Vinter, M.A. (Batley;
J. S. Newsome, 1882.) The selection of calculations contained in this little book,
while exhibiting nothing new, is satisfactory ; the notes,
in so far as they are explanatory of the calculations, are
clear, and to the point, but when they deal with such
subjects as atoms, molecular weights, and equivalency,
they become sadly confused ; on these points they must,
we are afraid, be very misleading to the boys who make
use of this book in the Leys school.
A Pocket Guide to British Ferns. By Marian S. Ridley.
(London : Bogue, 1881.)
Miss Ridley's book merits its title; for it is of a most
convenient size for the pocket. Whether a new book on
British ferns was needed may fairly be doubted; but this
little volume will be useful to many beginners. The cha-
racters of each fern are given in tabular form, each occu-
pying a page; and the principal points of distinction are
clearly brought out.

A Meteorological Spectroscope
As a considerable amount of interest seems to have been
awakened lately in meteorol 'gical spectroscopy, it may be of
ervice to observers to call their attention to a form of pocket
spectroscope specially adapted for this purpose which Mr. Adam
Hilger, of 192, Tottenham Court Koad, prepared for me some
months ago. The compound triple prism of flint glass is
ii ounted as nearly as possible at the minimum angle of deviation
for "C." We thus obtain a much better view of the red end
of the spectrum thai with the ordinary pocket spectroscope.

sometimes into the hoop nets set for fish or "bobbers." For a
long time I have been unable to discover the meaning of the
word "bobbers." It occurs in no Dutch dictionary. .1 in-
quired from several Dutch friends without success, and an appeal
to Notes and Queries was similarly without result. On visiting
Leiden this summer I asked again about the wori, and my friend,
Prof. Serrurier, promised to find out about it for me. He now
writes that "bobber" is a Dutch mutilation of the Malay word
boeboe, meaning a hoop-net, so that Rumphius merely adds the
Malay term for the hoop-net to his statement, and does not
mention some other kind of trap besides this, in which nautilus
is to be caught as I had expected. This matter may :eem
scarcely worth troubling the readers of Nature with, but
Nautilus is so important a form, so little is known about its
habits, and naturalists so eagerly look forward to the day when
it shall be caught somewhere in numbers, and its developmental
history worked out, that every statement as to possible modes of
trapping it is of importance. It is just possible that suitably
baited lobster pots or hoop-nets, used in depths of 100 fathoms
or thereabouts, might be found efficacious. 

PROFESSOR HA ECKEL IN CEYLON1
V.
THE long account of his six week's stay in Belligam
(or Bella Gemma, "schoner Edelstein" as, in de-
fiance of etymology he delights to call it) contributed by
Professor Haeckel to the September number of the
Deutsche Rundschau will be disappointing only to those
who imagine that the theoretical and scientific results of
such a visit can be analysed, combined and presented to
the public within the compass of an article and in a
sufficiently popular form to interest the readers of a
magazine devoted to general literature.
All, whether scientific or not, will find interest in the
graphic and spirited account of Belligam, its Rest-House,
its inhabitants, and the surrounding nature, animate and
inanimate, which is here presented to us. The Rest-
House keeper with an unpronounceable Singhalese name
Prof. Haeckel christened" Socrates," from his striking re-
semblance to the bust of that great philosopher, heightened
by the sententious maxims with which he flavoured his
somewhat long-winded discourses. The Professor's de-
voted attendant, a handsome Rodiya boy, whose Singhalese
name, Gama-Meda, was classicised by him into "Gany-
mede," is described in detail with an affection that

rises into poetical fervour. The picture presented by
this poor outcast, the springs of whose heart were first
opened by the kind-hearted foreigner whom it became
the delight of his life to serve, is charming. "Who so
happy as Ganymede when summoned for an expedition
to the woods or the shore for painting and collecting,
hunting and shooting? When, on such occasions, I
allowed him to carry the paint-box or the photographic
camera, or to sling the gun or the botanical case over his
shoulder, he would stride after me, his face aglow with
delight, looking proudly around on the wondering vil-
lagers, to whom such favour shown to a Rodiya was
utterly incomprehensible.
"To Ganymede's unwearied skill and zeal I owe the
most highly prized objects of my collection. With the
sharp eye, the cunning hand, and the flexible agility of all
Singhalese youths, he could catch the fish as it swam, the
butterfly as it flew, and would bound into the thickest
jungle, or climb the loftiest trees like a cat, in search of
the prey that had fallen to my gun."

amassed at Belligam materials for the study of a life-
time, and even obtained some consolation from finding
confirmation of the fact which has recently been strikingly
demonstrated by the Challenger expedition, namely, that
life does not exist in anything like the same diversity of
form in different oceans as on different continents; and
that in essential features the marine fauna of one tropical
coast differs very little from that of another. The account
which Prof. Haeckel gives at some length of the daily
routine of his life in Belligam is interesting. The Pro-
fessor begins by congratulating himself on this accident
of position as affording him twelve clear working hours
in the day.
"I rose," he says, "regularly before the sun, and had
enjoyed my first morning bath by the time he showed
himself from behind the palm-woods of Cape Mirissa,
exactly opposite my Rest-House. As I stepped on to the
verandah to enjoy the sudden awakening of the glorious
day, I was sure of finding Ganymede with an open cocoa-
nut of sweet, cool milk, than which there could be no
more refreshing morning drink. William, in the mean-

scorpions, and other insects, which had crawled into their
folds during the night. Then came Socrates and served
me with tea, accompanied by a bunch of banana fruit
and the maize bread of the country. My usual beverage,
coffee, is, strange to say, so bad in Ceylon as to be un-
drinkable, principally because the extreme moisture of
the climate prevents the berry from drying properly.
"At seven o'clock my boatmen appeared to carry down
my nets and glasses for the daily canoe expedition. This
lasted from two to three hours, and on my return 1 busied
myself in disposing my captures in glasses of different
sizes, and saving such as could be saved among the few
survivors. The more important specimens were micro-
scoped and drawn at once. Then I had my second bath,
and at eleven o'clock appeared my so-called l breakfast,'
consisting chiefly of curry and rice. The rice was simply
boiled, but in the preparation of the curry my old cook,
Babua, exerted all the ingenuity with which nature had
endowed his diminutive brain to present me with a fresh
combination every day. Sometimes the curry was 'sweet,'
sometimes 'hot;' sometimes it appeared as an undefin-
able mixtum compositum of vegetables, sometimes as a
preparation of the flesh of various animals. Babua
seemed to divine that as a zoologist I was interested in

every class of animal life, and that he could not do better
than turn my curry into a sort of daily zoological problem.
... He was apparently a staunch upholder of the theory
of the near relationship of birds and reptiles, and held it
to be immaterial what particular species of Saurian were
prepared for the table.
"Fortunately for my European prejudices, I only became
acquainted by degrees with the zoological variety of my
daily dish of curry; usually not until I had swallowed a
considerable portion of it in silent resignation. . . . My
great resource as an article of diet was the fruit which
abounded at every meal and made up for all that I suffered
from Babua's curries. Next to the bananas of every
variety, of which I consumed several at every meal, my
standing dessert consisted of mangoes (Mangifera indicd),

HAVING recently passed through that part of Mada-
gascar which is the habitat of the Aye-aye, and
having made careful inquiries from the Malagasy respect-
ing the habits of this strange creature in its native haunts,
I have thought that the information gained might be of
interest to the readers of Nature, and therefore note
down the result of my inquiries.
The Aye-aye lives in the dense parts of the great forest
that runs along the eastern border of the central plateau
of the island, but only in that part of it which separates
the Antsihanaka province from that of the Betsimisaraka,
and which is about twenty-five miles from the east coast,
in latitude 170 22' S., or thereabouts. Possibly there are
other parts of the country where the Aye-aye is found;
but so far as my knowledge extends and I have made
inquiries in different parts of the islandthis is the only
region where the creature finds its home. In Carpenter's
"Zoology" the Aye-aye is said to be " very rare in its
native country"; and Mr. Gosse in one of his books con-
jectures that it is probably nearly extinct ; but, from what
I gathered from the natives, it seems to be pretty common,
its nocturnal habits and the superstitious awewitt'
it is regarded (and of which I shall presently sf^1
accounting for its apparent rarity.
The native name of the animal is Haihay (Hit1-

this is not derived from the "exclamations of WT-*

following will show. The natives have a superstitious
fear of the creature, believing that it possesses some
supernatural power by which it can destroy those who
seek to capture it, or do it harm. The consequence of
this is that it is with the greatest difficulty one can
obtain a specimen. With most of the people no amount
of money would be a sufficient inducement to go in pur-
suit of the creature, "because," say they, "we value our
lives more than money." It is only a few of the more
daring spirits among them who, knowing the bdiny, i.e.
the secret by which they can disarm it of its dreaded
power, have the courage to attempt its capture. Occa-
sionally it is brought to Tamatave for sale, where it
realises a good sum. Now and then it is accidentally
caught in the traps which the natives set for lemurs, but
the owner of the trap, unless one of those versed in the
Aye-aye mysteries, who knows the charm by which to
counteract its evil power, smears fat over it, thus securing
its forgiveness and goodwill, and then sets it free. The
story goes that occasionally, when a person sleeps in the
forest, the Aye-aye brings a pillow for himif a pillow

electricity and magnetism were in great measure
mere collections of qualitative results, and, in a less
degree, of results quantatively estimated by means of
units which were altogether arbitrary. These units, de-
pending as they did on constants of instruments and
conditions of experimenting which could never be made
fully known to the scientific public, were a source of
much perplexity and labour to every investigator, and
to a great extent prevented the results which they
expressed from bearing fruit to the furtherance of
scientific progress. Now happily all this has been
changed. The absolute system of units introduced by
Gauss and Weber and rendered a practical reality in this
country by the labours of the British Association Committee
on Electrical Standards has changed experimental elec-
tricity and magnetism into sciences of which the very
essence is the most delicate and exact measurement, and
enables their results to be expressed in units which are
altogether independent of the instruments, the surround-
ings, and the locality of the investigator.
The record of the determinations of units made by
members of the Committee, for the most part by methods
and instruments which they themselves invented, forms
one of the most interesting and instructive books in the
literature of electricity, and when the history of electrical

discovery is written the story of their work will form one
of its most important chapters. But besides placing
0.1 a sure foundation the system of absolute units,
they conferred a hardly less important benefit on elec-
tricians by giving them a convenient nomenclature for
electrical quantities. The great utility of the practical
units and nomenclature, which the Committee recom-
mended, soon became manifest to every one who had
to perform electrical measurements, and has led within
the last year to their adoption, with only slight al-
terations, by nearly all civilised nations. Although it
is not yet quite twelve months since the late Con-
gress of Electricians at Paris concluded its sittings,
the recommendations which it issued have been widely
adopted and appreciated by those engaged in electrical
work, and have thus begun to yield excellent fruit by
rendering immediately available for comparison and as a
basis for further research the results of experimenters in
all parts of the world. Soon even the ord.nary workmen

fn the bridge connecting the two sides of the frame a
sapphire cap is fixed, and this rests on an iridium-tipped
point standing up from the bottom of the containing
box. The sides of the frame are made long enough to
form when brought together at one end an index about
nine centimetres long of the shape shown in Fig. 2. The
point of the index ranges round a scale of tangents
placed round the curved edge of the bottom of the box.
To prevent error from parallax the bottom of the box, with
the exception of the narrow strip occupied by the scale,
is covered with a mirror of silvered glass. The observer
when taking a reading places his eye in such a position
that the point of the index just covers its reflected image,
and reads off the deflection indicated by the position of
the point of the index on the scale of tangents. The scale
is engraved on paper, and firmly fixed to the bottom of
the box by photograper's glue; and thus any change of
length due to varying amount of moisture in the
atmosphere is avoided.
The magnetometer box rests on three feet and a flat
spring. Two of these feet, which are in a plane perpen-

dicular to the plane of the box and passing through the
supporting point and the zero of the scale, slide in the v groove cut along the middle of the platform: the third
foot rests on the plane surface on one side of this
groove, the spring on the other side. By this arrange-
ment the magnetometer is rendered perfectly steady and
can be moved with perfect freedom along, but only along
the platform. A small circular level carried by the box
shows when the plane of the magnetometer is horizontal.
This adjustment is made by means of the two screws
which support the platform at the end remote from the
coil.
To lift the system of magnets and index off the bearing
cap when the instrument is not being used, or when it is
being carried from one place to another, a small collar-
piece free to move round the supporting point is raised
up by a horizontal screw turned by a head outside the
magnetometer box. When raised this collar-piece forms
a supporting platform for the needles and se.-urely
prevents them from moving about and sustaining damage.
To increase the directive force on the needles when
required, the semi-circular magnet shown in the drawing
is used with the instrument. This magnet is made of the
best steel, and is tempered glass-hard. It is magnetised by
sending a current through a semi-circular coil containing it.
When in position on the instrument it is supported on
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
two flat pieces of brass projecting from the radial sides
of the magnetometer box. The magnet terminates at
one end in a cross piece of brass having on its under
side at one end a small projecting brass knob. This
knob fits into a hollow in one of the projecting arms of
brass, while the other end of the cross piece rests simply
on the plane surface of the arm. The other end of the
magnet is brought to a rounded point which rests
in a v notch cut round a cylindrical shoulder on a
screw spindle (seen on the right-hand side of Fig. 2),
which works through a nut fixed to the other projecting
arm of the magnetometer box. The magnet thus rests
with its magnetic axis as nearly as may be in the hori-
zontal plane through the axis of the needle, and nearly
at right angles to the line joining the centre of the
needle's axis with the zero of the scale. Its axis may
be placed accurately at right angles to this line by turning
the screiv until the needle points accurately to zero.
The magnet thus mounted remains in the same position
relatively to the magnetometer.

one wire to the other, and the destruction of the wires.
Again the ends of the wires are almost sure when removed
from the instrument to be left dangling either in contact,
or so as to be easily brought into contact inadvertently
by a passer by, with the certain result if the dynamo is
running, of the immediate fusing of the wires. To pre-
vent the possibility of such an accident Sir William
Thomson has used as terminals for the coil two
strong strips of copper about ij cms broad which stand
up vertically facing one another about a centimetre apart,
within a vertical cavity in the wooden block behind the coil.
To prevent any current from flowing through the al
cept when a reading is being taken, the small springe*
key, shown behind the coil in Fig. 1, is insertedbetwei
of these terminals and the coil. The leads for ca
ing the instrument with the circuit have their ends brought together so as to terminate in two parallel strips cfi

the coil are attached. These bars are placed sufficiently
near together to be forced a little apart by the contact
piece, and thus give a secure spring contact. The leads are
made of thin stranded copper wire, well protected by a thick
woven covering of cotton, and are very flexible. They ter-
minate in two spring clips (shown in Fig. 1) made each of a
strip of stout copper held firmly against the flat side of a
piece of wood, of semicircular section, by an india rubber
band passed round a groove in a semicircular piece of
brass soldered to the copper strip, and round the back of
the piece of wood. A groove carried along the piece of
wood above the elastic band prevents the copper strips
from turning round relatively to the wood, and thus a
good and safe contact is made between the copper and
anything on which it may be clipped. These clips are
quite as efficient as binding screws and a great deal

II. The Current Galvanometer.
This instrument is shown in Fig. 3. It differs from the galvanometer above described only in the coil and arrangement of terminals. The coil is made of stout copper strip about r2 cm. broad and 1-5 mm. thick, wound in six turns, insulated by asbestos paper placed between. The outside diameter of the coil is aba
10cm., the inner diameter about 6cm. Itis covered like:

In special instruments for measuring very strong-rents the coil is made of a single turn of massive copper strip, fitted with proper terminals to obviate undue heating at the contacts. With this mode of construction, an instrument can be made which shall measure with accuracy currents of from i-ioth of an ampere W

nto or withdrawn from each circuit with as little disturb-
ince as possible to the current in that circuit. To do this
without the complications of switches or arrangements of
binding screws, the very simple plan of terminals, shown
in Fig. 3, has been adopted. The ends of the copper
strip forming the coil are brought out horizontally behind
the instrument, one above the other, with a thin piece of
wood between them for insulator. On one end of the
leads for attachment to these terminals is a spring clip,
formed of two stout strips of copper, one attached to each
lead, kept apart for a short distance along their length
by a thickish piece of wood, and held in their places
by a serving of waxed cord at that place. The
ends of the copper strips project beyond the sepa-
rating piece of wood about two or three inches, and are
bent round into similar curves, with their convexities
turned towards one another. They have sufficient spring
to bring their convex portions into contact, but they are
held together at that place by a stout india-rubber band
passed round a groove in the edges of the two semicircular
pieces soldered on the backs of the strips. The points,

however, of the strips are a little distance apart. If, now,
the clip just described be pushed over the terminals of
the coil, the jaws of the clip will be separated, but before
separation takes place each of them has come into
contact with a terminal of the coil. Hence if the
leads form part of a galvanic circuit, the current,
before the galvanometer is attached, passes from
one lead to the other across the jaws of the clips, and
after these have been separated, through the galvanometer

coil; and it is plain that no cessation of the current, and
in practical cases only an infinitesimal disturbance can
be caused by introducing the galvanometer. Sparks
are thus altogether avoided, and the galvanometer is
included in the circuit by a single simple and sure opera-
tion. When the leads are withdrawn from the coil-
terminals the action is simply the reverse, the jaws of the
clip have come together at their convexities before the
terminals of the coil have lost contact with them.
In practice two stout wires which have one pair of ends
attached to one of these spring clips are included in each
circuit, the current in which is to be measured by the
galvanometer. The instrument is placed with its leads
attached to its terminals in a convenient position, so that
the free end of the leads may reach easily the spring clips
        Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
of all the circuits. The terminals at that end are
similar to those of the galvanometer. They can
therefore be pushed in between the jaws of each
clip to allow the current to be read off, and with-
drawn without disturbing the current in the circuit. The
leads are shown attached at one end by their spring clip
to the galvanometer, and at the other end to a spring clip
supposed included by means of the two straight piecesjsf
wire in a galvanic circuit.
This arrangement is exceedingly useful for a great
number of purposes, as for example for measuring the cur-
rents charging secondary cells, or flowing through the
various parts of an electric lighting circuit, or for measur-
ing the whole current sent into the circuit by the dynamo
or generator. Andrew Gray

Two interesting cases of explosion are described by Ilerr

inserted a few centimetres deep in a bath of carbonic acid and
ether brought to a temperature of - ioo° C, in order to get

crystallised carbonic acid. Beautiful crystals were soon formed
in the immersed part of the tube, and a layer of the liquid acid
remained above. 1 he tube was then raised by its upper part
into the air, and in a few minutes it exploded violently. This
tube had often before borne a rise of temperature to 31°. The
explosion is attributed to thermal expansion of the solid carbonic
acid (as a more likely cause, than vapour-pressure on glass ren-
dered brittle by a low temperature). In the second case, a large
sheet zinc bell-gasometer, u?ed exclusively for keeping, oxygen
gas, was concerned. It had stood about six months unused,
containing a little of the gas. When the issuing gas was being
tested with a glowing match, an explosion occurred, shattering
the apparatus. Any entrance of hydrogen or coal-gas is out of
the question. It is supposed that the water had gradually
absorbed acid vapours from the air of the lab »ratory, and that
the zinc had been thus attacked, yielding hydrogen. The zinc
was in fact somewhat corroded. It is recommended that the
zinc in such cases be coated with a lac.

accelerate the reduction, such as alcohol and ether; and (4)
that, operating in the cold state and in darkness, the reduction is
more brilliant and rapid that when operating in light. On the
whole it appeirs that the reducing action referred to may be
applied indu-trially with advantage to the silvering of mirrors,

GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES
At the Southampton meeting of the British Association Mr.
Joseph Thomson read a paper On the Geographical Evolu-
tion of the Tanganyika Basin. The keynote of this paper is
struck by a reference to a recent lecture of Dr. Archibald Geikie.
to the Royal Geographical Society, in which he points out that
the days are now over in which the scientific geographer is
content with the simple description of the superficial aspects of
the various regions of the globe. He must also know how they
came to be, and what they have been in the past. This line of
inquiry is applied by Mr. Thomson to the lake regions of Central
Africa, but more particularly to the Tanganyika Basin. In the
first place he presented a bird's-eye view of the lake regions
from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean, bringing into relief only
the most prominent features of the geography, but describing
more in detail the aspect of the Tanganyika Basin, round which
the chief interest centres. From a description of these purely
superficial matters he proceeded to describe what these have
been in the remote past, and the manner in which they have

made, that the surface of the bed of glacial clay is onlv 85 centi-
metres below the present level of the lake, and 4 metres above
its bottom at Gentva. Hence the level of the lake at the time
in question must have been at least 3 metres above its present
level, for otherwise the Lower Rhone could not have existed.
As regards these estimates, it should be remembered that the
difference in time between the maximum and minimum levels of
the lake has to be reckoned by centuries, and that the volume
of rivers and lakes fed by Alpine snows varies with the
seasons."
M. Lessar, who made last year an interesting journey to
Saraks, has returned from a second journey in the same country,
as far as Herat, and publishes an account of it in the Golos. All
the route, from Askabad to Saraks, 185 miles, goes along the foot
of mountains through a completely flat country, which is usually
called Attek. This name, however, which signifies "the foot of
the mountains," is unknown in Persia and Afghanistan. That
part of this oasis, which was occupied by the Tekke-Turco-
mans, was usually known as Akhal, whilst the south-eastern
part of the oasis was known as Arakadj. Only two places of
the Attek, Luftabad and Shilghyan, are occupied by Persian

Shiites, the remainder are Turcomans, having immigrated from
Merv after a bloody struggle with the former inhabitants, at the
beginning of this century. The population live mostly in clay-
houses, the number of felt tents diminishing very rapidly, and
the clayhDUses which formerly were built within small earthen
fortifications, are now mostly erected outside of them. Water is
scarce in the Attek, the streams coming down from mountains
being few, and in the hands of Persians, who often take the
water for their fields. The population of the Attek, between
Askabad and Saraks, is estimated by M. Lessar, at about 7000
Turcoman inhabitants. They carry on agriculture, and have
g iod orchards, as well as good gardens in the neighbourhood of
the Persian settlements, but altogether they are very poor.

The weather had up to that date been dull with little rain. Wind

the opportunity of examining them and cross-examining them
yourselves at your leisure. The subject of my lecture, "Un-
written History, and how to read it, is, as you may imagine,
is one in which testimony of various kinds is admissible; and, as
in the case of many of the most important trials, much may
depend upon what, at first sight, would appear to be a trivial
common matter.
The term which I have used, "Unwritten History," is so
comprehensive that it might be made to embrace the whole series
of events which have happened in this world from its first
creation until the written annals of the historian begin. It might
be expanded so as to comprise the whole of the geological
record, as exhibited by the testimony of the rocks, and even to
go back to a time when it seems probable that the elements
composing our globe had not been consolidated, but existed in a
gaseous condition. I propose, however, to limit the term this
evening, so that it may not extend beyond the period during
which the human race has dwelt upon the earth. I need hardly
say that, compared with the time which geological facts prove
that the world has existed, this period of human occupancy is
relatively short, however vast it may appear when we come to
compare it with the few centuries embraced in our ordinary
chronology. But of this it will be time to speak when we have
traced back our evidence as far as our present knowledge will
enable us to go.

With regard to that evidence, or the means by which we must
attempt to read unwritten history, one of the principal aids that
can be called in is the written history of the past. The ancient
writings of Greek and Roman authors carry us back some three
thousand years; while the annals of Egypt and Assyria, and
those preserved in the pages of our Bibles, make us to some
extent acquainted with the habits and customs of still earlier
times. And in the same way the accounts of recent travellers
who have been brought in contact with races of men unacquainted
with even the most simple appliances of modern civilisation,
serve to throw a light on what must have been the condition of
most of the occupants of other parts of the world before those
appliances were known. But, after all, our best evidence is to
be derived from the relics of the past which, from time to time,
we find buried in the earth, and from the circumstances under
which they are discovered. Such relics are often of much
service even in illustrating that portion of past time which falls
within the limits of written history, especially so far as relates to
the habits and customs of everyday life, as to which, except
incidentally, our chroniclers are usually silent. The "princes

through the whole of Greece and her colonies along the shores
of the Mediterranean. Whether as the result of raids upon
Greek towns, or from more peaceful contact with Greek colonies
in what is now the south of France, the Gauls became acquainted
ivith them, recognised their usefulness, and proceeded to strike
coins in imitation of them. As was to be expected, the art of
these imitations was far inferior to that of the original coins.
Each copy in its turn served as a model from which other copies
w ere made, and as is often the cafe, the copies were in many
instances larger than the originals; so that by the time the art
of coining had reached the northern part of Gaul the size of the
coin had much increased, and the devices upon it bad degener-
ated into a widespread bust with a laurel-wreath, and with the
hair arranged in rows of locks of even size behind, and in
crescent-shaped curls in front, while additions had been made to
the original head in the shape of a kind of band around it and
an ornamental covering for the neck. Such coins have been
found in considerable numbers in England, principally in our
southern counties, and especially in Kent. Of their origin from

were known in Britain before Caesar's landing? It is in this
manner:There are some British princes whose names are
recorded by Roman historians and by Roman inscriptions, and
to whom therefore we can assign a fairly certain date; and of
some of these princes coins are known. They have on them
devices such as at first sight appear almost unintelligible, but
which by a succes-ion of intermediate forms occurring on coin?
without inscriptions upon them, cm be traced back to the head
with the laurel-wreath, while on the reverse fide there is always
a horse of more or less barbarous form. We have, therefore,
evidence of an uninterrupted succession of coins copied the one
from the other, btginnii'g with the coins with the widespread
head and ending with the inscribed coin=. Now each of these
successive copies must have been intended to pass current with
the coins from which they were copied, and if they had all been
of one weight and of one quality of gold it might have been
possible for the whole series to have been struck within no very
lengthened terms of years. But, as it happens, there is a great
diversity in the weight and fineness of the coins, those with the
w idespiead head being of fine gold, and often weighing nearly 120
grains, and the last of the series being of much baser metal and
only weighing about 84 grains. In the process of successive
copying only the most striking parts of the device, and those
mot easy to imitate, Mich as the wreath and locVs of hair,
survived, and the face, being more difficult to copy, was the first

to disappear. Coins with merely a mis-shapen lump upon them
in lieu of the face usually weigh about 96 grains, and the farther
they get from the original the lighter the coins become. Now
the original weight of the Pkilifpus was 133 grains; and assum-
ing that it was first imitated in B.C. 300, and that the we'ghthad
become reduced to 84 grains in B.C. 20, and also that the diminu-
tion in weight always went on at the same rate, we find by
calculation that the date at which the weight would have bscome
reduced to 120 grainsthat of the earliest liriti-h coinsis B.C.
226. Probably, however, there was a less tendency to reduce
the weight and quality at the beginning than towards the end of
the series, but the coins justify us in saying that the inhabitants
of southern Britain were sufficiently civilised to make use of a
coinage about 150 years before Chri t, or 100 years before the
time of our first Roman visitor, Julius Coe ar, if not indeed at
an earlier period.
Beside-i these gold, silver, :nd brass or copper coins, with
devices upon them derived from Gaulish copies of a Macedonian

found, could be rendered stronger by being hammered at the
sides so as to form flanges upon them, much like those on
modern rails. The blades were next cast with these flanges upon
them, and it was then found advantageous to make them expand
in the middle of the blade, so as to allow them to embrace the
two sides of the split haft in which they were mounted. Eventu-
ally these projecting wings were hammered over so as to produce
a kind of semicircular pocket for the haft on each side of the
blade. At this stage a brilliant idea occurred to some ancient
founder, and by means of a clay core he produced a single
socket in the body of the blade itself, and thus did away with
the labour of hammering out the wings on the flat blade and
turning them over, and also with the trouble involved in making
a deep notch in the haft, so that it might run down each side of
the blade. But these semicircular wings had become a recognised
feature in this class of hatchets, and out of regard to this fashion
the earliest of the socketed blades were cast with the two wings
on each face, in imitation of those of the older form. As has so
often been the case in such developments, what was at one time
of essential service survives at another as a useless ornament.
And now comes in this little bit of history which these hatchets

enable us to read. It is evident that the first socketed blades
must have been cast in a country where the prevailing type of
hatchet had the semicircular wings on each face; but this kind
of hatchet, though abundant in some parts of the Continent, is
very rare in Britain, and we are therefore ju?tified in concluding
that the art of casting hatchets with a socket was introduced into
this country from abroad. Not but what our native founders
cast plenty of hatchets of this socketed pattern when once they
were acquainted w ith it, for the moulds for producing them have
been found with lumps of metal and various bronze objects in
different parts of the Kingdom.
Not only were the bronze-using people skilful as founders, but
they understood how to work ornaments in amber and jet as well
as in gold, and some few specimens of their ornamental'inlaying
are such as would do credit to any modern workman. The
wooden handle of a bronze dagger found in the grave of a
warrior in Wiltshire was inlaid with thousands of minute gold
pins, arranged in regular patterns, and the amber pommel of a
dagger found in Devonshire was as delicately inlaid with gold as
any tortoise-shell patch-box of the last century.
The history of man in the bronze-using stage is, however,
better read on the Continent than here. On the shores of many
of the lakes of Switzerland, Italy, and the South of France the
remains of settlements belonging to the Bronze Age have been
discovered. As a safeguard against enemies and wild beasts,

it was a custom in those times to construct artificial islands, or
platforms carried on piles above the water, on which to erect
their dwellings. The same custom al=o prevailed within the
historic period both in Europe and Asia, and something of the
same kind was practised in Ireland until comparatively recent
times. A similar custom has been observed in other parts of the
world by modern travellers. In such buildings, from time to
time, disastrous fires occurred, and what was thus lost to the
original occupants has been preserved beneath the waters for the
instruction of long subsequent ages. Their houses seem to have
been formed of interlaced boughs smeared over with mud, after
the manner we now term "wattle and daub." They understood
the art of spinning and weaving both woollen and linen cloth.
Of domesticated animals they possessed the dog, ox, sheep, goat,
pig, and finally the horse. In this country they hunted the red
deer, the roe, the wild boar, the hare, and some other animals.
But they also were to some extent agriculturists, and reaped
their corn with bronze sickles. They made vessels of various
shapes in burnt clay, but were unacquainted with the potter's
wheel, though some cups of amber and a soft kind of jet were
apparently turned in a lathe. Though using so many and such

very handy, pretty, and convenient form. He utilises a principle
which he calls "surrexcitation." A thick ring of soft iron is
inserted between the ear-piece and the diaphragm, and this is
said to increase the attractive power of the little horse-shoe
magnet upon the vibrating iron diaphragm. A simple experi-
mental apparatus of M. Ader's shows that there is some founda-
ton for this fact: when a thin steel spring is adjusted close to
the poles of a magnet without being attracted by them, the
near approach of a mass of iron to the spring will cause it to be
attracted by the magnet.
D'Arsonval has also modified the Bell receiver. He has
placed the coil in a powerful magnetic field of annular form, and
lias thereby concentrated the lines of force upon the induced coil.
He brings the whole coil within the influence of the field. The
effects are said to be magnified, and the increased loudness is
not accompanied by the usual loss of articulation. Speech is
reproduced without any change of timbre.
Telephone receivers of the Bell type are all based upon the
magnetic effects of currents of electricity flowing around magnets
or bars of soft iron.

a bar of iron or the increment and decrement of the magnetism
of a magnet, will produce molecular disturbances, in its own
mass and in the matter about it, that lead to the oscillatory
motions of the whole which produce sonorous vibrations that
can be made manifest by various devices, and particularly by
that patented by Graham Bell.
Other principles of electricity have also been utilised for
telephonic receivers.
For instance, Mr. Edison used the electro-chemical effect.
The decomposition of a chemical solution in paper or on chalk
by the passage of currents through it, produces a modification
of the friction of two moving surfaces, which can reproduce
sonorous vibrations, and the result is a very loud-sounding
apparatus. I myself had the pleasure, in 1880, of submitting
to the Royal Society a receiver based on the electro-thermal
effects of the current. The passage of a current through wires
always heats them and therefore produces expansion. If the
wire be made fine enough, the heat is generated and dissipated
so rapidly, the expansion and contraction are so quick, that
sonorous vibrations are the result. Although I was able to
speak through it very clearly, I have not as yet developed this
instrument into a practical form. Professor Dolbear has recently
utilised the electro-static effects of currents. His receiver is
even more simple than that of Bell. Two flat circular discs of
metal are rigidly fixed very close to each other in an insulated

case of ebonite. When one disc is electrified positively by a
charge of electricity, the other is electrified negatively by induc-
tion. These two opposite states produce attractions varying in
force with the strength of the signals sent, and the result is that,
when telephonic currents are transmitted, we obtain sonorous
vibrations, and, consequently, the reproduction of speech.
Many other forms of telephone receivers have been devised
and exhibited, in fact I have recently seen quite a crop of them;
but as they involve no new principle, and introduce no particular
improvement, having been brought out chiefly to try to avoid
existing patents, I pass them over, and proceed to the next
branch of my subject.
Our present Patent Law is, unfortunately, in so disorganised
and chaotic a condition, that evasion is often possible, and hence
the questionable morality of doing a thing in another way, in
order to avoid the incidence of a royalty, is practically encouraged.
The possession of a patent is now no guarantee of property:
it is granted without any discrimination, and cannot be upheld
without tedious litigation and wasteful expenditure before a non-

place-. Conversation has been held in America over 410 miles;
in Persia it has been effected between Tabreez and Tiflis, 390
miles apart; in India, over a dis'ance of nearly 500 miles; in
Australia, of 300 miles; but in all these cases it was done either
at night or under exceptional circumstances, and in all cases the

have been held between Dover and Calais, between Dartmouth
and Guernsey, and between Holyhead and Dublin, but I know
of no case where any persons have spoken through more than
100 miles of submerged .cable. The reason of this diminution
of speaking distance is due to the electrostatic capacity of the
telegraph line, which absorbs the minute quantity of electricity
that makes up the currents employed for telephonic purposes.
In every submarine cable, before a signal can b; made at the
receiving end, the whole cable must be charged up with
electricity, and if there be not sufficient electricity sent in to
effect this purpose, practically no signal appears at the distant
end. With telephone currents on long cables the whole of the

electricity is, as it were, swallowed upthat is, none appears at
the distant end, or, if it does appear, it is rolled up in one con-
tinuous wave, bereft of those rapid variations that reproduce
sonorous vibrations. The newspapers said that the sound of the
bombardment of Alexandria was heard at Malta; but, in the
first place, the experiment was not tried, and, even if it had been
tried, It could not have succeeded. The use of underground
wires very seriously impedes telephonic extensions, and with our
present apparatus and present knowledge we cannot readily
speak over greater distances than 20 miles.
Disturbances.But there are other disturbing influences at
work of more serious import.
When two or more telephone wires run side by side, what is
said on one can be overheard on all the others; and when a
telephone wire extends along^de telegraph wires, every current
on the telegraph circuit is repeated in the telephone, leading to a
hissing, frying, bubbling sound that is not only very irritating,
but which on busy lines entirely drowns speech. When music
is transmitted on one wire, it can be heard equally well on all
wires running parallel and contiguous. This is due to induction
and to leakage.
(A.) Induction.Induction is a term employed to designate
the peculiar influence which electrified and magnetised bodies
exert upon conducting and magnetic masses in their neighbour-
hood. If two wires run side by side for some distance, every
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
current of electricity sent upon one wire will produce two
currents in the contiguous wire, the one at the commencement
and the other at the end of the primary current of electricity.
The greater the intensity, and the more sudden and abrupt the
commencement and the ending of the inducing current, the
greater effect it has on the induced wire. Those instruments,
consequently, which reverse their currents the most rapidly and
suddenly, produce the greatest disturbance. The powerful
alternative and intermittent currents used for certain electric
light systems are death to telephones: they cause an incessant
roar that renders speech an impossibility. There are some
apparatus in telegraphy that require very powerful currents to
work them, which are equally detrimental. Many attempts have
been made to cure this evil.
1. The sensitiveness of the receiver has been reduced to lessen
the influence of the disturbing currents, and the strength of the
telephonic transmitting currents has been increased so as to over-
power the induced currents.
2. The influence of one wire on the other has been screened
off by inserting metal coverings in connection with the earth
between them.

of lightning protectors. The use of double wires diminishes the
danger to a minimum. On the Continent and in America, how-
ever, telephones are invariably protected by lightning arresters
where one wire only is used.
There are certain natural currents flowing through the crust
of the earth. They are called "earth " currents, and at times
acquire such considerable energy, that, with a telephone pressed
to each ear, I have been told, although I have not experienced it,
that the noise made is as though "your brains were boiling."
This is due to the intermittent currents produced by the polarisa-
tion of the earth plates.
M. Van Rysslberghe has recently spoken between Paris and
Brussels upon a wire nearly 200 miles long, which was used at
the same time for ordinary telegraphy, but the experiment was
made early in the morning (4 a.m.), and was effected by retard-
ing the telegraphic currents, so as to modify the suddenness of
their rise and fall, by means of condensers and electro-magnets.
I am unable to understand the advantage of any gain in speaking
on a wire which is detrimental to telegraphic communication.
Speed is of more importance than speech, and we can telegraph
much faster than we can speak. In England speed is everything

and we eliminate every influence that retards speedcondensers
and electro-magnets in telegraphy circuits are out of the question.
M. Van Rysselberghe has endeavoured to extend the idea to
cure the effects of induction by destroying the main cause of the
disturbancethat is, by reducing the sudden rise and fall of the
prime telegraphic currents; but to do this means to retard
telegraphy, and we cannot afford in England to cripple the one
system in order to benefit the other.
I have recently tried an extremely interestinj experiment
between this place (Southampton) and the Isle of Wight, namely
to communicate across seas and channels without the aid of wires
at all. Large metal plates were immersed in the sea at opposite
ends of the Solent, namely, at Porthsmouth and Ryde, six miles
apart, and at Hurst Castle and Sconce Point, one mile apart.
The Portsmouth and Hurst Castle plates were connected by a
wire passing through Southampton, and the Ryde and Sconce
Point plates by a wire passing through Newport ; the circuit was
completed by the sea, and signals were passed easily so as to
read by the Morse system, but speech was not practical.
The telephone is very rapidly gaining ground, and, as
improvements are effected in its accessories, in its installation,
and in its mode of working, its use will still further extend. In
Germany it is nsed very extensively for telegraphic business,
there being 1,280 stations worked entirely by telephones, but in

MODERN PHYSICS
The Concepts and Theories of Modern Physics. By J. B.

1882.)
I^HIS is, in many respects, a curious work. It shows
very extensive reading, as well as much patient
thought, on the part of its author; and is, throughout, emi-
nently "readable," although somewhat disfigured by the
use of strange and uncommon words, such as "question-
ability," "irrecusable," "luminar," "consiliences," &c,
and even of words apparently made for the occasion.
With engaging frankness, the author tells us in the Pre-
face that a previous work of his was written when he
"was under the spell of Hegel's ontological reveries :
at a time when I was barely of age and still seriously af-
fected with the metaphysical, malady which seems to be
one of the unavoidable disorders of intellectual infancy.
The labour expended in writing it was not, perhaps,
wholly wasted, and there are things in it of which I am
not ashamed, even at this day; but I sincerely regret its
publication, which is in some degree atoned for, I hope,

by the contents of the present volume."
His recovery from this direful malady has been un-
usually complete; but the sequelae are still of a somewhat
distressing character, for the work is "designed as a
contribution, not to physics, nor, certainly, to metaphysics,
but to the theory of cognition."
Having been himself at one time enchanted in the
Circean sty of metaphysics, the author now sees the evil
thing everywhere rampant, and specially in scientific
writings. With a subtlety which is occasionally almost
admirable, he seems to endeavour, under cover of perfect
candour and confidence along with intense zeal for the
interests of science, to insinuate into the reader's mind
doubts of the validity of some of the most fundamental
of scientific hypotheses and reasonings. We rise from a
perusal of his volume with a feeling of dawning doubt
which happily vanishes the moment we attempt to find a
justification for it. We can, however, fancy some ardent
student, unversed in laboratory work and with no great
knowledge of physical principles, falling an easy victim to
the doubts here suggested; the author all the while
smiling grimly to himself as did the spirit of negation
when his admiring victim exclaimed

This insidious weakening of the student's faith in prin-
ciples and methods is perhaps even more dangerous to
scientific progress than what the author in his Preface
speaks of as
"the shallow and sciolistic materialismI allude, of
course, not to its supposed ethical but to its purely intel-
lectual aspectswhich for a time threatened to blight the
soil and poison the atmosphere even of the old highlands
of thought on the continent of Europe, [and which] claims
to be a presentation of conclusions from the facts and
principles established in the several departments of
physical science."

according to their size, like small shot,' and that, there-

are as inadmissible as the reasoning upon them is incon-
clusive. It postulates what it professes to explain; it is a
solution in terms more mysterious than the problema
solution of an equation by imaginary roots of unknown
quantities. It is a pretended explanation, of which it
were unmerited praise to say that it leaves the facts

schools of exact thought and rigorous analysis, should
have wasted their efforts upon a theory so manifestly

which the very thing to be explained is but a small
part of its explanatory assumptions. But even the intel-
lects of men of science are haunted by pre-scientific
survivals, not the least of which is the inveterate fancy
that the mystery by which a fact is surrounded may be
got rid of by minimising the fact and banishing it to the
regions of the extra-sensible. The delusion, that the
elasticity of a solid atom is in less need of explanation
than that of a bulky gaseous body, is closely related to the
conceit that the chasm between the world of matter and

that of mind may be narrowed, if not bridged, by a rare-
faction of matter, or by its resolution into forces. The
scientific literature of the day teems with theories in the
nature of attempts to convert facts into ideas by a process
of dwindling or subtilisation. All such attempts are
nugatory; the intangible specter (sic) proves more
troublesome in the end than the tangible presence. Faith
in spooks (with due respect be it said for Maxwell's
thermo-dynamical 'demons' and for the population of
the 'Unseen Universe') is unwisdom in physics no less
than in pneumatology."

1871, Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson described to the Royal
Scottish Society of Arts forms of intermittent lighthouse appa-
ratus for exhibiting groups of flashes of occultations of unequal

Babbage's original proposal, that during dark intervals the light
is not simply stopped by a screen and thus lost, but sent usefully

The August Meteors
As noted in Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 378, I observed a bright
display of meteors on the night of August 6, at Aberfeldy. On
the 7th the sky was overcast with dense clouds all night; but on
the following night I saw a more brilliant shower of meteors
than on the 6th, with this difference that the meteors of the night
of the 8th were mostly oi several seconds' duration, and generally
left a long, bright train of light behind; alio, in place of being
on the north of the Milky Way, as on the 6th, they were chiefly
on the south of it. A very large and bright meteor burst out
abjut half way to the zenith, and moved nearly horizontally

from the s null-east towards the west, leaving a long shining
streak behind, and lasting cl >se on fifty seconds. I watched the
meteors for the next three nights from the parish manse of Logie-
Almond, and witnessed on each night (9, 10, and 11) a gorgeous
shower. On the evening of the 10th, before the twilight was
quite gone, I noticed thirteen very large meteors during the
space of a few minutes, although my view of the heavens was
very much intercepted by trees and by the manse. Between
11 and 12 o'clock a meteor considerably larger and brighter than
Venus under the most favourable circumstances, sailed over the
southern heavens, leaving a long train of light which lasted fully
a minute. Its position, time, and appearance, were nearly
the same as those of the large meteor I saw at Aberfeldy
on the night of the 8th. I have not for years, during any
month, witnessed such a gorgeous display of meteors as I have
seen on the nights specified in August last. But I have scarcely
seen any since, except a few bright ones on Sunday night,
September 17, at High Blantyre. The display of the August
meteors was of a very short duration on each night, and after
12 o'clock not one scarcely could be seen.

ANIMAL INTELLIGENCEl
T7ROM the time of Locke downwards the question,
-*- How far animals have the power of abstraction?
has often been discussed. Locke himself maintained that
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
"the having of general ideas is that which puts a perfect
distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency
which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to." And this view is warmly advocated by Prof. Max Miiller and other living thinkers. On the other hand Mr.
Romanes, who has made the subject of Animal Intelli-
gence a special study, writes :" Give a cat or a dog
some kind of meat or cake which the animal has never
met with, and the careful examination which the morsel
undergoes before it is consigned to the mouth proves that
the animal has properly abstract ideas of sweet, bitter,
hot, nauseous, or in general, good for eating, and bad for
eating, i.e., abstract ideas of quality as apart from the
object examinedthe motive of the examination clearly
being to ascertain which general idea of quality is
appropriate to the particular object examined."Nature, vol. xx., p. 123.
Our first duty in a case like this is to make quite sure
of the meaning of the words we employ. Much con-
fusion may be, and has been, introduced into this subject
by a lax use of words. Let us consider, then, the several
meanings which these terms abstraction and abstract idea
may have.
In the first place it seems to me that our most ordinary

in its character, like Mr. Galton's composite photographs of the average blackguard? And if it be a symbol of some kind, must it not be a symbol that stands for strange man in general, since there is nothing to suggest any
particular strange man? But if this be so, and if a general conception is one which stands not for a particular object, but for a group of objects, I do not see how we can deny general conceptions, in this sense of the word,
to our four-footed friends. And if the word abstract idei
stand, as it is sometimes made to do, for general concep-
tion, we must admit, I think, that such abstract ideas are
possible for the brute.
We come now to such abstract ideas as result from the
process 1 termed isolation. Are these, too, possible for
the brute? I have only to say that it has always seemed
to me that when we speak of being able to form abstract
ideas of redness, emptiness, justice, and the like, all we
can possibly mean is that we can make use of the
words as symbols in a train of thought I have
only to say this to indicate the nature of my answer
to this question, I believe such abstract ideas to be
impossible for the brute, I believe them to be the
outcome of the use of language. We see a plum, and
we find that it is round, and blue, and resisting. From
these words we form abstract nouns, roundness, blueness,
resistance. We then proceed to manufacture a something
to which each of these words may answer, and we call that
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:12 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
something a quality. Having thus made the quality, the
next thing we do is to try and endow it with a separate
existence, and to the results of our endeavours we give
the name abstract idea. All this is a process which grows
out of our use of words under the influence of a developed
power of reflection; it is an attempt to conceive a reality-
in-thought answering to certain of our symbols. Without
a considerably developed use of symbols such a process is
impossible. Hence 1 believe that no animal can form an
abstract idea in this sense of the term. He does not pos-
sess the only possible means of doing so. To form such
abstract ideas as these, is certainly "an excellency which
the faculties of brutes do by no means attain to." Here we
may agree with Locke and his followers.
May we say, then, that the power of forming abstract
ideas, in this sense, is that which distinguishes the intelli-
gence of man from the intelligence of the brute? I think
not. There are. I believe, among the lower races of man,
whole tribes which are unable to form abstract ideas.
Abstract ideas are made possible by language, but the use
of language does not necessarily imply the ability to form
abstract ideas. Philologists tell us that there are languages
or dialects in which no abstract words are to be found.
This, however, is certain, that there is no known savage
tribe which has no language. Man is the one being that
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
can make use of spoken signs.
But it may be said that, although their language differs
from ours, animals too have their language, imperfect it is
true but still a language of their own, a means of com-
munication with their fellows. And this is perfectly true.
It is true, too, that my dogs can understand my language.
But all that a dog can communicate to his fellowall that I
can communicate to my dog is a sign which he has learnt
to associate with certain feelings or with certain actions to
be performed. The communication deals, too, with imme-
diate feeling or action; its sphere is the here and the
now. There can be no doubt that dogs associate with
barking in certain tones, special emotional states in their
companions. In fact it is probable that dogs can in this
way communicate with each other a wide range of states
of feeling. But these states are present states, not states
past or future. They are their own states, not the states
of thinking in picturespictures far truer and more beautiful than even they
could describe in words. All processes of thought, in fact, are carried on by
association. And in (ha chain of association there may be links of all kinds
furnished by all the senses we possess. All that we can say with regard to

bearing on the physical and social characteristics of the
aborigines. But no fresh discoveries of any moment are
likely to be made, nor is it at all probable that anything
will be brought forward in the least calculated to shake
the general conclusions already arrived at.
Until the appearance of Herr Rein"s large work on
Japan,1 one of the most universally-accepted of these
conclusions was that, whatever be their affinities, the
Ainos must certainly be separated from the Mongolic
connection. No little surprise was accordingly produced
by Rein's attempt to affiliate them to the surrounding
members of the Yellow Race. But it was soon seen that
his arguments, apparently inspired by a love of paradox,
were sufficiently refuted by the very illustrations of the
Aino type introduced into his work. It is therefore satis-
factory to find that his views meet with no countenance in
these memoirs, the authors of which emphatically reject
the Mongol theory. "I cannot discover," writes Dr.
Scheube. "the Mongolic type in the Ainos. The great
development of the hair, the disposition of the eyes, the
nasal formation, the moderate breadth between the cheek

bones, the absence of prognathism, are all so many traits
separating them from the Mongolians" (p. 3). So also
Siebold: "The whole physiognomy and configuration of
the Ainos has little of a Mongol character. The general
impression they made on me was rather that of Europeans
living under unfavourable conditions. I had a feeling,
which also seemed to dawn upon them, that I was not
associating with an alien race ; and however strange it
may appear, I cannot but compare the Ainos with the
Russian peasantry " (p. 10).
Topinard had already declared that "the Ainos of
Japan, the Miaotze, and the Lolos of the province of
Yunnan belong, in my opinion, to the European group"
(" Anthropology," p. 476). And it is extremely suggestive
to find this writer also comparing them with the inhabi-
tants of the Moscow district. "Chose absolument singu-
liere, ce type celebre des Ainos, avec ses traits aujourd'
hui bien connus et sa barbe inculte, serait celui de cer-
tains paysans russes des environs de Moscou" {Rev.
d'Anthrop., 1879, p. 637). The same resemblance with
the Russians has no doubt been detected in the Itelmen
people of Kamchatka and among some of the Ghiliak
tribes of the Lower Amur districts. But the presence of
the Aino element has long been suspected in both of
these regions. Most of the Kurile islands are still

peopled by them, while the nomenclature of the whole
archipelago is distinctly Aino, as shown by the term
Moshir = Island, reaching as far north as Para-moshir,
close to Cape Lopatka, at the extremity of Kamchatka.
In the Lower Amur valley also W. G. Aston speaks of an
Aino tribe called Santal or Sandan (Church Missionary
Intelligencer, August, 1879); Siebold (p. 12) refers the
Kilengs and Kachengs of the neighbouring Hingpu River
to the same connection, and also mentions certain Aino
communities about Castries Bay, over against Sakhalin.
The southern portion of this island is itself Aino domain,
although, since its annexation to Russia, a considerable
emigration has set in towards Yeso. In Nippon the
Japanese records bring the Aino at least as far south as
the latitude of Tokio, whence they were gradually driven
north or absorbed, leaving traces of their presence both
in the Japanese type and in the geographical terminology
of the northern provinces of the main island. Lastly,
the national traditions point to North-East Asia as the
region whence they migrated to their present homes.
It is thus sufficiently evident that the Mozin (Mao-chin,

And as the quality of the hair is a much more durable
feature than the complexion, or almost any other physical
trait, the necessity of separating the Ainos from the
Mongolic stock becomes all the more obvious. If all
this, combined with a distinct orthognathism, meso-
cephalic head (index No. 76), a light complexion, often
scarcely darker than that of Europeans, brown iris, large
well-shaped nose, and low cheek bones, is not sufficient
to affiliate them to the Caucasic stock, then anthropo-
logists must discover some other sufficiently differen-
tiated physical type with which to group them. That
various branches of the Caucasic race reached the
East Asiatic seaboard in prehistoric times has been
pointed out by this writer in a recent paper on the
Koreans (see Nature, vol. xxvi , p. 344). From Korea
to the Japanese Archipelagos, the transition is easy,
although it is not pretended that the line of migration
necessarily followed this route. But enough has perhaps
been stated to show that there is nothing extravagant in
the theory of a Caucasic origin of the Aino race. Some
of the intermediate links between them and their western

kinsmen have already been brought to light. The others
must be looked for in the still unexplored uplands of
South-west China and Further India.
It is also to be noticed that the Ainos can only in a
relative sense be regarded as the Aborigines of Yeso and
Nippon. Scheube tells us that they are entirely ignorant
of the potter's art (p. 11). But abundance of ancient
pottery, often highly ornamented, has been found in many
parts both of Hondo and Yeso. These remains are
referred by the Ainos themselves to the extinct Koro-pok-
Guru, or "People of the Hollows." their precursors in
Yeso, who dwelt in huts built over pits, and who had a
knowledge of pottery. The Japanese also refer the pits
found on an island near Nemuro, north-fast coast of
Yeso, to the Kohito, a dwarfish race, said to have been
exterminated by the Ainos, and apparently identical
with the Koro-pok-Guru. It becomes a question whether
with these potters, rather than with the Ainos, are to be
associated the earthenware and other prehistoric remains
found by Milne in the kitchen middens of the Tokio
district and other parts of Japan. These remains show
clear traces of cannibalism, a practice which seems
entirely alien from the mild and inoffensive disposition
of the Ainos.
But however this be, the present Aborigines seem

destined at no distant date to disappear like their prede-
cessors. The total number of full blood Ainos is esti-
mated by Scheube at about 17,000 for Yeso, to which
must be added, perhaps, 1000 or 1500 for Sakhalin and
the Kuriles. Siebold, however, thinks that one-third of
the inhabitants of Yeso, say 45,000 altogether, are either
pure or half-caste Ainos. But the former are known to
have decreased in the government of Sapphoro from over
16,000 in 1871, to 13,326 in 187S, while the latter seem to
be correspondingly on the increase. The result is inevi-
tablethe effacement of the Ainos as a distinct nation-
ality, and their ultimate absorption in the dominant race.
The process that has been completed in Nippon is in
rapid progress in Yeso. A. H. Keane

The Balance (Figs. 4 and 5) is made with two sole-
noids, s and s', whose relative resistances is adjustible.
s conveys the main current, and is wound with thick wire
having practically no resistance, and S' is traversed by a
shunt current, and is wound with fine wire having a re-
sistance of 600 ohms. In the axes of these two coils a
small and light iron tube (2 m.m. diameter and 60 m.m.
length) freely moves in a vertical line between two guides.
When magnetised it has one pole in the middle and the
other at each end. The upward motion is crontrolled by
the spring NT. The spring rests upon the screw, H, with
which it makes contact by platinum electrodes. This
contact is broken whenever the little iron rod strikes the
spring, N T.
The positive lead from the dynamo is attached to the
terminal, b, then passes through the coil, S, to the ter-
minal, b', whence it proceeds to the lamp. The negative

switch, CD, which can be placed at E or D. When it is
at E, the negative terminal, a, is in communication with
the positive terminal, e, through the resistance, R, which
equals the resistance of the lamp, which is therefore out
or circuit. Whe i it is at D the cutoff acts automatically
to do the same thing when required. This is done by a
solenoid, v, which has two coils, the one of thick wire
offering no resistance, and the other of 2000 ohms resist-
ance. The fine wire connects the terminals, a'and u.
The solenoid has a movable soft iron core suspended by
the spring, u. It has a cross piece of iron which can dip
into two mercury cups, G and K, when the core is sucked
into the solenoid. When this is the case, which happens
when any accident occurs to the lamp, the terminal, A, is
placed in connection with the terminal, K, through the

it was done by the switch, C D.

H is broken, and the current passes through the electro-
magnet of the break in the lamp. The break is released for
an instant, the carbons approach each other. But the same
rupture of contact introduces in the shunt a new resistance
of considerable magnitude (viz. 1200 ohms), that of the
electromagnets of the break. Then the strength of the
shunt current diminishes considerably, and the solenoid,
s, recovers briskly its drawing power upon the rod, and
contact is restored. The carbons approach during these
periods only about '01 to "02 millimetre. Ifthisisnot

the science of the prevention of disease advances quite as

distinctly admitted that chemical analysis is unable to
detect those small quantities of morbific matter which are
capable of conveying disease, and he has himself mingled
choleraic dejecta with water without being able to detect
any noteworthy chemical alteration in its quality. The
standard which should be aimed at in this matter of
water-supply is the same as that advocated by Captain
Galton in other matters such as sewerage, ventilation, &c,

address gives many instances, whether in connection with
Indian fairs or elsewhere, to show that scrupulous clean-
liness should be the aim of sanitarians, and this is at least
as desirable in connection with water services and water-
.courses as elsewhere.
The address having been delivered at Newcastle-upon-
Tyne, it was but natural that frequent reference should have
been made to sanitary administration in that borough, and
to the results attendant upon it. The need for the isola-

tory to note from the recently issued Report of the Medical
Officer of the Local Government Board, that a consider-
able proportion of the sanitary authorities in England
have already recognised the necessity for making some
provision for the removal of the infectious sick from
amongst crowded communities. But it is also evident
that the accommodation provided should be of an efficient
character. At Newcastle there is hospital provision for the
infectious sick, but we fear that even whilst the Congress
is sitting, the inadequacy of the accommodation available
there is causing anxiety to those who are responsible for
the health of the borough. The extension of sanitary
hospitals to every part of the kingdom is much to be desired,
and the suspicion of their possible influence for evil which
is adverted to in the address, need not in any way hinder
action in this direction. The only disease which has ever
been alleged to extend from such hospitals to the surround-
ing neighbourhoods is small-pox, and even that disease is
not suspected of having any such influence except when a
large number of patients are aggregated together. The

Rowland Hamilton read a paper on the endowment of research.
"As to the endowment of the more special forms of research as
more commonly understood," he said, "there is hardly any limit
which it is desirable to assign to it provided due assurance is
given that the work desired is efficiently carried out. The ser-
vices thus rendered are pre-eminently of general and national
importance, and must be provided for by national expen liture.
The economic doctrine oc supply and deooand as regards the
interchange of individual services is wholly inapplicable to the
question. The difficulty lies in the administration of the funds
devoted to such purpo es so as to insure that they are given to
tho e duly qualified to use them. The method of State grants
in aid, dispensed through the agency of existing societies and
learned bodies who have earned a title to public confidence,
might be largely developed with the greatest advantage and the
relative functions of the Government and of such so-ieties in
their relation, to this subject were discussed. The multiplica'ion
of 'idle fellowships ' had a demoralising tendency. While any
undue interference on the part of the central adininiitration was
to be altogether deprecated, it was essential to reserve to the
State an ultimate and quasi ju Hoial con'rol, which woull best
secure that publicity and definite responsibility which are the
best safeguards against abuses in any dire;tion." In speaking
01 the subject of technical trailing Mr. Hamilton remarked that
it was n it neccsary to teach special crafts in primary schools,

but it was most desirable that a general sc'e.itific groundwork in
technical knowledge should be included in a system of rational
education.
The Iron and Steel Institute meeting at Vienna has evidently

At a recent meeting of the Franklin Institute it was shown by
Mr. Grimshaw that the microscope may be of gool service in
estimating the value of structural material-. It may determine
whether or not the material is good enough to warrant trial with
the testing machine. The author produced photographs of a
chip of timber from a highway bridge that was wrecked two
years ago, after a few days of service, through the strain caused
by an empty truck; and the poor character of the wood was at
once apparent. Such micro-photographs of timber, in fact,
show that in the strong specimens, the concentric rings are close
in texture and of slight width, and the radial plates frequent,
wide, long, and thick, while the reverse is found in the poor
material. As a parallel in metal-work, Mr. Grimshaw exhibited
two portions of pure Lake copper, one an ordinary ingot, of
coarse and crystalline grain, dark red colour, and full of blow-
holes; the other, cast with proper precautions against oxidation,
the grain close and fine, the colour salmon, and no blowholes.
Tests of tensile strength of sheet and wire from these materials
strikingly confirmed the indications of the microscope.

A N attempt has been made by Signor Serpieri to connect, in
an indirect way, two very dissimilar phenomena, viz., the attrac-
tion of the sun and moon, and the periodical revival of vulcanism
in its more common manifestations He finds support for his
view (Real? 1st. Lombard., August 3) in a recent observation by
M. Daubree in the deep gallery (for the Channel tunnel) made
in the Rouen chalk, where it was noticed that the pits showed
oscillations of level quite concordant with the varying tide above,
the water abundant at high tide, and scanty at low tide; which
is easily understood (says M. Daubree), since all aquiferous
strata there pass under the sea. Accepting this variation in the
water of terrestrial depths with the sea-level, and knowing, on
the other band, that sea water has a principal part in the activity
of volcanoes (as proved by the nature of their products and the
immense quantity of aqueous vapour, which cause and maintain
eruptions), it is natural, Signor Serpieri says, to conclude that
the volcanic activity must present phases agreeing with those of
the tide, and thus there appears a certain connection with the
age and the position of the moon. Observations of a large
number of earthquakes should also present the relation in ques-
tion, as these are known to be mostly of volcanic origin, and to

preferably affect coa^t regions; and M. Perry observed they
were more frequent at syzygies and perigee of the moon. Prof. Bombicci has also observed in some parts of Italy a greater
frequency of earthquakes at times of heavy and prolonged rains,
which he regards as the exciting cause in such cases; and pre-
cisely because not all seismic centres are fed with sea-water, it
is vain to expect that the luni-solar influence on earthquakes may
be always made out. Thus the anomalies recorded by Schmidt
and others may be explained.

their edges ground or polished first began. The period during
which they were exclusively employed has teen called the
Neolithic or New Stone Period. It has also been called the
Surface Stone Period, as the relics belonging to it are usually
found upon or near the surface of the ground, and not at a
considerable depth below it, like those belonging to an earlier
chapter in our history, which actually form constituent parts of
extensive geological deposits. There is this also to be observed,
that the circumstances under which the stone implements of this

general features of the country has taken place since the time
when they were in use. There was the same disposition of
hill and valley ; rivers ran along much the same course as now,
and at much the same level; the same animals frequented the
country with but few exceptions, and though there may have
been incursions of foreign races of men, we find the Stone Age
shading off into the Bronze Age, and the latter into the Iron
Age, not many centuries before the Roman occupation Although
it is impossible to say for what length of time this Neolithic or
Surface Stone Period may have endured in Britain, there is little

existence for the human race than the six thousand years that
used commonly to be assigned to it. In other parts of the
world, as for instance in Egypt, there have been circumstances
brought to light which prove that the ordinary chronology is
insufficient for the history of those countries ; and, in addition,
there are facts known with regard to the development of
language which have led many students to the conclusion that the
antiquity of man is much greater than was commonly supposed.
And yet five-and-twenty years ago, or less, there was no one who
could point to traces of human occupation in Britain of an
earlier date than the polished stone instruments. I might,
perhaps, make an exception in favour of Mr. [ohn Frere, who,
at the beginning of this century, inferred frrom the circumstances
under which some stone weapons were found, that they belonged
"to a very remote period indeed, even beyond that of the
present world."
If it had been my lot to address yon in 1858 instead of in
1882, I should myself have assured you that the earliest chapter
in our unwritten history was that which related to the polished
stone hatchets and the other forms of stone weapons and instru-
ments which are found associated with them. At the same time
I should not have agreed with Dr. Johnson, that " all that is
really known of the ancient state of Britain is contained in a few
pages. We can know no more than the old writers have told
us." But within the last twenty years what a lengthened vista

of the antiquity of our race has been opened out, and what a
marvellous chapter of unwritten history have we not to some
extent been able to read!
It is to that chapter that I must now turn, and, in examining
it, it will perhaps be best first to state some of the facts which
of late years have come to our knowledge, and then to show
what inferences have been drawn from tbem.
Geologists have long been aware that along the valleys of our
principal rivers, generally at some height above their present
level, and often at some distance from the streams, there are beds
of gravel, sand, and brick-earth, frequently containing the
remains of land and fresh water shells, and the bones of various
animals. That these drift-deposits were not due to the action
of the sea is shown by the absence of sea-shells, while the
general resemblance of the land and fresh-water shells in them
to those in the existing stream and valley prove them to have
been deposited by fresh water. The presence in the beds of
the bones of land animals is al-o corroborative of this view;
while the fact that several of these beast-;, such as the great
woolly elephant or mammoth, the rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
and reindeer, are of species now extinct, or no longer known in

always the broad end that is sharpened, and this has often been
effected by grindirg or polishing the edges, while in the imple-

the Palaeolithic or Ancient Stone Period, though it is sometimes
also termed the River-drift Period, as the implements belonging
to it are usually found in river-drift. Of the other appliances in

occupied as dwellings the reindeer still formed a principal article
of food in the South of France. Those who hunted it were
sufficiently good artists to carve figures of it in bone, or to
engrave them on slabs of slate. Some representations of the
elephant have also been found. They carved harpoons in rein-
deer horn, prepared skins with stone scrapers, and sewed them
together by means of bone needles, probably using reindeer
tendons as thread. The men, however, who were in this state

of civilisation lived at a time when the valleys had been
excavated to nearly their present depth, Yet even between
them and the people of the Neolithic or Surface Stone Period
there appears to he a great gulfa chapter of unwritten history,
which at present we have no means of reading.
Let us now return to the river-drift, and see what more it can
teach us. I have told you how on the high ground where now
is Southampton Common there are beds of gravel containing
water-worn flint implements, and that these beds must in all pro-
bability have been deposited in the bottom of a river valley.
Farther south we find gravels of a similar character, but at
lower levels, forming cliffs of no great height along the sea-shore
from Hambley to Alverstoke. These cliffs are now being eaten
away by the action of the sea, and among the pebbles spread by
the waves upon the shore numerous well-wrought implements
have been found, while farther east, at Selsey, there are extensive
drift-beds containing remains of the mammoth. Nor are traces
of the river, which deposited these beds, wanting on the other
side of Spitbead, for in the shingle at Bembridge implements of
the same kind have been discovered, and Mr. Codrington found
a good specimen, some 80 feet above the present sea-level, in
gravel on the Foreland at the east end of the Isle of Wight.
It will probably be some little strain upon your powers of
imagination for you mentally to fill up the great channel of the
sea which we know as Southampton Water, and which now
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
forms the basis of the prosperity of this town, and to picture
to yourselves a river flowing in the same direction, spreading
out gravels along its changing course at a height considerably
above the present sea-level, and yet having its shores frequented
by that early race of men who fashioned the implements which
we find in the gravels. But I shall have to make a still further
demand upon your powers of belief.
I have already spoken to you about the drift-deposits along
the valley of the Avon, but I mu t now take you a little farther
west, and call your attention to discoveries which have been
Made at Bournemouth. There, as many of you no doubt
remember, the cliffs are formed of beds of sand and clay belong-
ing to a period a little older, geologically speaking, than the
Bracklesham beds wheh form the subsoil of Southampton.
These cliffs are, however, capped with gravel ; and in this, also,
at a height of more than 120 feet above the sea-level, implements
have been found. Farther -east, near Boscombe, the height of
the gravel is still about 120 feet; at Hengistbury Head it is 90
feet; and at Barton and Hordle, where numerous implement*
have been fuutd, it is 60 or 70 feet. There can, indeed, be but

360 years ago^Martin Luther, by his reform of the Church in its
head aid member?, introduced a new era in the history of
civilisation, so in our cays has Charles Darwin, by his reform of
the doctrine of development, constrained the whole perception,
thought, and volition of mankind into new and higher courses.
It is true that personally, both in his character and influence,
Darwin has more affinity to the meek and mild Melanchlhon
than to the powerful and inspired Luther. In the .scope and im-
portance, how ever, of their great work of reformation, the two
cases were entirely parallel, and in both the success marks a new
epoch in the development of the human, mind.
Consider, first, the irrefragable fact of the unexampled success
which Darwin's reform of science has achieved in the short space
of twenty-three years! For never before since the beginning of
human science has any new theory penetrated so deeply to the
foundation of the whole domain of knowledge or so deeply
affected the most cherished personal convictiens of individual
students; never before has a new theory called forth such
vehement opposite n and so completely overcame it in such short
time. The depicture of the astounding revolution which Darwin
bas accomplished in the minds of men in their entire view of
nature and conception of the world will form an interesting
chapter in the future history of the doctrine of development.

whole theory as the " harmless dream of a man napping," while
another compared it with table-turning and "Odic force."
A celebrated botanist maintained that there was not one single

its consequences. Nay, no further back than five years ago,

tut also in the peculiarly favourable outward circumstances in
which they entere I the scientific world. Not the least of these
favourable conditions lies in the rare characteristic qualities of
the man on who u devolved the solution of such a gigantic task.
Charles Darwin united in himself a wealth of diverse intellectual
gifts which generally are to be found oily apart. His fund of
knowledge and his acumen as a naturalist were just as great as
his far-sightedness and comprehensiveness as philosopher. To
what degree he harrnoni >u.ly combined these two sides of
intellectual activity, often in conflict with each other, may be
inferred from the fact that many shortsighted experimen-
talists see in him only the conscientious observer and inge-
nious experimentalist, regretting that his theory should be
1/iit speculative aberration; while on the other hand many high
a piring thinkers look down with great depreciation on his
experimental achievements, but admire the acuteness of his
judgment and the lucidity of his logical train of thought. In
this respect he reminds us of our two greatest German naturi-
1 -ts, Jobannes Miiller and Carl Ern>t Haer. If the latter in his
title-page described his classical "History of the Develop-
ment of Animal.'' as "Observation and Reflection," Darwin
might say the same of all his works. With these rare powers of
observation and judgment were associated other noble qualities of
character greatly enhancing their value and profit; indefatigable
perseverance in the pursuit of his aims, scrupulous conscientious-

ness in grouping the assured results, purest aspiration after
natural truth, and open simplicity in communicating his conclu-
sions. No less praiseworthy was the extraordinary modesty
with which he set forth his views, and the mild meekness with
which, while answering all the sharp objections of his opponents,
s ' far as they were to the purpose, he simply ignored personal
aspers'ons.
Truly admirable is the pati-'nee and forethought with which
Darwin t;ok in hand and carried out the weightiest task of his
lifethe explanation of the origin of animal and vegetable
rp-cies through natural selection. The first basis to this
work was laid in his twenty-third year, when in 1S32, in
South America, he drew uo ge ^graphical and palre ontological
observations on the animal species of this continent. The rich
observations he accumulated in that voyage round the world, a
voyage lasting five years, and of such consequence to him, did
not, however, come to their full utilisation till long afterwards.
The injury to his health wr night by the severe hardships to
which that voyage subjected him forced him to withdraw com-
pletely from the restle-s turmoil of London, and to reduce his

placed than ourselves. Darwin was perfectly well aware of all
this; though his knowledge of our language and literature was
defective, as he often complained, yet he had the highest apprecia-
tion of onr intellectual treasures.
Darwin having in his great work of 1859, planting the basis of
his doctrine, said nothing regarding its anthropological conse-
quences, and having with wise reserve maintained silence on this
subject down to the year 1871, it was for me of the highest
interest, even as early as my first visit to him in 1866, to con-
verse with him at large on that topic As was to be expected,
the great thinker felt not the slightest misgiving in recognising
the necessary extension to man of the application of his doc-
trine of filiation. 1 had, therefore, the highest satisfaction in
being able to set forth to him the first genealogical tables which
1 had then designed, and in all e-sential points to receive his
approval. Though the special study of comparative anatomy
and ontogeny, on which I based my phylogenetic plans, lay out
of Darwin's province, he yet completely perceived their import-
ance. In his celebrated work, in two volumes, on the "Descsnt
of Man and Selection in relation to Sex" (1871), he has, therefore,
declared himself to be in all principal points in harmony with me,

and has expressly emphasised the importance in relation to the
history of filiation of the numerous animal hereditary relics
we [OS-ess in our human vertebrate organism.
If now we survey the huge mass of facts which in this and
other works Darwin has gathered together with just as much
forethought as boldness to serve as a support for his ideasif
we regard the innumerable observations and experiments he has
himself instituted to establish their accuracy, we cannot but
wonder at the strength of the giant-mind which has ama<sed
sucb an abundance of knowledge and power, of experimental
knowledge and philosophical science in the narrow compass of
a single human life. Involuntarily we exclaim what a rare con-
stellation of happy circumstances there must have been to render
possible such extraordinary performance conjoined with com-
mensurate succes-.
We must then, undoubtedly, admit that in the case of Darwin,
merit and fortune went hand in hai.d, and that rare favour on
the part of fate made it possible for him to execute completely
his great life-task. Free from all the cares and worries of a

elation-stone of knowledge, and endeavoured to discover a natural
common original basis of all things. This conscious aspiration
after absolute causality, after ihe unifying knowledge of a
common cosmic cause, appears all the more admirable that proper
experimental investigation of nature was at that time quite out of
the question.
Perhaps the most important among these Ionian natural philo-
sophers was Anaximander. He assumes that out of infinity of
matter through eternal revolution numerous world-bodies came
into being as condensations of the air, and that the earth,
too, as one of these world-bodies, issued out of a state origi-
nally fluid and afterwards aeriform. He con-equently anticipated
the fundamental conception, valid at this day, of the natural
development of the \\ orld, which 2400 years subsequently, in 1755.
our greatest German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, in his "Uni-
versal History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens," universally
established. As here in the cosmological killed }m, Anaximander
appears as forerunner of Kant and Laplace, so also at the same time
in the biological kingdom he prophetically prefigures Lamarck
and Darwin. For according to him the earliest living creatures
on this globe originated in water through the operation of

the sun. From these creatures, later on, were developed the
land-inhabiting plants and animals which left the water and
adapted themselves to life on dry land. Man, likewise, has
gradually worked himself up from animal organisms, and, in
reality, from fish-like aquatic animals.
If here to our surprise we find clearly enunciated some of the
most important fundamental conceptions of our current theory of
development, we recognise it still more distinctly in its integrity
one hundred years later in Heraclites of Ephe-us. He it was
who first propounded the principle that a great uninterrupted
process of development prevades the whole universal world,
that all forms are involved in an everlasting current, and that
struggle is "the father of all things." Seeing that nowhere in
the world exists absolute rest, and that all standingstill is but
apparent, we are compelled everywhere to assume a perpetual
change of matter, a constant variation of firm. That is only
possible, however, through the fact that one form thrusts out the
other, and that the new violently usurps the place of the old; or,
in oilier words, through the universal "struggle for existence."
This principle of nature set forth by Heraclites that everlasting
movement or the struggle among all things is the fundamental
agent of the world received a much deeper interpretation a little
later in Empedocles of Agrigent in Sicily. He, too, assumes an
uninterrupted change of phenomena, but finds the universal
fundamental cause of the everlasting universal struggle in the

two c mnteracting princ'ples of hate and love, or, as our modern
physics expresses it, of the attraction and repulsion of parts.
As the mixture of bodies is effected by love so is their separation
by hate. If in the present day we regard the attraction and
repulsion of atoms as the ultimate ground of all phenomena we
find, then, this fundamental proposition of our modern doctrine of
atoms already anticipated in Empedocles. It is however still
more remarkable that Empedocles makes the purposive forms
of organisms come into existence through the accidental con-
junction of counteracting forces. Out of this great struggle the
living forms now existing have issued victoriously because
they were best prepared for the battle, and therefore most
capable of life. Here we have not only the fundamental con-
ception of Darwin's theory of selection forestalled, but also the
solution of the great riddle indicated, "How can organic forms
constituted for a particular purpose come into existence in a
purely mechanical way without the co-operation of a final cause
acting with a particular purpose ?"the same riddle the solution
of which we account to be Darwin's highest philosophical merit.
Among all the great philosophers of classical antiquity, the
three we have already named, Anaximander, Heraclites, and

common property. We will therefore on this occasion expound
only that point which for us to-day is of quite peculiar interest,
and has at the same time been very variously conceived, the
question, namely, how far the general theory of nature
held by our greatest poet agrees with Darwin's. In 1866
ii my "General Morphology" I placed Goethe and
Jjunarck side by side with Darwin as the most important of
the founders of the theory of fili ition, and in the way of evidence
had compiled from their writings a great number of specially
remarkable passages. Their number has lately been increased
by others. In the case, however, of a universal genius like
Goethe, the question depends far less on the number and form
of particular passages in which he communicates his view of the
"formation and transformation of organic natures" as on the
whole spirit of his grand and thoroughly monistic theory of
nature, and on this subject those who have a general knowledge
and comprehension of G >ethe cannot now entertain any doubt.
In that valuable legacy entitled "God and the World" he his
left us in superabundance a collection of confessions as perfectly
beautiful in their form as they are significant in their substance.
The preface to the-e confessions, the Proem, at once ex-

p-esses the fundamental monistic thought of Goethe's general
view of nature, the i isepirable unity of Nature and God, in a
manner which leaves us in no doubt:
"Was war" ein Gott, der nur von aussen sticsse,
Im Kreis das All am Finger taufen Hesse!
Ihm ziemt's, die Welt L-n Innem z 1 bewegen,
Natur in Si- U. Sich in Natur zu hegen.
So dass was in Ihm lebt und webt und ist, Nie Seine Kraft, nie Seinen Geist ver-nisst I**1
Consider, in addition, the following wonderful poems: "The
World-Soul," "One and All," "Legacy," "Parabase," "Epirrhema," &c.; consider, moreover, his pronounced con-
fession to Spinoza's doctrine, and we cannot really find any
c -er.tial divergence from our current monistic comprehension of
tie world as newly established by Darwin. And what a high
value Goethe himself attaches to it is seen in his question: 
"Was kann der Mensch in Leben raehr gewinnen
Als dass sich Gott-Natur ihm offenbare,
Wie sie das Feste lasst *u Geist verrinnen. Wie sie das Geiiterzeugte fest bewahre ?" 3
That, accordingly, our great Prince of Poets considered the
world only as a moni tic process of development in the sense of
t ic Hellenic philosophy of nature, is further demonstrated, a along
other passages, by the dialogue between Thales and Anaxagoras
in the Classical Walpurgu-Night. We would also point out the emphasis with which in geology he held fast to the theory of
a gradual and uninterrupted development of our planet and its
mountains. From the very beginning he was the most decided
opponent of the fallacy of repeated violent revolutions in our
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
globe, a fallacy which developed itself in the beginning of our
century, and through Cuvier, in particular, came to be gene-
rally accepted. "The violence and leaps in this doctrine," he
said, "I cannot away with, for they are not in accordance with
nature. Be the matter as it will, it must stand written, that I
curse this confounded hurly-burly apparatus of the new creation
of the world. And, assuredly, a talented young man will yet
arise with the courage to oppose this universal craze!" Only
a few years passed till this expectation was fulfilled. For in
1830 appeared Darwin's like-minded countryman, the great
geologist, Charles I.yell, and delivered his continuity-theory, the
doctrine which is now universally received, of the gradual and
uninterrupted development of the earth from natural causes, a
mechanical geological theory which, perfectly in Goethe's sense, excluded all violent revolutions of the earth from supernatural causes.
If here in the province of geology Goethe shows himself as a
most decided adherent to a monistic theory of development, we
find him much more so in the province of biology. For the
knowledge of the living substance, this "precious, glorious
thing" was truly his peculiar pet-study. Here, especially in
Morphology, his " Doctrine of Forms," he has cast glances into
the inner origin and birth of organic forms, glances deep and

\ the development series of the other vertebrates is indicated
1 special clearness in his comparison of the human skull with
of lower mammals. He here expressly points out several
places in the human skull as remains of the animal skull "which
found in stronger proportions in such a low organisation, but
have not quite disappeared in man, in spite of his elevation."
No less does his celebrated discovery of the intra-maxillary bone
testify to the same conviction. Man, like the other mammals,
having cutting teeth must also, Goethe concluded,-possess the inn-a-
xillary bone which showed it-elf in the other mammals; and
joint of fact after the most careful anatomical investigations
established his point, although it had been disputed by the
highest anatomical authorities.
Highly remarkable, moreover, in this respect is the agreement
Goethe expresses with the kindred view of Kant in his "Critique
ihe Faculty of Judgment," a work the "great main thoughts
which were entirely analogous with his own work, action, and
<ught hitherto." The great Konigsberg philosopher had
enunciated the descent of all organic beings from a common
original mother (from man down to polyp) as a'hypothesis
lich "alone was in harmoi.y with the principle of the

xhanism of Nature, without which a Science rf Ara/ure was altogether impossible." This theory of de-cent, however, he had at the
Tie lin.e called "a daring adven'ure of reason.' In reference
this passage Goethe remarks: "Had I first urconsciouslyd in obedience to inward impulse re-tlesly pressed forward in
e direction of that Original Form, that Typehad I even
cceeded in building up a set erne conformable with Nature;
now at lengih c.uld nothing hinder me from boldly main'aining
e Adventure of Reason, as the sire of Konigsberg calls it."
Finally, nothing can more strongly show the extraordinary
terest with which Goethe followed this transformation-theory,
>wntotheend of his life, than the well-known atention he
gave to the dispute between Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier.
"This event is for me of altogether incredible importance,"
(claims ihe grey-headed old man of eigh'.y-one years, with
youthful fire, "and I have a right to jubilate over the universal
victory, at last witnessed, of a cause to which I have devoted my
holtlife, and which, too, is mine in a quite especial manner."
The vivid representations of this most significant dispute, completed by Gcethe in March, 1832, just a few days before his
death, i the la-t literary legacy the greatest poet and thinker of
the German nation has left behind him; and to this great intel-
sctual contention also his last word applies, "more light."
It is deeply to be regretted that the "Philosophic Zoolo-
gique," by Lamarck, a work of the highest moment which
appeared in 1809, was wholly unknown to Goethe. For just in
the development theory of this work, which is quite differently
arranged and strictly systematically composed, he would have

oundmuch that was wanting to himself, much that would have
.ielded hitn the most complete supplement for his own incom-
plete studies. In reference as much to the monistic and com-
plete elaboration of the development theory as to the many-sided
experimental establishment of it on fact, the great work of Jean
Lamarck is much more important than the similar essays of all
his contemporaries, more particularly of the like-named work of
GeoffroySt. Hilaire. When one considers with what extraordinary
interest Goethe took up the latter work, it may be concluded
that he would have given a much warmer reception still to the
rich-thoughted work of Lamarck.
We cannot I ut rrgard it as a truly tragic fact, that the " Philo-
sophie Zonlogique" by Lamarck, one of the greatest productions
of the great literary period in the beginning of our century, met,
from its outset, with but extremely little attention, and in the
course of a few years was utterly forgotten. Not till Darwin
fifty years later on breathed new life into the Transformation
theory therein established, was the buried treasure again brought
into the light of day, and we cannot row bat describe it as the
completest representation of the theory of development prior to
tne time of Darwin. Nay, it seems to us the necessary atonement

insufficiency of the stock of observations and experiments he
brought forward in proof of his far-reaching principles. For
then, as now, the great majority of naturalists want, above
everything, to have palpable facts in the hand. Then as now
we find the par&doxical.phenomenon, that the great majority of
people accept without any misgiving and trample under foot the
most absurd hypothe-es and dogmas, while on the other hand
they encounter well-founded scientific theories with the more
suspicion and opposition the more they approach the truth.
Among the experimental proofs of theories, moreover, to most
people those are not the most welcome which are furnished by
a continuous series of phenomena and a whole large class of facts.
What they most desire is the particular observation, the single
experiment. A large part of Darwin's immense success is due
to the fact that he brought into the field to a truly overwhelming
amount exactly such particular pertinent observations and ex-
periments. Poor Lamarck on the contrary, trusting to the logical
conclusion-drawing faculty of naturalists, for the most part
neglected the business of palpable particulars.

natural science was most powerfully and comprehensively
revealed is of high interest, for all three are very different
among themselves both in respect of their general genius and
the fortunes of their life outwardly and inwardly, as also, very
especially, in respect of their courses of study and the ways by
which they pursued their high aims. Lamarck starts from the
most careful special studies of individual animal and vegetable
forms, and by his many years' systematic examination and com-
parison of them is brought to the conviction that all living and
fossil species have developed themselves out of a few simple
common geneological forms. Goethe arrives at the same con-
clusion on the ground of his general studies in comparative
morphology, directed by the conviction that the unity of the
common type or the hereditary protoform can be traced out,
everywhere in all the different organic forms, however manifoldly
they may be transformed in individuals through adaptation to
outward circumstances. Darwin, finally, first answers to his own
satisfaction the question by what causes the new culture-forms of
animals and plants reared by men come into being, and then
demonstrates that the struggle for existence is the same cause
which in like manner by the inter-action of adaptation and
inheritance constantly produces new organic species in the free
state of nature.
In these wholly different ways and by application of wholly
different methods of investigation, all these three naturalists
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
arrive ultimately at the same conclusionto the acceptance,
namely, of a monistic and continuous development of the whole
of organic nature, through the operation alone of natural causes,
to the exclusion of all supernatural creative miracles. All three,
however, being at the same time deep-thinking philosophers and
keeping constantly in their eye the unity of the whole world of
phenomena, their idea of development expands to a grand
pantheistic conception of the world, to that doctrine of 01 eness
which forms the essence of our current monistic theory of
nature.
The immeasurable effect which the decided triumph of this
monistic view of nature already in this day exercises on all pro-
vinces of human knowledge, an effect increa-ing in geome-
trical progression from year to year, opens to us the happiest
prospect regarding the further intellectual and moral develop-
ment of mankind. 1 repeat here my firm personal conviction
that in future this progress of scientific knowledge will be
esteemed the greatest turning-point in the intellectual history of
man.

ppears as but efflux of one and the same all comprehensive law
>f nature. The great law of the conservation of force thereby
inds its universal amplication, embracing alo those biological
provinces which hitherto appeared closed to it.
In face of the surprising velocity with which in these last
years the development theory has paved an entrance into the most
diverse departments of inquiry we may here express the hope
that its high pedagogic value also will be even more recognised,
and that it "ill quite perfect the education of the coming gene-
rations. When five years ago, at the fiftieth Meeting of Naturalists
in Munich, I laid stress on the high significance of the develop-
ment theory in relation to educa'ion, my remarks were so misunder-
stood that a few words of explanation may here lie allowed me.
It stands to reason that with these words I could not mean to
claim that Darwinism should be taught in ele uentary schools.
That is simply impossible. For ju-t like the higher mathe-
matics and physics, or thehistory of philosophy, Darwinism demands
a mass of previous knowledge which can be acquired only in the
higher stages of learning. Assuredly, however, we may demand that
all subjects of education be treated according to thegmitie method,
and that the fundamental idea of the development-theory, the

Causality of Phenomena, find everywhere its acknowledgment.
We are firmly persu.ided that by this means, thinkin^and judging
conformably with nature w.ll be promoted in far greater measure
than by any other method.
At the same time through this extended application of the de-
velopment-doctrine, one of the greatest evils of our day in the
culture of youth will be removedthe cramming of the memory,
we mean, with dead lumber, which smothers the best powers and
prevents both soul and body from coming to a normal develop-
ment. This excessive cramming is based on the old fundamental
ineradicable error that the quantity of factual knowledge is the
bes.t measure of culture, while, in truth, culture depends on the
quality of causative science. We would therefore deem it espe-
cially useful that the selection of the material of instruction be
much more carefully made, and that in making the selection,
those departments which cram the memory with masses of dead
facts do not receive the preference, but those which cul.ivate the
judgment through the living stream of the development idea.
Lei our worried school youth only learn half as much, but let
them understand this half more thoroughly, and the next genera-
tion will in soul and body be doubly as sound as the present.
In the most gladdening manner these requirements are being
met by the reforms which are simultaneously in process of
accomplishment in the most diverse provinces of science. Every-

One species refeired by him to Stee .strup's genus Architeuthis,

beach, it was not quite dead; the longer arms measured twenty-
five feet ; the blades had a row of fifteen suckers along each side
and a middle row of nineteen. The smaller arms were about
eleven feet nine inches, with a width of seven and a half inches.
They were furnished with suckers and fleshy tubercles, but these
shorter arms were of unequal length. The fleshy membrane
connecting these was about eleven inches deep. The head was
four feet three inches in circumference, the eyes five inches by

between three and four years, during most of which time he has
been on the Lower Congo. From the staiion which be e-ta-

road past the long line of cataracts, about 150 miles, to Stanley
Pool. Much of the road has, we understand, been constructed,

jrimj the region lying between the Lower Congo and the
Ogove, and have already done much to clear up its hydro-
iphy.
Baron NordenskjoLD has under consideration an expedi-
m to the Arctic next summer, and is engaged, in company
with Mr. William Schonlanck, of Berlin, a gentlemen much
interested in geographical discovery, who is at present visiting
Stockholm, as to the detailed arrangements of the same.
The Swedish Geological Expedition returned from Spitz-
:rgen to Tromso in the yacht Bojna on the 16th inst. It was

to tremendous teas.
We regret to hear of the death of Mr. Krarup Smith, who
has, since 1867, been Inspector of the Northern Districts in
Danish Greenland. During the past winter he suffered from
constant sleeplessness, and he expired somewhat suddenly on
May 28, aged forty-nine. Every traveller who has passed any
time at Godhavn during the last fifteen years has spoken of the
kindness and attention of Mr. Smith and his wife. He ren-
ercd important services to various Arctic expeditions, and freely
placed his house and resources at the disposal of scientific
¦orkersNares, Markham, Hayes P&vy, Whymper, Nor-
enskjbld, Steenstrup, and many others of various nationalities
have experienced their hospitality or received their assi-tance.

Llthough Inspector Smith was not of a robust constitution, he
travelled extensively by boat and sledge in summer and winter
throughout the Inspectorate, which extends over more than five
ej.rees of latitude, and took much interest in the welfare of the
natives, who sustain a real loss by his lamented death.
The range of the changes of level in the rivers of Russia in
Europe has become, since 1876, the subject of accurate measure-
nents, and M. Tillo has just published in the Russian Nautical
ieview (Morskoy Sbornik) an interesting paper on this subject,
being the result of measurements made at eighty different places.
The highest range is reached by the Oka at Kaluga, the difference
between the highest and lowest levels being as much as 45 feet;
the average range for the some river from its source to its mouth

nouth is 33'6 feet, 30*1 feet for the Kama, 25M2 for the Duna,

20 feet. Of course this range diminishes very much towards the
nouth of each river; but still it reaches 12 feet for the Volga at
Astrakhan, and 9 feet for the Duna at Riga. The highest range
observed in the lakes of Northern Russia was only 21 feet. A

FLUIDS
Experimental Researches into the Properties and Motions
of Fluids with Theoretical Deductions therefrom. By
W. F. Stanley. (London: E. and F. N. Spon, 1882.)
I "HE aim and general scope of this work is well
¦*¦ described in its modest and explicit preface. It is
essentially a tentative and qualitative treatise, the author
expressing a wish in his preface that some highly educated
mathematician who may care to follow him, will clothe
with his skill the rude, but as he believes, natural under-
lying forms he has brought in some cases to light.
Modesty such as this, undoubtedly tends to disarm criti-
cism, but after a careful perusal of the work, we cannot
help cherishing a sincere regret that the author does not
himself happen to be the much desired mathematician.
We feel certain that if this had been the case, many
mistakes would have been avoided, much speculation
curtailed, and the value of the work considerably enhanced.
Thus while the author admits that " the eighth chapter is
very incomplete on certain points for want of suffi.ient
research into the works of others and more experiment,"
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:13 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
we find the work characterised throughout by a lack of
the same knowledge of what is already known, or has
been done by others.
Too often also the deductions appear to have been
preconceived, and the experiments from which they are
supposed to follow are either too rough, or of too special
a nature.
As the author speaks disparagingly of his own educa-
tional acquirements, it would be unfair perhaps to criticise
too harshly a literary style, which certainly detracts very
much from the pleasure or comfort of studying his work.
He might, however, have tried to be a little more clear,
and somewhat less pedantic in the construction of his
sentences. Almost every idea has to be disinterred from
a heap of polysyllabic adjectives and adverbs, which most
effectually obscure its meaning, while very often we meet
with paragraphs of, at any rate at first sight, a most
incomprehensible character. Such as the following:
"Such equilibrium acts as a condensation upon the
surface of a liquid, thereby increasing the molecular
surface density," or " the area of efflux of the liquid will
be the mean of the directive impulses of vertical and
horizontal pressures." Elsewhere he speaks of " a narrow
vacuous plane" and "motive quiescence."
On the other hand there is much that is novel and
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
worth perusal in the book, more especially in Chapters
IV., V., VI., and VII., and in Section III. on waves.
One very prominent fault which we notice all through
the work, is the almost entire absence of any distinction
between the physical properties of compressible and in-
compressible fluids. The words fluid and liquid are used
quite indifferently, and whatever principles the author
deduces for water, are immediately and without trial
assumed to be true for air and gases, and vice versd.
Again, the experiments which are mostly of a very simple
and rudimentary character, are not sufficiently diffe-
rential. Thus in experiments on liquids, water alone is
employed, and in like manner air is the sole representative

of the gaseous state, though in a work dealing with fluids
generally, one might have expected to hear something at
least of the properties of all the more easily procurable
gases and liquids.
The first three chapters deal with the theory of the
constitution and motive properties of fluids, and are, as
the author admits in his preface, " speculative and even

water, would the author thinks, be impossible were the
surface tensile. Doubtless, according to the author's
definition of tensile, it would be so, but we think it would
be equally impossible unless the surface were endowed
with a tolerably high tension, such as water is known to
possess.
We find it impossible also to accept the author's ex-
planation of the various capillary phenomena on the
same hypothesis. To take the case of capillary elevation
and depression alone. If the surface force on a liquid
is extensile, it can be easily shown by reversing the
reasoning given in the ordinary physical text-books, that
in the case of capillary elevation, the free surface would
be convex, and in the case of capillary depression, con-
cave, conditions, precisely the opposite of those which
actually take place. The same hypothesis is equally un-
successful when applied to the resolution of jets into
drops. Mr. Stanley considers drops to be formed when
the mass cohesion of a jet is equal to the extensibility of
its surface, and in order to show that this is the principal
cause, he falls into the serious error of imagining that a
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:13 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
jet of liquid (water is the only one mentioned) issuing
from a small orifice, continually expands in sectional area
beyond the vena contracta, whether the stream be directed
upwards or downwards, the final resolution into drops
being due to such expansion caused by extensibility.
We know, however, that this cannot be the case, since
although the jet expands slightly beyond the vena con-
tracta, in accordance with the equation of continuity it
again contracts if flowing downwards, and the reverse if
flowing upwards, and since in either case, whether in
waterfalls or fountains, the jet ultimately becomes con-
verted into spray, the author's explanation is obviously
erroneous. It is to be regretted for many reasons that in
dealing with this interesting though difficult subject of
surface tension and capillarity of liquids Mr. Stanley
makes no mention of the researches of Van der Mens-
brugghe, Tomlinson, Duclaux, or of the very remarkable
results obtained not long ago by Cintolesi, and that
while the names of Young and Laplace are mentioned
once, not the smallest account is given of their researches
Chapter III. chiefly relates to the conditions of the
efflux of liquids through orifices. A great deal of it is
almost unintelligible from the obscurity of the language
employed, and the loose way in which the expressions,
energy, weight, velocity, force, and volume are employed

as though they were identical.
As far as it is possible to glean anything definite from
such a chaos, it would seem that the author thinks the
known contraction which takes place in the area of efflux
of a liquid through a vent, is due to horizontal elastic
compressions caused by the reaction of the vessel against
the pressure of the liquid it contains. No reference is
made to the Torricellian equation, which according to the
author's notation should take the form t/a = i,gh\ instead
of 2g h as ordinarily; or to the theoretical results got
with different forms of orifices on the parallel section
hypothesis. We do not think the author has got on the
right tack here. The horizontal velocities which must
necessarily arise, either from the natural or artificial
narrowing of the descending column, and which are dis-
regarded by the parallel section hypothesis, may be readily
conceived to act so as to contract the area of vertically
descending liquid, and not elastic compressions, which have little place in the dynamics of a practically incompressible liquid.
In Chapter IV. the author tries to show that theg^r
relative motion of fluids on solid surfaces or in other fluids is effected by means of rolling contact. The hypothetical case of a plane supported on equal rollers, and movit;
a parallel plane is taken, and the analogy to this pointed out in different cases, such as where a river moving relatively to its bank causes small lateral eddies, or where larger rotatory movements are produced in the bat

not very obvious manner, by means of certain backward
forces arising from induced whirl-systems. Whether
some small portion of the phenomenon may not be due
to an induced reflex action, is a point worthy of investiga-
tion, but the major portion is generally admitted to be
due to a principle with which, the author, since he entirely
omits all reference to it, is apparently unfamiliar, viz. that
the pressure both of compressible and incompressible
fluids is diminished by an increase of velocity. A con-
clusion drawn by the author from an experiment on p.
276 is similarly invalidated by the omission of the same
principle.
The way in which fluid moves in pipes or channels is
described in Chapter VII., and is concluded to be by
rolling contact on a continuous system of lateral whirl-
rings, " these being alternately collected by reflex action,
that converts these whirls into loops, which permit the
deflected fluid to re-enter (in a hypercycloidal curve) the
central system by traction."
The same principle of rolling contact and the develop-
ment of whirl-systems is, in Chapter VIII., applied to the

motions of solids through fluids, more particularly of
ships, through water. The eddies, for example, which we
ordinarily observe at the rear of boats are regarded by
Mr. Stanley, not as resulting from the meeting of two
relatively opposed currents, but as friction rollers engen-
dered by the passage of the body through the liquid.
The general effects of rudders on the motion of ships,
and the peculiar cases noticed by Prof. Osborne Reynolds
and others, are ascribed to the position and influence of
such whirls, and not to the mere deflection of stream
lines. Although a good deal of what the author says on
this point is, as he admits himself in the preface, very
speculative, and though the theoretical action from which
it all proceeds is not very plain, there is much that is
suggestive and worthy of study.
Section II. is devoted to a consideration of Oceanic
and Aerial Systems of Circulation, which are assumed to
be gigantic whirl systems arising from the projection of
water within quiescent water, or against solid areis of re-
sistance such as capes and promontories. A good deal
of the matter usually found in treatises on physical geo-
graphy is here reproduced, as to the general forces in
action to disturb equilibrium, but in the case of general
oceanic circulation, too much importance is, we think,
attached to the thermal causes of circulation discussed

by Lenz and Dr. Carpenter, and too little notice taken of
the effect of prevailing winds in causing at least superficial
ocean currents. Nothing very fresh is adduced in ex-
planation of the causes of the currents as they are at pre-
sent known. The main currents, such as the Atlantic
equatorial, are assumed to exist, and all the author does,
is to try and arrange them as large circles or whirls to
suit his whirl theory, and which please the eye just in
proportion as they diverge from the truth and irregularity
of nature.
We do not doubt that the currents occasionally take the
form of whirls such as those exhibited by the author, since
their deflection by continents and the continuity of the
circulation, requires the water to flow more or less in
closed curves, but we cannot agree with the author's view
that the Southern Polar drift current is simply a huge
whirl, set spinning round by the tangential forces exerted
by the whirl systems of the South Atlantic and South
Pacific. We prefer the simpler and more rational view
that it is a result of the constant and similarly directed
wind system of that region. Another view indulged in

NATURE
Altogether we are not favourably impressed with this
part of the work, and do not deem it likely to accom-
plish the author's forecast in his preface, viz. "aid in the
elevation of the sciences of physical geography and
meteorology, now sciences of observation, to sciences of
principle."
The last part of the work, treating of aqueous surface-
waves, which we have not space to notice in detail, is a
considerable improvement on the foregoing chapters.
We are surprised, however, to see that while some notice
is taken of the researches of M. Flaugergues and Mr. J.
Scott Russell, no reference is made to those of the late
Mr. Froude.
In conclusion, the type and illustrations are decidedly
good, and though we cannot describe it otherwise than as
a preliminary investigation into certain portions of the
dynamics of certain fluids, accompanied by a good deal
of speculation and deduction which still requires verifica-
tion, and which is sometimes palpably erroneous, it never-
theless represents a very laudable, and to some extent
successful endeavour on the part of the author to fill up

HANDBOOK OF INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY
Handbook of Invertebrate Zoology for Laboratories and
Sea-side Work. By W. K. Brooks, Ph.D. (Boston,
1882.)
THE series of notes and directions issued under this
title by Mr. Brooks, of the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, Baltimore, is an interesting evidence of the progress
which the practical study of zoology is making in Ameri-
can universities, and more especially of the valuable
services which the Baltimore University is rendering to
education in science. The book consists of brief notes
describing the appearances of a series of invertebrate
animals before and during successive stages of dissection
or development, as the case may be. Diagrammatic
sketches (for the most part original, or copied with a few
original touches from English authors) are introduced
into the text. The animals chosen by Mr. Brooks are
the following :¦Amoeba, Paramecium, Vorticella, Sycan-
dra (Calcispongia;), Eucope (Leptomedusa;), Mnemopsis
(Anthomedusse), Asteracanthion, Arbacia (Echinid),
Lumbricus, Macrobdella (Hirudinean), Callinectes (Bra-
chyurous Decapod Crustacean), Cyclops, Acridium
(Orthoptera), Anodonta, Loligo.

Concerning each of these forms the reader will find
original remarks and often detailed observations illustrated
by sketches. At the same time the writer does not pretend
to offer us a series of monographs, but merely such notes
as will be eminently serviceable to students in the labora-
tory. It is no doubt to American students and especially
to Mr. Brooks's own pupils that this work will be useful.
Such descriptions as that of the development of Arbacia,
and those relating to the Medusas, have their value im-
mensely increased when it is possible to place in the
hands of the student the identical materialor perhaps
we should say the counterpart of that materialwhich
has served for the preparation of the descriptions which
re to guide the student's observation.
Though class-students in this country will not gain
much assistance from Mr. Brooks's notes, professed zoo-
logists will be interested in his treatment of the stt
and may glance with advantage at the more &zl
sections, such as that on the Lamellibranch gill, k

upper boundary, the stars 7 and $ of the Great Bear, and nearly
touched by its lower fringe the star Cor Caroli; this gives some

A bright aurora was seen here last evening (October 2).
When first observed, at 7.0 p.m., the arc in the north-west was
very distinct; at the same time two cloud-like patches of light
were seen in the north-east at an elevation of about 30°. At
7.10 the display reached its greatest brilliancy, narrow streamers
extending upwards from the arc, as frequent intervals ; several
pale flashes of light taking place over the arc. At this time the
light patches had been replaced by others, and several new ones
had appeared rapidly, the whole series forming a large arc
springing from the east-north-east point, and extending towards
the west-south-west, at 7.20 nearly forming a complete arch.
By 7.30 the sky had become much overcast; still the strong glow
continued in the north-west, while a lighting up of the clouds
indicated the continued occurrence of the light patches. At
9.30 the sky was clear againj and every trace of aurora had
vanished. The light of the aurora was quite colourless.

Last night, the 2nd inst., I here witnessed a very fine
specimen of the Aurora B01 talis. It was in the form of
radiating lines or ribs, having spaces between, equal to the
» idth of the ribs, namely, equal light and equal shadow; the
whole springing from a centre about 150 from the zenith in a
south-westerly direction. When I first perceived the light, at
6.45 p.m., it was faint and of the colour of moonlight, and was

Fifteen minutes later it had all disappeared, but at 7.15 it began
to flash out in different places like slow lightning, principally at
the zenith, much brighter than before, but still of the same
colour, and around the centre the light took the shape of a sort
of eccentric vortex ring. W. J. Lineham

About a quarter to seven this evening I became aware that
an aurora was in the sky. A clear, persistent light showed itself
near the northern horizon, whilst in the eastern sky fluctuating
luminous regions formed an arc between 7I1. and 7h. 15m. I
noticed the position of that arc with respect to the constellations
Aries and Pegasus. It began under o and $ Arietis, at about,
say, 50 north of the equator, and stretched parallel to a line through
y and a Pegasi, also at about 5° north of the equator. At times
the arc extended further towards the south-western horizon. At
about 7h. 30m. a remnant of the arc shot a ray diagonally to the
square formed by the four stars of Pegasus, i.e. from y to 0
Pegasi. The colour of the aurora was pale white in the northern
light; in the arc it was white, approaching slightly to a green
approximate to that of the magnesium light.

they in addition possess a really splendid series of illus-
trations, few will care to deny, and yet it must be difficult
for a student of the more modern school of biological
science to fairly appreciate them. The descriptive and
physiological portions of the first volume, despite the
quarter of a century spent by the author thereof in the
preparation of his work, are apt to excite one's surprise,
while the profound ignoring by Dr. Bowerbank of the
work of co-temporary authors, leaves the description of
the species in the second and third volumes often quite
delusive.
Those naturalists who can look back for some thirty
years or more will not find it difficult to account for all this. Leaving out of the question for the moment how

little was then known about sponges, how clumsy and un-
scientific were the attempts to examine them, it is more
important still to recollect how few were the opportunities
in these islands of scientific biological training. Which of
our universities gave any training in modern biological
research? and the anxious inquirer as to the beginnings of
life, as to the structure of its lower forms, as to the proper
method of such research, could find no voice crying in
the many colleges of our country.
Things have changed greatly since then, and the man
who at the period referred to might have been treated as
a master would now probably not be tolerated at all. The
late Dr. Bowerbank, though as a youth fond of astronomy,
chemistry, botany, and geology, received no scientific
education. A partner in an extensive business concern, he
amused his leisure hours with the pursuit of science as
an amateur; of an active and pleasant turn of mind, we
owe to him in great measure the origin of our Palaeonto-
graphical Society, of the Microscopical Society, and also
of the Ray Society.
In 1841 a storm occurring while he was at Brighton threw
a mass of sponges on the beach, and for the next thirty-five
years Dr. Bowerbank made the group of sponges his
favourite study. "He was a pioneer," writes his friend, the
editor of this volume, "who struck out a new line. As he
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
had begun alone, so he went on alone in his own way, not
so much disregarding as seldom or rarely noticing the views
of others." It is for this reason that hardly any synonyms
will be found in the previous volumes of this work;
indeed Dr. Bowerbank was in the habit of not even
referring back to his own predescribed species.
However differently the first three volumes of Bower-
bank's British Sponges may be regarded, all will agree
that this fourth volume is *Dne not only indispensable for
the correct understanding of its predecessors, but that the
editor's own special additions have made it a work that
must be in the hands of every student of this group.
Of the special editorial work we would notice the com-
plete list of species described in all the volumes, with
references so complete that it forms as it were a key to the
whole. The supplying of recent synonyms, though a most
laborious undertaking has been accomplished in a manner
to call for the warmest praise. The giving a table of geogra-

will have experienced an amount of diminution of velocity
at the perihelion passage on January 27, 1880, sufficient
to cause the last revolution to occupy only two years and
eight months, and which if experienced to the same
extent on the 17th of last month, may bring the comet
round again in October 1883.
The comet was perceived in the forenoon of September
18, at many places in the South of France, Spain,
Portugal, Italy, &c. From Nice we read:"Toute la

a very distinct nucleus, and a tail about 6° in length,

philosophy of rainfall, a "rain-band," or rain-predicting
spectroscope.
There are some persons who will persist in opening the
slits of their spectroscopes too wide, and obtaining
thereby, when they look at the light of the sky, only a
brilliant continuous spectrum of showy colours, or who
let the sun, or some strong light glance across the slit,
and can then see nothing satisfactorily. But all those
others who narrow down the slit almost to extinction,
and focus the eyepiece nicely to their own eye, looking
from a shaded corner out to a portion of the low, day
illumined sky in front of themall who in fact just do the
simply right and proper thing to begin with, have no
trouble in seeing, as they extend across the spectrum strip
of the daylight, besides the thin solar Fraunhofer lines,
and certain hazy lines and bands parallel thereto, and
depending on the absorption of the dry gases of our
atmospherethey all, I say, agree and acknowledge that
they can also see one, two, or three other bands, which
from their places amongst the colours and solar lines, are
known to be the spectroscopic imagings of watery vapour.

Hence among the recent discussions in the Times, the
Scotsman, and other daily or weekly papers, there was
practically no disputation that the spectroscope has the
faculty of showing the presence of the otherwise quite
invisible watery vapour in the atmosphere. But some of
the writers contended that it showed the fact either so
faintly, or so capriciously, that the method was of little
use even as a hygrometer; could only give deceptive
disheartening results in predicting the probable occur-
rence of rain, and must be looked on merely as one of a
number, and by no means the best, of " weather prog-
nostics.'' Is it worth while, therefore, to pursue the
method further?
If with the hope of overcoming the already formed
idiosyncratic prejudice of some one human mind, it is
not worth while. For there is nothing so easy for an
unwilling observer, as to ignore the nicety, and overlook
the precision of any quantitative spectroscopic observa-
tion; especially when this mode of employing the
instrument in our present inquiry has been loudly con-
demned in public under a depreciating name, which
would bring it into the same category as the herd-boy's
confident advice to Dean Swift: "Sir, when you see that
bull turn his tail to the hedge, then you may be sure it is
going to rain."

But we need not after all be offended at the mere
name of "prognostic;" for are there not prognostics
and prognostics in meteorology! What are not the
risings and fallings of the wind-compelling barometer
itself, but a weather prognostic for those who can inter-

another weather prognosticof a very grand and expen-

vivid idea of how rapidly the power of the air to hold
moisture in invisible suspension increases with the tem-
perature; and remember that it is not until the quantity
of watery vapour accumulates to a still greater extent
than what air of such temperature can assimilate, that
there is spare material enough for producing rainfall.
Hence, while in Scotland a rain-band of intensity marked
3 usually produces a little rain, and 3 produces much, yet
in Lisbon during the same months the so-called rain-
band, but really only water-vapour band, may mark 4,
and yet no rain fall. But with 5 or 6, the temperature
remaining the same, down rain will come even in that
usually arid country.
Again, whatever number of supernumerary observa-
tions any person may take, when his enthusiasm-fit is
upon him, he should never neglect his usual, regular
observation at a fixed hour, say 9 a.m. For if the wet-
bulb depression goes through a diurnal rise and fall
according to the hour, something of the same kind may
be looked for in the strength of the spectral water-vapour
band; though fortunately it is not so very marked a

are more constant in their composition from hour to hour,
than its lower beds in contact with earth and water.
But why should I go on wearying readers of NATURE
with these little details, when they can far better find out
such things for themselves, and often realise improve-
ments therein. See how well Mr. Rand Capron has
mastered the subject, in his " Plea for the Rain-band" in
Mr. Symon's Meteorological Magazine. How acutely
Colonel Donnelly appears to have detected in the second
water-vapour band of the spectrum, viz. that near the
solar C line (a darker part of the spectrum than that
occupied by the band near D, and therefore more difficult
to observe), an indicator of a different order of precipita-
tion from the atmosphere than ordinary rainfall. And
again I trust to be excused for mentioning here that my
friend, Mr. T. Glazebrook Rylands, has now accumulated
an immense deal of experience as to the advantage of
supplementing spectroscopic rain-band observations with
a polariscope equally portable.

HP HE idea of propelling a boat through water by the

fifty years ago to utilise the force of the electromagnet to
drive small electromagnetic engines; and from the small
beginnings of Dal Negro, Henry, Ritchie, and Page, grew
up a group of electric motors which only awaited a cheap
production of electric currents to become valuable labour-
saving appliances. Nor was it a very long stride to fore-
see that if a sufficiently powerful battery could be
accommodated on board a boat, it might be possible to
propel a vessel with electromagnetic engines drawing their
supply of currents from the batteries. This suggestion
one of the earliest, indeed, of the many applications of
the electromagnetwas made by Prof. Jacobi of St
Petersburg, who, in 1838, constructed an electric boal
Fig. 1, which we here reproduce from Hessler*s "Let;-

electro-magnetic motor or engine, which Jacobi devisee
for the driving of his boat. Two series of electro-magnet
of horse-shoe form were fixed upon substantial woodet
frames, and between them, centred upon a shaft which
was connected to the paddle-wheels, rotated a third
frame, carrying a set of straight electro-magnets. Jr

machine was worked at first by a Daniell's battery of
320 couples, containing plates of zinc and copper, 36
square inches each, and excited by a charge of sulphuric
acid and sulphate of copper. The speed attained with
this battery did not reach so much as i\ miles per hour.
But in the following year, 1839, the improvement was
made of substituting 64 Grove's cells, in each of which
the platinum plates were 36 square inches in area. The
boat, which was about 28 feet long, "]\ broad, and not
quite 3 feet in depth, was propelled, with a convoy of
fourteen persons, along the River Neva, at a speed of
l\ (English) miles per hour.
A second attempt at electric navigation was made on a
much smaller scale about two years ago by M. G. Trouve",

Paris, who constructed an electric skiff, in which he

run down the river and a trial of the powers of the boat,
to go forward, slacken, or go astern at will, her head was
turned Citywards, and we spedI cannot say steamed
silently along the southern shore, running about eight
knots an hour against the tide. At 4.37 London Bridge
was reached, where the head of the launch was put about,
while a long line of onlookers from the parapets surveyed
the strange craft that without steam or visible power
without even a visible steersmanmade its way against
wind and tide. Slipping down the ebb the wharf at
Millwall was gained at 5.1, thus in 24 minutes terminating
the trial trip of the Electricity. For the benefit of electri-
cians I may add that the total electromotive force of the
accumulators was 96 volts, and that during the whole of
the long run the current through each machine was
steadily maintained at 24 amperes. Calculations show
that this corresponds to an expenditure of electric energy
at the rate of 3 I'l 1 horse-power.

NATURE
According to the Report of the Government Central
Museum at Madras for the year 1881-82, by Surgeon-Major
Bidie, the number of visitors was 211,246, and therefore 37,348
in excess of the attendance in the previous year, and 23,051
above the average of the preceding five years. Of the visitors,
4CV17 per cent, were women and girls,and 59/82 men and boys;
the corresponding rates in 1880-81 having been 39/36 and 60*63.
There was thus a slight increase in the number of female visitors
on the days on which the Museum was open to all classes. As
in former years, the building was cleared of males, and reserved
exclusively for native ladies on the afternoon of the first Saturday
of each month, but on these occasions the average daily attend-
ance was but 37 against 114 in the previous year. It is difficult
to explain this decline, in the face of the anxiety expressed by
native gentlemen for extended means of intellectual culture and
amusement for the ladies of their families. In some cases it was
evidently considered undignified to visit the Museum when other
ladies were also allowed to attend, as I had various importunate
requests to have the building specially opened for a single family on

The mucous membrane of the larynx is known to be extremely
sensitive, so that, when touched, violent reflex movements are
produced, the glottis contracting spasmodically, and the whole
larynx rising forcibly. M. Brown Sequard has lately made the
interesting observation {Comptes JUcndus) that complete local
anaesthesia may be obtained in the larynx by directing on the
upper part of that organ (through an incision at the back of the

animal's mouth), a rapid current of carbonic acid, for fifteen
seconds to two or three minutes. It becomes possible to intro-
duce a tube and even a finger (in the case of a large dog) into
the cavity of the larynx, and to turn it about without producing
reaction. Chloroform vapour gives the same effect, but the
other gas is preferred. There is some irritation at the outset.
The local anaesthesia, which is accompanied by incomplete
general anaesthesia, lasts several minutes (two to eight) after
stopping the current. The experiment was repeated several
times, at intervals, on the same animal, and no evil results were
apparent. M. Brown Sequard proposes to experiment on the
human subject by introducing carbonic acid into the larynx by
the mouth or nostrils.
It has been recently observed by Prof. Feichtinger of Munich
(Polyt. Jour.) that of a number of different kinds of writing
and printing paper examined, all those kinds that had been
sized with resin had a more or less acid reaction, while this
property was never met with in paper with animal sizing. (Paper
can be easily tested in this respect by placing moistened blue
litmus paper between folds of it.) The acid reaction was found
to be due to free sulphuric acid, and it is thought probable that

inclining to olive. The trichomes, immersed in a homogenous
colourless jelly, spread themselves around a central space; they
increase towards the periphery, and become lost in the interior.
These trichomes give origin to branches, either scattered or uni-
lateral, which elevate themselves to the one height and to hetero-
cysts either sessile on the side of the articulations, or borne on
a pedicel of one to three cells ; intercalary heterocysts were not
observed. The heterocysts were oblong in form, easily to be
distinguished from the ordinary articulations by their size, and
above all, by the nature of their contents, which is more homo-
gen* ous; when old, they assume a yellowish tint; the chloro-
iodide of zinc solution colours them purple. When an articulation
forms a heterocysl or a branch, it first forms a lateral
enlargement, which is very early isolated. This new cell
may at once change into a heterocyst, and then it will be
directly applied to the side of the articulation, as are the
heterocysts of Capsosira and those on the large branches of
Stigonema, or it may be divided once or twice before the forma-
tion of the heterocyst, which will be then pedicellated, or it may
even form the cell from which a branch may arise. The

branches, like the heterocysts, are not uniformly airanged along
the length of the filament. At certain intervals they become
closer and they become level at the same height. Some remain
simple, others ramify, none terminate in a hair. No distinct
trace of a sheath was observed around any of the younger por-
tions of the trichomes, but at the base the articulations are some-
times surrounded with a somewhat thick envelope. None cf

PELAGIC LIFE1
A S used technically by naturalists, the term "Pelagic" applied
to living things denotes those animals and plants which
inhabit the surface waters of the seas and oceans. Just as the
land surfaces, the sea shores, and the deep ocean beds are each
tenanted by assemblages of organisms specially adapted to the
conditions of existence there occurring, so the surface waters of
the oceans are inhabited by a characteristic fauna and fljra.
The special modifications in structure which the members com-
xjsins; this fauna and flora exhibit as adapting them to their
jeculiar envir mment are of a most interesting and remarkable
:haracter: and it is concerning the nature of the Pelagic fauna
ind fl jra, the mutual relations between the two, the strange
forms which Pelagic animals assume, their curious habits of life,
their zoological and geological importance, that the present lecture on Pelagic Life will consist. I have spoken of pelagic life
as belonging to the surface waters of the oceans because it is in
the superficial strata in which it appears to be most fully developed; but, as we shall see in the sequel, it is impossible as yet
to limit definitely the range of pelagic forms in depth, and we
shall even have to refer to some connections of the fauna of the
deep ocean bottom with that of the surface.
Pelagic life then includes the inhabitants of the whole ocean
waters, excluding th >se belonging to the bottom and shores;
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
that is to say, the inhabitants of an area equal to nearly three-
quarters of the surface of the globe. And it may tend to enhance
our appreciation at the outset of the importance of the pelagic
fauna if we reflect that in point of numbers pelagic animals
probably far exceed all others existing. The extraordinary
abundance of life, as seen at the surface of the ocean under certain
circumstances, when the water is often discoloured for miles and
its surface strata absolutely filled with small animals, has often
been described by voyagers, but can never be fully realised till
it is actually witnessed.
The existence of pelagic animals at all is directly dependent on
that of pelagic plants. No animal life can exist without vegetable
food as a basis, and the first living substance which came into
existence must have been cap ible of constructing protein for itself
from inorganic sources, and been physiologically a plant. Now,
in many regions the sea-surface teems with vegetabl life. In the
Polar waters diatoms swarm, s mietimes occurring so abundantly
that they render the water thick like soup, and being washed up
on the ice in the Antarctic regions, colour it brown, as Sir
Joseph Hooker showed. When a fine net is towed overboard
amongst them, they fill it with a jelly-like mass that, when

numbers near land. There are further numerous animals which
are pelagic only in their larval condition, and which, swarming
at the surface with the strictly pelagic forms during their early
stages, sink to the bottom when mature to lead an entirely
different existence. With other pelagic forms, the converse is
the case: the pelagic snakes, turtles, and birds come on shore
to rear their young, spending most of their adult life on the ocean,
and certain whales approach the shore at the breeding season.
These two last groups may be termed hemipelagic.
It is impossible to draw a sharp line between any of these
groups; they run into one another indefinitely. Thus, unlike
the abundant flying-fishes (Exoccetus), the flying gurnets (Dac-
tylopterus), are never found very far from land, but lead a partly
pelagic existence, taking frequent flights from the surface, and
partly inhabit the bottom in shallow water, being taken some-
times at the bottom with a hook and line. Amongst the Hydro-
medusse and Scyphomedusi, all gradations of pelagic habit
occur. Many of both are attached at the sea bottom at certain
stages in their life history, or rest on it habitually, some possibly
in very deep water; others, closely allied, exhibit no fixed con-
dition, and are entirely pelagic.

The Sargasso Sea has a peculiar fauna of its own, which
cannot be considered as strictly pelagic, composed of animals
specially adapted to cling to the gulf-weed and inhabit it, and
differing in general aspect from other pelagic forms. Very
much has been written on this fauna, which is so special that it
may well be left out of consideration here.
Most characteristic of pelagic animals is the almost universal
crystalline transparency of their bodies. So perfect is this
transparency that very many of them are rendered almost entirely
invisible when floating in the water, whilst some, even when
caught and held up to the light in a glass globe, are scarcely to
be seen. The skin, nerves, muscles, and other organs, are abso-
lutely hyaline and transparent in these forms, but natural selection
seems to have been unable to render colourless the liver and
digestive tract in many instances. So these parts remain opaque,
of a yellow or brown colour, and exactly resemble, when seen
in the water, small pieces of floating sea-weed. A familiar
example is Salpa, Pelagonemertes is another.
Certain few pelagic animals are coloured bright blue for pro-
tection, so as exactly to resemble the colours of the waves. Such
are Minyas cceruleus, Velella, Porpita, Physalia, Glaucus, Ianthina,
all of which are forms which float at the very surface, with part
of their bodies more or less out of the water. The blue colora-
tion seems to be connected with this latter circumstance, as pro-
tecting the animals probably from predatory pelagic birds, to
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
which they would be invisible at any distance. Velella does not,
however, thereby escape its enemies altogether, for a young turtle
which we caught at sea during the Challenger expedition, had
its stomach full of Velellas, and we often found them in the
stomachs of albatrosses. Ianthina, the well-known bright blue
gastropod, constructs a float built in compartments, which is
attached to its foot. If this float be detached, the animal sinks
and dies. It is said to be devoid of eyes. Glaucus is a nudi-
branch mollusc, which has the sides of its body modified into
curious fin-like fringed lappets. It floats habitually with its
ventral surface upwards, its foot being applied to the surface of
the water, just as is that of the common pond snail, Paludina,
when the animal is creeping at the surface of the water. In
consequence of the position thus assumed by Glaucus, its
ventral surface is coloured deep blue, whilst its dorsal or
under surface is of a glistening lustrous white. One is so
accustomed to animals floating with their back upwards, and
being coloured accordingly dark on the back and light under-
neath, that the appearance of the animal is most deceptive, and,
indeed, entirely misled Dr. Bennett, who, in his account of the
habits of the animal, speaks of the blue aspect of its body as its

liuute Crustacea of which it is composed, slowly rise and sink just
k e t he pelagic inhabitants of the sea. They never sink to a greater
depth than twenty-five fathoms, but from this depth they rise
adually to the surface in the evening, following the limit of
darkness, as the sun sets, and they descend in the same manner
in the morning as the sun rises. Prof. Forel has observed the same
facts in the Lake of Geneva. Now a depth of about twenty-five
fathoms has been shown by Prof. Forel to be the limit at which
sensitised paper ceases to be acted upon by direct sunlight in
the waters of the Lake of Geneva. Below this depth no sun-
^ht penetrates. Prof. Weissmann, after trying all other
apparent explanations, concludes that the reason why the pelagic
Crustacea oscillate perpetually in this curious manner in depth is
in order to economise the light and be able to feed during the
twenty-four hours over their whole possible range of feeding-
ground. Were they to remain at the surface during the daylight
h ey could not see at all to feed in the depths in the weak light
at night. This most ingenious explanation will no doubt apply
qually well to all the marine pelagic animals with well-deve-
iped eyes, and which feed on the nearly stationary vegetable
matter and dibris held in suspension by the surface strata of the

aters. Whilst the numerous blind forms which execute similar
diurnal oscillations, such as the Ctenophora,1 Echinoderm
irva.,2 Pteropods, and others, must follow the Crustacea and
other small fry to feed upon them. Indeed the whole pelagic
mna is so closely inter-dependent, that it must needs move
together. It is very probable that some forms come to the
surface only at night, because thereby, like so many other
nocturnal animals, they escape many possible enemies by always
keeping in the dark.
Dr. Chun has observed that the Ctenophora of the Gulf
of Naples, after being abundant in spring, become extremely scarce and almost disappear during the three summer
1 mths, and re-appear suddenly again in great numbers in the
autumn. He believes, from having caught them in the summer
t considerable depths, that these Ctenophora descend annually
at the end of spring in order to feed on the minute Crustacea
which then remain in deep water (very possibly because the
more powerful light allows them then to feed at the lower level),
and that, having become fully fed up, and the young having in
the depths passed through their metamorphoses and reached the
dulti condition, they rise together to the surface, and appear
in a swarm as if by magic. One of the Ctenophora with this
labit Uthebeautifulveuusgirdle(C«/KjzwKr('.(). Scypho Medusa?
Cassiobeia Borbonica) and other pelagic animals, appear to per-
form the same periodical migration in depth. Doubtless similar
annual migrations in depth occur amongst pelagic animals in
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
various parts of the world, and this may account for the extra-
>rdinary scarcity of some few.
It appears probable, therefore, that pelagic animals per-
:orm oscillations in depth from three different causes. They
perform, firstly, diurnal oscillations in accordance with the
changes in light and darkness; these, secondly, are liable to
constant interruptions from the occurrence of boisterous weather;
and thirdly, they may alter their depth periodically, according
to the season of the year.
The great inland fresh-water lakes have each a regular
coast or littoral fauna, a deep-sea fauna, and a pelagic
fauna, just like the oceans. The pelagic animals of the
lakes resemble those of the sea in many interesting particu-
I irs. They are, like them, hyaline and transparent, of most
curious forms, modified for a constantly swimming existence, and
sometimes possess immensely developed eyes. 1 shall throw on
the screen figures of two crustaceans from the pelagic fauna of
the Lake of Geneva, from Prof. Weissmann's figures. Both are
Cladocera or water-fleas, of the one-eyed family, Folyphemidte.

reason why they bear the peculiar organs they do, but the food
must be so infinitely more scanty over this intermediate zone than
in the upper stratum that life cannot be abundant in it anywhere,
and no arrangement such as probably exists at the deep sea
bottom whereby unphosphorescent animals profit by the phos-
phorescence of others can occur. At the ocean bottom the
organic debris falling from above becomes again concentrated
and compressed into infinitely less space than in the surface
zone, and life in abundance becomes possible again. The exist-
ence of a deep sea fauna at any great distance from coasts
depends upon that of a Pelagic fauna overhead.
With a net capable of acting like that of Captain Sigsbee a
vast amount of most interesting investigation lies open. We
know as yet next to nothing certain as to the curious oscillations
in depth and migrations of the Pelagic fauna. The matter
would be a very pleasing subject for research for any yachtsman
so disposed, who would care to investigate the movements of
the surface fauna of our coasts, and I would urge any here pre-
sent to take it up.
With regard to the connection between Pelagic and Deep-Sea
Life, a most important question is the still unsettled one as to

the true origin of the Globigerina mud by which so vast an area
of the ocean bottom is covered. As is well known, Globigerina;
and other Foraminifera with calcareous shells ojcur in abundance
at the surface of the ocean. They were originally discovered
there by Johannes Miiller, who was the first to observe in the
Mediterranean off the French coast the Pelagic Globigerina and
Orbulina which are provided with long fine calcareous spines all
over their shells, on which to extend their gelatinous tissue and
thus by increasing their volume enable themselves to float. Other
surface forms are devoid of spines. The well known Globigerina
mud is made up mainly of such shells, and the question is whether
the main part of this important deposit is derived from the
surface, or whether on the ontrary the shells composing it
belong to animals living on the deep-sea bottom. Mr. John
Murray who spent the whole of the Challenger voyage and most
of the time which has elapsed since in investigating the surface
fauna, and comparing with it the deep-sea deposits writes to me,
that he is convinced that in a pure Globigerina mud not 3 per
cent, of the carbonate of lime it contains is derived Irom
organisms living on the bottom. On the other hand, Mr. H. B.
Brady, the great authority on Foraminifera still seems from the
tenour of his short report on the Foraminifera of the Knight
Errant Expedition, to hold an opposite opinion,1 although he
evidently wavers somewhat.2 The sarc ode contained in the un-
doubtedly living surface globigerina; is tough and readily pre-

served in alcohol. It remains firm after the shell has been
removed by acids, and may be readily stained with carmine.
There is no reason why the sarcode of deep-sea specimens should
not be demonstrated with equal ease, yet it is only very rarely
that any is found in them, and even then it appears not to be
definite and fresh like that so readily procured from surface
specimens, and constantly to be seen in other Foraminifera which
certainly live at the bottom. I have never discovered any satis-
factory trace of it myself, though I have often sought for it in
fresh specimens of globigerina mud. The question whether any
form of Globigerina does or does not live on the deep sea
bottom is one which still urgently requires a definite answer.
The subject of the origin of the Globigerina mud is ably dis-
cussed by Butschli,3 in his account of the Protozoa now in course
of issue. One of the principal difficulties in the matter is that
much thicker Globigerina shells are found on the bottom, than
are met with at the surface. He suggests that the additional
thickness may be added to the shell as the animal beconing
heavy gradually sinks into deep water out of reach.
An important geological question is connected with the deposition
of the Globigerina mud. Prof. Haughton, Dr. Croll and more lately

very far, but as Prof. Liitken' has shown the degree of deve-
lopment of the pectoral 6ns bears no constant relation to the
s Lze attained by the young fish, a great increase in size may occur
without a corresponding progress in metamorphosis. In con-
¦ equence of this the young of the common flying Gurnet
Dattylofitcrus volitans, were not for long recognised as such but
were considered distinct and named Cephalacanthus. A
parallel instance to that of Leptocephalus is possibly that of the
curious flattened larva of the Rock Lobster (Palinurus)
Phyllosoma, which is also found in the open ocean attaining
sometimes gigantic proportions. Possibly also other pelagic
larvae become thus hypertrophied in the larval condition. We
may compare with these phenomena the somewhat parallel
modifications which occur naturally or may be produced arti-
fically amongst larval Amphibians.
Many of the Pelagic animals carry with them parasites
similar to those affecting their littoral allies and which thus
are, as it were, imported into the Pelagic fauna, Vut there are a
few definitely pelagic parasites parasitic upon pelagic hosts.
The young of the Pelagic annelid Alciopa are parasitic within
the txxlies of Ctenophora, there is the small rarasitic Hydro-

medusa Mnestra, which adheres to Phyllirhoe, and lastly there
are the young Cunina meduce which cling in dense clusters
within the stomach of the Geryonid Medusa Carmarina, and
were at fir-t imagined to be the young of the Carmarina itself.
A remarkable feature about Pelagic animals is that very many
of them occur in large swarms, some in immense hosts. Further
Velellas, Porpites, and Ianthii es are always met with in schools,
and even Leptocephali, and very many other forms are usually
caught in the tow-net, several at a time.
In their almost univeral geographical distribution except as
regards the colder seas, Pelagic animals resemble the deep-sea
fauna ; as examples it may be mentioned that according to Prof.
Lutken, the tunny of the Mediterranean is identical with that of
Japan, and the albacore of the Atlantic with that of the Pacific.
Pelagic genera seem to be of almost ubiquitous distribution,
though the Atlantic and Pacific species frequently differ.
Some few Pelagic forms seem to be remarkably scarce. As
an instance may be cited Pelagonemertes, the curious Pelagic
Nemertine with a ramified intestine. This form was obtained
in great abundance by Lesson at the surface in 1830, between
the Moluccas and New Guinea. By the Challtngir it was found
twice, only a single specimen being got on each occasion. The
first was caught to the south of Australia, and the second on
the coast of Japan. The animal seems never to have been met
with by any one excepting on these three occasions. On each

occasion when caught by the Challenger it was found in a trawl
which had been down to a great depth. It is therefore very
possible that it very rarely rises to the surface.
Similarly many Pelagic Cephalopods though known to exist
in multitudes are of the greatest rarity, being only known from
fragments. Bu-hels of their horny beaks are found in the
stomachs of whales, which subsist on them, and several genera
are known to Frof. Steenstrupp only from these quantities of
beaks. He has never sten a trace of any other part of them.
Notwithstanding the wide distribution of Pelagic forms, Mr.
Murray finds that he is able to form tolerably correct conclusions
as to the latitude of any sample of deep-sea bottom which con-
tains organic remains submitted to him, from the nature of the
Pelagic debris of which it is compesed. He can also form some
idea of the depth from which a deposit has been brought up by
observing the extent to which the substance of the calcareous
shells has undergone solution. Pteropod shells owing to their
extreme thinness appear to be dissolved first, and disappear say
at 1200 fathoms, then the finest globigerina shells at 2200,
then the larger globigerina shells and so on.

is now on the screen Minyas ctrrnlea, is remarable as being one
of the small band of Pelagic animals which is coloured deep
blue. There are also Pelagic insects of the genus Halobates of
the Bug family, and closely allied to the common water bugs
which skip on the surfaces of our ponds. Halobates is found
clinging to the surface of the waves at all distances from land in
the open oceans, and outrides the heaviest storms.
There are many Pelagic fishes; I have already shown you
the dolphin (Coryphsna). Here is a figure of one of the
Ribbon Fishes, the scarce Regalecus. This fish has usually
been supposed to be a pelagic fish, but Dr. Gunther is per-
suaded that it is a true deep-sea fish, though it has not yet
been caught in any deep-sea net, only picked up dead en the
surface. There are many similar fishes about which some
difference of opinion as yet exists as to their habits. The
young of the Ribbon Fishes are found alive at the sea surface,
and the group may therefore perhaps yield another instance of
the connection of Pelagic with deep-sea forms. The Pelagic

snakes are interesting as, to some extent, modern representatives
of the Eocene sea serpents (Titanophis), for though they come on
shore to produce their young, their existence is mostly spent at
the sea surface often far from land, and they are specially
modified both in the structure of their lungs, and the ribbon-
like flattening of their tails for pelagic existence.
There is one lizard, the well known Amblyrhynchus of the
Galapagos Islands, described by Mr. Darwin in his Journal,
which though it cannot in any way be termed pelagic swims out
to sea, and as the only recent one which does so is worth mention
as a sort of representative of the gigantic pelagic lizards of
Mesozoic periods such as Mososaurus.
With so many groups of the animal kingdom contributing to
the Pelagic fauna, it is remarkable that some large groups should
be entirely unrepresented within it. There are no adult Pelagic
sponges, no Alcyonarians, no Sipunculids, no Brachiopods, no
Lamellibranchs, and lastly no Echinoderms. Considering the
curious adaptations to Pelagic life which have been undergone
by such forms as sea anemonies, nemertines, compound ascidians
and gasteropods, it is most easy to conceive how Lamellibranchs
for example taking after the habit of flying as it were butterfly
fashion through the water like Lima hyans, might have become
Pelagic, and how Echini taking after Minyas, or Comatulae
swimming w ith their arms or Holothurians in various ways might
have assumed a Pelagic dress, but no Lamellibranch, and no

Echinoderm seems ever in the long record of the past to have
been Pelagic since the time of their earliest Pelagic ancestors,
unless possibly Saccoma of the lithographic state was Pelagic.
With regard to the history of the Pelagic fauna in the past.
There can be no doubt, as Prof. Weissmann so well puts it,
that "the birth place of all animal and plant tyfe lay in the sea."
(t is probable that a considerable part of earliest life which
existed must have been Pelagic, and that the ancient Pelagic
fauna was to a large extent the parent cf all other life. The
developmental history of all marine animals points clearly in this
direction, closely similar transparent Pelagic larval forms being
common to groups of widely different adult littoral forms. The
resemblance between the larvae of these adult forms can hardly
be conceived to have been arrived at by natural selection after
the adult forms had already diverged from one another. It is
only to be explained on the hypothesis of an original Pelagic
ancestral condition. One of tire Monera, Protomyxa aurantiaca,
is even now a Pelagic form, having been found by Prof. Haeckel
adhering to a floating spirula shell.

apparatus, plugs for preventing convection-current ia a bore or
well are referred to. Prof. Lebour's umbrella-like plug, in its
final form, appears to be very convenient, as it requires only one
wire. It remains collapsed so long as the wire is taut, but opens
out and plugs the hole when it becomes slack.
B. Methods ok Observation.These have chiefly been of
two kinds: 1. Observations in holes bored to the depth of a
few feet in newly-opened rock, either in the workings of a mine
or a tunnel, or in a shaft during the sinking. The rock should
not have been exposed for more than a week when the hale is
bored, and a day may be allowed to elapse for the heat generated
by boring to escape before the thermometer is inserted. Very
c oinplete plugging is necessary to exclude the influence of the
external air. It is desirable to use about two feet of plugging,
of which the outer part should be made air-tight with plastic
clay or greased rag. After the lapse of a few days, the thermo-
meter is to be drawn out by means of a string attached to the
handle of its copper case, and the reading taken. The slow-
action thermometer above described is employed for this pur-
pose, and there is time to read it with sufficient deliberation
before any appreciable change occurs in its indication. It is

recommended that the thermometer be then reinserted and
plu2gecl *s before, and a second reading taken after the lapse of
a week. The majority of our successful observations have been
made by this method.
2. Observations in deep bores of small diameter. The first
report contained a successful application of this method to
a bore about 350 feet deep, near Glasgow, which gave very
regular results in a series of observations at every sixtieth
foot of depth; but in the majority of instances in which it has
since been applied, there have been marked irregularities, due
apparently to the influx of water from springs at particular
points. One of the most valuable of our results was obtained
hy the application of the method to a bore 863 feet deep, exe-
cuted at the bottom of a coal mine 1066 feet deep, giving a total
depth of 1929 feet. The bore in this case was dry at the time of
its execution, though full of water at the time of the observation.
It was in South Hetton Colliery, Durham. The instrument
generally employed in the observations of this class was a
maximum thermometer of either the Phillips or the Inverted
Negretti construction.
The larger the diameter of the bore, the more uncertain does
this mode of observation become. Thi South Hetton bore had
a diameter of 2J inches. The Kentish Town well, 1000 feet
deep, in which Mr. Symons' observations were made, had a dia-
meter of 8 inches, and the well 660 metres deep at La Chapelle,
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
in the north of Paris, had a diameter of 44 feet (V., VI., VII.).
The temperatures in this last were proved to be largely affected
by convection, the water at the top being too warm, and that at
the bottom not warm enough. The observations of Herr Dunker,
in the bore at Sperenberg, near Berlin, with a depth of 3390
feet and a diameter of 12 inches, proved a similar disturbance,
amounting at the top and bottom, to several degrees. As re-
gards the bottom, the proof consisted in showing that when a
thermometer at the bottom was protected by a tight plug from
the influence of the water above, its indications were higher by
3° R. (= d\" F.) than when this precaution was not employed.
C. Questions affecting the Correctness of the
Observations made might theoretically include questions as
to the correct working of the instruments employed, and as to
the personal reliability of observers; but the latter topic has not
come into discussion, and the former has not arisen since our
present patterns of instrument came into use. The questions for
discussion are thus ^confined to those which relate to possible
differences between the temperature of the point at which the
thermometer was placed and the normal temperature at the same
depth in its vicinity.

diate vicinity showed a tenperature 9°'o R. at the bottom. This is direct evidence that the water near the top of the great
bore hid been warmed 2° R., or 4$' F. by convection.
Suggestion; for observations in filled-up bores will be found
in the eleventh report, but they have not yet taken a practical
shape.
D. Questions affecting Deductions from Observa-
tions I. In many instances the observations of temperature
have been confined to considerable depths, and in order to
deduce the mean rate of increase from the surface downwards it
has been necessary to assume the mean temperature of the
surface. To do this correctly is all the more difficult, because
there seems to be a sensible difference between the mean tempe-
rature of the surface and that of the air a few feet above it.
In the third report tome iuformation on this point is given,
based on observations of thermometers 22 inches deep at some
of the stations of the Scottish Meteorological Society, and of
thermometers 3 (French) feet deep at Greenwich and at Edin-
burgh. These observations point to an excess of surface-temperature above air-temperature, ranging from half a degree to
nearly two degrees, and having an average value of about one
degree.

Mines at Schemnitz, in sending his observations made in the
mines at that place, remarks on this point:
"Observations in various localities show that in sandy soils
the excess in question amounts, on the average, to abou' half a
degree Centigrade. In this locality the surface is a compact
rock, which is highly heated by the sun in summer, and is protected
from radiation by a covering of snow in winter; and the conforma-
tion of the hills in the neighbourhood is such as to give protection
against the prevailing winds. Hence the excess is probably greater
here than in most places, and may fairly be assumed to be
double the above average."
Some excellent observations of underground temperature at
small depths were made at the Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park,
London, for the six years 1871-76, along with observations of
air-temperature, and have been reduced by Mr. Symons. They
are at depths of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 inches beneath a surface of
grass, and their joint mean derived from readings at 9 a.m. and
9 p.m. for the six years is 49'9, the mean for the 48 inch ther-
mometer being 5005. The mean air-temperature derived in
the same way from the readings of the dry-bulb thermometer is
496. Hence it appears that the excess of soil above air is in
this ca e about o°-4.
Quetclct's observations for three years at Brussels (p. 48 of
his "Memoire") make the earth, at depths less than 1I foot,
colder than the air, and at greater depths warmer than the air.
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
Caldecott's observations for three years at Trevandrum, in
India, make the ground at the depth of 3 feet warmer than the
air by $°-j F.
Dr. Stapff, in his elaborate publications on the temperature of
the St. Gothard Tunnel, arrives at the conclusion that the mean
temperature of the soil on the surface of the mountain above the
tunnel is some decrees higher than that of the air, the excess
increasing with the height of the surface and ranging from 2° or
3° C. near the ends of the tunnel, to 5° or 6° in the neighbour-
hood of the central ridge.
2. Connected with this is the questionWhether the mean
annual temperature of the soil increase; downwards from the
surface itself, or whether, as is sometimes asserted, the increase
only begins where annual range ceases to be sensiblesay at a
depth of 50 or 60 feet.
The general answer is obvious from the nature of conduction.
Starting with the fact that temperature increases downwards
at depths where the annual range is insensible, it follows
that heat is travelling upwards, because heat will always pass
from a hotter to a colder stratum. This heat must make its way
to the surface and escape there. But it could not make its way

the conductivity, using the word "conductivity" (as above
plained) in such a sense as to include convection. The rate of
crease downwards must, therefore, be the same at all depths
which this conductivity is the same.
This reasoning applies to superposed strata at the same place,
id assumes them to be sufficiently regular in their arrangement
ensure that the flow of heat shall be in parallel lines, not in
nverging or diverging lines.
5- If we have reason to believe that the flow of heat upwards
nearly the same at all places, then the abo :e reasoning can
so be applied approximately to the comparison of one place
ith anotherthat is to say, the rates of increase downward*, in
\ o masses of rock at two different place*, must be approxi-
lately in the inverse ratio of their conductivities. In the cooling
i a heated sphere of heterogeneous compo-ition, the rates of
low would at first be very unequal through different parts of
he surface, being most rapid through those portions of the
ubstance which conducted best; but these portions would thus
>e more rapidly drained of their heat than the other portions,
tnd thus their rates of flow would fall off more rapidly than the
rates of flow in the other portions. If the only differences in

the material were differences of conductivity, we might on this
account expect the outflow to be after a long time nearly the
same at all parts of the surface. But when we come to consider
differences of "thermal capacity per unit volume," it is clear
that with equal values of "diffusivity," that is of "conductivity
divided by thermal capacity of unit volume" in two places, say
in two adjacent sectors of the globe, there would be the ;ame
distribution of temperatures in both, but not the same flow of
heat, this latter being greatest in the sector in which the capacity
and conductivity were greatest.
Where we find, as in Mr. Deacon's observations at Bootle,
near Liverpool, and to a less marked degree in the observations
of Sir William Fairbairn and Mr. Gaiside, near Manchester, an
exceptionally slow rate of increase, without exceptionally good
conductivity, it is open to us to fall back on the explanation of
exceptionally small thermal capacity per unit volume in the
underlying region of the earth, perhaps at depths of from a few
miles to a few hundred miles.
6. A question which was brought into consideration by Prof.
Hull, in connection with the great difference between the rate of
increase at Dukinfield and that at Rosebridge, is the effect of the
dip of the strata npon the vertical conduction of heat. Lami-
nated rocks conduct heat much better along the planes of lami-
nation than at right angles to them. If it denote the conducti-
vity along, and £a the conductivity normal to the planes of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
lamination, and if these planes are inclined at an angle B to the
horizon, the number of feet per degree of increase downwards
correrponding to a given rate of outflow through the surface,
will be the same as if the flow were vertical with a vertical
conductivity:
£j sin* 9 + kt cos0 8.
Prof. Herschel finds about 1*3 as the ratio of the two principal
conductivities in Loch Rannoch flagstone, and 1 875 as the ratio
in Festiniog slate.
The dip of the strata at Dukinfield is statid by Mr. Garside to
be 150, and we have sin2 15° = -07, cos2 15° = '93.
If we assume £, = I "3 kv as in the case of flagstone, we find
for the effective vertical conductivity & (09 + "93) = 1 '02 kv so
that the number of feet per degree would only be increased by
2 per cent.
It is not likely that the two condnciivities in the strata at
Dukinfield are so unequal as even in the case of flagstone, so
that 2 per cent, is a high estimate of the effect of their dip on
the vertical rate of increase so far as pure conduction is con-
cerned. The effect of dip in promoting the percolation of
water is a distinct consideration, but the workings of the Dukin-

must be heated about 240° above its boiling-point before its
density becomes strictly normal. From the experiments of V.
Meyer and others, iodine vapour appears to be normal a very
few degrees above the boiling-point. It appears, therefore,
probable that vapour of chlorine, bromine, or iodine at low tem-
peratures, contains groups of molecules which are dissociated as
the temperature rises, and that the greater the molecular weight
the more easily are these molecular groups dissociated.
Reference was made in a note (Nature, vol. xxvi. p. 306),
to Spring's researches on the expansion of isomorphous com-
pounds; in last number of the Berliner Berichte Pettersson
draws attention to accurate determinations of the specific gravi-
ties of various alums, published by him a few years ago, which
j.roved that the quotients of the specific gravities of the alums
by their respective formula weigh's, are not equal, as assumed
by Spring, but show considerable differences. Spring's work
on the expansion of alums may lead to interesting results, but it
seems evident that he has been too has'y in drawing sweeping
conclusions regarding the molecular structure of solids from
quite insufficient data.

spectroscopic method for determining whether there is, or is not,
any chemical action occurring in a solution containing two or
more coloured salts. The method consists essentially in com-
paring the sums of the absorption spectra of the individual salts
with the absorption spectrum of the solution containing all the
salts.
An abstract of an important paper by Mendelejeff on thermo-
chemistry appeared in the Berichte for July 10 [xx. 1555]. Men-
delejeff asserts that the data hitherto attained by Berthelot,
Thomsen, and others, regarding the "heats of formation"
->i hydrocarbons stand in need of correction, because allowance
has not been made for the physical changes, involving absorp-
tion or evolution of heat, which in every case accompany the
chemical changes considered. Mendelejeff gives a table showing
the "heats of formation" from marsh gas, carbon monoxide,
and carbon dioxide, of a series of hydrocarbons; the chemical
reactions, the thermal equivalents of which are set down in this
table, are reactions which actually occur, unlike the reactions of
formation of Berthelot and others, which as a rule cannot be
realised in actual experiments.
Messrs. Smith and Lowe find that when chlorine is passed
through a porcelain tube heated to 1030*, and then into potas-
sium iodide solution, less iodine is liberated than is the case when
the same quantity of chlorine is allowed to act on the iodide at
ordinary temperature ; they conclude, therefore, that chlorine is

According to Mixter (Amer. Chem. J., iv. 35), urea is
readily obtained by passing ammonia and carbon dioxide through
a red-hot tube: ammonium cyanate is probably produced, and
then transformed into urea.
Selmi (R. Acad, dti Lincci, v. 174) states that he has
found alkaloidal compounds having specific poisonous actions in
the urine of patients suffering from paralysis, tetanus, &c. He
considers death to be determined by the action of these poisons
produced by the progress of the disease.
By electrolysing water by a powerful current, using a positive
electrode of gas-coke purified by the action of chlorine at a very

A HISTORY OF COAL MINING
A History of Coal Mining in Great Britain. By Robert
L. Galloway, Author of "The Steam-Engine and its
Inventors." (London: Macmillan and Co., 1882.)
THIS unpretentious little volume of 273 pages contains
a vastly greater amount of information of a useful
and varied character than might at first sight be expected,
and its author has evidently taken pains to collect the
whole of his data from authentic and original sources.
He has also succeeded to an eminent degree in welding
them together into a concise, clearly written, and in-
tensely interesting narrative. The twenty-three chapters
into which the work is divided partly serve the purpose
of marking more or less distinct epochs in the history of
mining, partly pave the way for introducing accounts of
inventions which have owed their origin to its ever-
growing necessities. Prominent among these are the
railway and the steam-engine, both of which were born
and fostered amongst the coal-mines of Great Britain
more than a hundred years before they began to revo-
lutionise the world.

It would appear from Mr. Galloway's account that coal
first began to be used as a fuel in some localities about
the beginning of the thiiteenth century. Much objection
was raise 1 against its introduction into London on the
plea that its smoke was an intolerable nuisance. This
opposition was continued for nearly two hundred years in
some quarters, but was at last obliged to give way before
the growing scarcity of timber. Towards the beginning
of the fourteenth century many shallow collieries were
opened out in the neighbourhood of Newcastle-on-Tvne,
but little is known about the progress of our subject
during the course of the fifteenth century. There is
enough to show, however, that the demand for coal went
on increasing. In a petition presented to the Council by
the Company of Brewers in 1578 we find that corporation
offering to use wood only in the neighbourhood of West-
minster Palace, as they understand that the Queen findeth
"herscalfe greatley greved and anoyed with the taste and
smoke of the sea cooles." Another author writing in 1631
says that "within thirty years last the nice dames of
London would not come into any house or room when
sea coals were burned, nor willingly eat of the meat that
was either ?od or roasted with sea coal fire."
Soon after the commencement of the seventeenth cen-
tury the use of coal for domestic purposes as well as for

washing, brewing, dyeing, &c.,was general and complete.
The mines were still shallow, and they were drained by
means of horizontal tunnels called adits, water-gates, &c
Already attempts had been made to sink some of them
under the water-level and to raise the water by machinery.
In the year 1486-7 the monks of Finchdale Priory ex-
pended a sum of money at one of their collieries on the
Wear "on the new ordinance of the pump" and on the
purchase of horses to work it. Underground fires and
noxious gases began also to appear about this time. The
miners' tools consisted of a pick, a hammer, a wedge, and
a wooden shovel. The coal was raised to the surface in

some cases by means of a windlass, in others, as in the
mines of the east of Scotland, it was carried up stairs on
the backs of women called coal-bearers. In the year

the produce of the northern collieriesone-half to London
the remainder to other destinationsnumbered four

structed a railway at his colliery at Neath in Glamorgan-
shire as early as 1698, but after it had been in use for
eight years it was declared to be a nuisance by the grand
jury at Cardiff, and part of it, which crossed the highway
between Cardiff and Neath, was torn up and the rails cut
in pieces.
Up to the beginning of the eighteenth century the air-
currents which ventilated the mines were induced solely
by natural causes. It was, however, customary to guide
the current into the required channels by means of
stoppings. As soon as the supply of air was found to be
inadequate a new shaft was sunk. Fire-damp was now
met with in considerable quantities in the deeper mines,
and explosions, which destroyed many lives, began to
take place. The first calamity of this kind on the Tyne
occurred in 1705, when thirty lives were lost. In 1732
attempts were made in the North of England to produce
artificial ventilation by the use of fire-lamps or furnaces,
and these appliances were soon afterwards introduced
into the collieries of the Tyne. Many disastrous ex-
plosions occurred during the eighteenth century and early

in the present one, and some remedy was loudly called
for. As early as 1733 flint and steel were being used for
lighting in the Whitehaven mines, but it appears to be
doubtful whether the steel-mill had then been invented.
It is certain, however, that it had come into existence in
1753, when its inventor, Spedding, was referred to under
the name of Prospero, in a poem in which Dr. Dalton
calls it
"That strange spark-emitting wheel Which, formed by Prospero's magic care,
Plays harmless in the sulphurous air,
Without a flame diffuses light, And makes the grisly cavern bright."
The steel-mill was at the best a treacherous friend, and
our author recounts the various incidents which led to its
detection as such, and its abandonment. He also traces
minutely the various steps which led to Sir Humphry
Davy's splendid invention of the safety lamp in the end
of the year 1815, and he gives what appears to be an
impartial analysis of the claims put forward by, and on
behalf of, George Stephenson to be the original inventor
of a similar lamp at the same time.
"The discovery which Sir Humphry Davy had made,
that explosion would not pass through small apertures
and tubes, was only a stepping-stone to still higher
achievements; and before the close of the year 1815 he

We must now, however, draw our review to a close
without having so much as mentioned many another inte-
resting topic which we hoped to have touched uponsuch
as the perseverance of Sir Robert Mansell, Vice-Admiral
of England, in substituting coal for charcoal in glass

found in such treatises, we find Jamin's researches on
laminated magnets, the thermo-electric effect discovered
by Bouty between a metal and its salt, the so-called in-
ternal-current galvanometer of Conrad Cooke, and other
matters. Many of the drawings are new and suggestive)
though some of them (for example, the Ruhmkorff's coil
on p. 189) are not quite on the level of the usual excel-
lence of French scientific illustrations. We have serious
fault to find only with one minor point; M. Gariel gives
in detail the researches of Wheatstone, Fizeau, and
Guillemin on the (supposed) "velocity of electricity,"
without letting his readers know that the apparent velocity
of an electric wave which these observers essayed to de-
termine, is a very different thing from the velocity of
electricity itself, to which no man can assign any definite
value whatever, and which may be infinite or infinitesimal.
We congratulate M. Gariel and wish his work success.

The Recent Magnetic Storm and Aurora
¦ The following particulars of the magnetic storm of October
2, and of the aurora which accompanied it, may be of interest.
At 2ih. 40m. G.M.T. on October 1, a sudden disturbance of
the magnetic declination and horizontal force commenced, and
the motions were rapid, though not exceptionally large, until
about 6h. 50m. on October 2, when a large decrease of declina-
tion and horizontal force took place. From about 6h. 50m. to
yh. 20m. the declination diminished 1°, and the horizontal force
about l-70th part. The motions were active till Ilh., less so
till 14I1. or 15I1., when the disturbance ended. There was much
activity between 9b. and ioh.
Both earth-current traces showed a sudden commencement of
disturbance at 2ih. 40m., just as in the case of the magnetic
registers, the time: of greatest activity, and the time of cessation
of disturbance being also coincident. As is usually the case,
earth-currents were more active along the north and south line,
than along the east and west.
As regards the aurora, a bright arch extended along the north
horizon to an altitude of 20° from 6b. 48m. to 74h., and remark-

able outbursts of streamers were noted from 6ijh. to 74h., and
from 9I1. 8m. to oh. 25m., corresponding closely in point of
time with the more active parts of the magnetic disturbance.
Patches of phosphorescent light were seen in various parts of the
southern sky between 7I1, and 7I1. 36m., and ruddy light (prin-
cipally near Arcturus) was observed between 6jh. and 74b.
In connection with this magnetic disturbance it is to be
remarked that a large spot was on the central meridian of the
sun on September 30, having been first seen near the east limb
on September 25. It increased considerably in size as it passed
across the disc, and its dimensions on September 30 were:
length, 108"; breadth, 65"; area of whole spot (in millionths of
the sun's visible hemisphere), 990; of umbra, 215. There was
a line of smaller spots following it 128" in length, with an area
of 520, and a spot of considerable size near the equator, forming,
on October 1, with the large spot, three spots visible to the
naked eye. The large spot was nearly in the same position on
the sun's surface as the great spot of last April, its heliographic
longitude being 51°, and latitude 22° S., whilst the position of
the great spot on April 10 was long. 65°, lat. 29° S., and at its
next return long. 52°, lat. 290 S. W. H. M. Christie

Newton, Wollaston, and Fraunhofer's Lines
In most of the current treatises on spectrum analysis, on the
spectroscope, and on optics generally (Lloyd's works being
exceptions), injustice is done to Newton's care, and scientific
insight in his optical experiments, when Wollaston's discovery
of the dark lines in the s>!ar spectrum is alluded to, by most
positive statements to the effect that Newton never used the
slit, or that Wollaston was the first who ever made observations
on the pure spectrum.
That the statements are erroneous may be seen by a com-
I<arison of the following extracts from Wollaston's paper in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1802, p. 378, and Newton's
'' Opticks " edition of 1704.
Wollaston concludes from his experiments that " the colours
into which a beam of white light is separable by refraction,

nor reducible by any means (that I can find) to 3, as some persons have conceived, but that by employing a very narrow
pencil of light, four primary divisions of the prismatic spectrum
may be seen with a degree of distinctness, that, I believe, has
not been described nor observed before." He describes the
experiment as follows :
"If a beam of daylight be admitted into a dark room by a
crevice 110th of an inch broad, and received by the eye at a
distance of 10 or 12 feet, through a prism of flint glass fretfrom
veins [italicised by Wollaston], held near the eye, the beam is
seen to be separated into the four following colours only, r»d,
yellowi-h, green, blue, and violet." He then describes four
lines marking these divisions, together with two others for which
he does not offer any explanation.
Compare with this Prop. 4 of Book I. of the "Opticks,"
which is "To separate from one another the heterogeneous
rays of compound light." Newton, after showing at some
length why he uses a lens to "diminish the mixture of the rays,"
describes Experiment 11, p. 47, a.% follows :
"In the sun's light let into my darkened chamber through a
small round hole in my window-shutter, at about ten or twelve
feet from the window, I placed a lens, by which the image of
the hole might be distinctly cast upon a sheet of white paper.
. . . Then immediately after the lens I placed a prism, by
which the trajected light might be refrae'ed either upwards or
sideways." The "oblong image" thus formed he received
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
upon paper placed "at the just distance where the rectilinear
sides of the image became most distinct." By varying the size
of the hole, he made "the mixture of the rays in the image to
be as much or as little as I desired." For this purpose he
caused the breadth of the image to be sometimes sixty or seventy
times less than its length.
"Yet installof the circular hole, 'tis better to substitute an
o'>long hole shaped like a long parallelogram, with its length
parallel to the prism. For if this hole be an inch or two long,
and but a tenth or twentieth part of an inch broad or nar-
rower; the light of the image will be as simple as before, or
simpler, and the image will become much broader, and therefore
more fit to have experiments tried in its light than before."
For the purpose of comparing the simpler light with the more
compound, he used also a hole of the shape of an isosceles
triangle, whose base was "about the tenth part of an inch, and
is height an inch or more" (the width of which, therefore, at
n quarter of an inch from the vertex, would be one-fortieth of
an inch). The refracting edge of the prism was parallel to the
perpendicular of the triangle. The imnges would therefore be

fog in London, the knowledge of this rain-band would not help
him mncta, for he knows by his chart that rain has already
set in.
¦What he does want to know is whether the cyclone will move
northwards, eastwards, or southwards. This no prognostic can
tell him ; the only known clue to a cyclone path is got from a
knowledge of the movements of isobaric lines. In this instance
the rain in London was, I think, correctly forecast, but unfor-
tunately such a simple case rarely occurs in this country.
Thus we see that a knowledge of the amount of moisture in any
current is of only secondary importance to synoptic forecasting,
so that if we may welcome the rainband as an addition to our
old stock of prognostics, there is little ground for hoping that it
will be of further service than them.
All that Prof. Smyth claims for the spectroscope is to act as a
gauge of pure vapour quantity, but it eerns probable that its
employment may be still further extended. There are strong
grounds for believing that an air spectrum may vary not only
with the amount of pure vapour, tut also with the size, aggrega-
tion, and physical condition of the condensed vapour suspended
in it. For instance, take the so-called rain-lines. These may

appear either alone, or with a rain-band of any intensity ; so that
if the band is due to pure vapour only, the lines must depend on
some other condition Again in sunset tints we have a natural
spectroscope whose colours certainly are the product of both the
quantity and quality of the total moisture suspended in the air.
1 have made a large number of observations on the lurid,
coppery, yellow, green, and red skies, which form such a large
portion of all weather lore, but without decisive results; for sun-
^et spectra are too complicated and too fleeting to be unravelled
by a small instrument. They certainly seem to differ, hut their
spectra are not so marked as their appeal ance to the naked eye.
But even supposing that this idea is completely verified, and
that the spectroscope can be used as a new weapon of research
to discover the still unknown nature of clouds, and that we are
ever able to say that \ uch and such an absorption spectrum belongs
to such and such a kind of sky, there aie no grounds for believ-
ing that we can ever regard these spectra otherwise than as a new
set of sky prognostics, or that as such they will be of more use
in forecasting than those already known.
What the use of any prognostics is in forecasting, and how
they are related to synoptic charts, and how i.-obaric lines map
out the shape of rain areas, are other sides of the great problem
of weather forecasting, which cannot be discussed here.
Some may differ from Prof. Smythe as to the forecasting value
of the rain-band, but all will appreciate the singular skill with

making it a quantitative measure of atmospheric vapour.

mate, who had never been taught to speak, could never rise
higher than a brute, because he cannot picture "ju-tice" or
"edibility." But if we recognise the power to abstract the
conception of roundness, justice, edibility, &c, then can be felt
the want of symbols to represent them ; just as a concrete thing,
say, a tree, needs the word "tree" to stand for it. Instead,
therefore, of considering abstract ideas as an "attempt to con-
ceive a reality-in-thought answering to certain of our symbols,"
I would completely reverse the process and make speech itself
as the outcome of our power of making abstractions objects of
thought, i.e. not only can we be conscious of what is white, as
a dog also can, but we, and we alone, can be conscious of
whiteness; and just as the symbol "white" is invented to stand
for the concrete, so " whiteness" is the symbol invented to stand
for the abstract. George Henslow

An Insect Attacking a Worm
Mr. E. Lawrence's letter in this week's Nature reminds
me that, walking, now many years ago, on a very hot and bright

beaten and sun-baked highway. What has brought you forth at
such a time? I asked, and speedily got my answer. For, coming

nearer, I found the larva of some beetle holding on obstinately
by the poor worm's tail. I had not leisure to wait the result;
and indeed, although here memory does not help me, I may
have interfered on behalf of the worm, and so failed to witness
anything corresponding to Mr. Lawrence's interesting experi-
ences.
Even although such encounters as that witnessed by him may
be but rarely visible, I venture to believe that earthworms very
often fall victims to predaceous larva;. Those of the Caribida;
and other predacious beetles are common enough, that of the
well-known ferocious being, the "rove-beetle" (Staphylinus
olens), for example. The singular pointed tail appendage of its
larva, supposed to a-si>t locomotion, may have a more important
use. Turned to an acute angle with the body, it may effectually
help the larva to hold its place in a worm-hole against the efforts of its prey to escape from its jaws. And only when the captured
worm is very powerful may it be able to come to the surface of
the ground, dragging its relentle-s foe alon* with it. Such,
indeed, was the worm I saw, which had thriven well in the rich
meadow-land bordering the Portobello Road, near Edinburgh,
copiously irrigated with town sewage, and famous for its fertility.
It was the largest I remember ever to have seen, to the best of
my belief at the time not less than a foot Ion?, while its assailant

attacks such as he witnessed at Laqueville. I saw, in North
Devonshire, in the last week of July, 1882, an incident precisely
like that which he narrates. The insect I should judge from
his description was identical. What particularly impressed me
was its enormous strength, for the earth-worm, which was a
large specimen of its kind, must have had at least twenty times
the bulk of its adversary, and yet the insect, seizing upin the
middle of the body, dragged it by main force a distance of
three or four inches. It was cunning as well as strong; for
when it found that the corpse, dragged loopwise from the
middle, met with c nsiderable resistance from the stiff wiry
grass, it seized hold of the head, brought it round over the
middle, and endeavoured to drag the worm lengthwise between
the opposing stalks. I watched the attack for some time,
and then removed the insect with my stick to a distance to see
if it would find out the worm again, but in doing so I unfor-
tunately injured it. When I first saw it the worm could still
crawl, though feebly, but at the end of the attack it was quite
motionless. Herbert Rix

upon stilts executed a series of wonderful evolutions.
While they were proceeding, the chief's daughters, well-
grown, black-haired girls of from 12 to 20 years of

buffaloes lie in the mud, and pretty white herons seek
their prey. After several miles of this, we come to the
lovely lagoon of Boralu, the road sometimes skirting its
shores, sometimes making wide detours. The banks are

loneliness and the entire absence of human cultivation.
The impression is not destroyed by the carriage-road

canoe from capsizing. Our speed was almost equal to
that of a powerful steamer. No better illustration could
have been found of the ease with which the narrow Sing-

the question of house sanitation, pointed out that not one
quarter of the dwellings of all classeshigh or low, rich
or poorare free from dangers to health, due to defects
with respect of drainage, water, or ventilation, and he
gave a summary of the rules which should everywhere be
laid down to secure entire disconnection between the in-
crior of houses and the public sewers, basing his remarks
in this connection on the model series of bye-laws issued
by the Local Government Board. Mr. Robinson's esti-
nate of the proportion of unhealthy houses is, we fear,
below the mark, and in towns it is probable that the
houses of the well-to-do exhibit greater sources of danger
than those of the poor, and this by reason of the number
of pipes passing from cisterns, baths, sinks, lavatories,
&c, directly into the drains. By means of these direct
connections sewer air can, notwithstanding water-traps,
easily make its way into dwellings, and the more
numerous they are, the greater the danger. Dealing with

puscles of animal origin had been found in air which had
been vitiated from certain sources, and how by means of
the discovery the.sources of evil were detected and hence
done away with. Dr. Bartlett holds a strong opinion
against the probability of finding specific disease germs in
any form by which our present powers of observation can
recognise them, but he is equally impressed with the
indications afforded by the results of some of his experi-
ments as to the noxious influence of animal organisms,
including, perhaps, the specific matter of the various
contagia and of tubercle, which are often contained in
impure air.
Capt. R. T. Hildyard drew attention to the influence
for good which might be exerted by medical men if, in
the course of their private practice, they had more
regard to the sanitary conditions under which their
patients were living.The Hon. J. A. R. Russell brought

of temperature, yearly, monthly, and diurnal, were less at
certain elevations than in lower sites, and he regarded it
most desirable that every house should be built on arches
or on piers admitting of ventilation above the ground
level, and that in country districts no house should be
considered habitable of which the floor is on a level with
or below the ground.Miss Yates, Hon. Sec. to the
Bread Reform League, pointed out the advantages of
wheat-meal bread over white bread, both as regards its
nutritive properties and otherwise, and urged its general
use as a means of promoting national health, especially
amongst the classes depending on bread as their main

ON THE PERCEPTION OF COLOURS BY THE
ANCIENT MAORIS
IN an interesting paper on this subject by Mr. Colenso,
he gives a great deal of information on this subject,
derived from his individual experience during a very long
period of dwelling among the Maoris, and that before the
country was settled, and by his having travelled very much
among them, frequently in parts where no white man had
ever been, sometimes on the battle-field, both during and
after the fight, ever with them as medical man, often in
the confidence of their best head men. The colours of

black, white, red and brown were the prized and favourite
ones. The purer states, especially of each of these
colours were highly valued, to which may be added green
and yellow. These several colours and their varying hues
comprised nearly all that pertained to their dresses and
personal decorations, to their principal houses and
canoes. In the olden times a chief's house might truly
be called a house "of many colours," which were artisti-
cally and laboriously displayed. Each tint or shade of
colour bore its own peculiar name plainly and naturally,
or figuratively sometimes both. They possessed a fine
general discrimination of the various shades and hues
and tints ; they could give an accurate description of a
rainbow, of all its various colours; they noticed the iri-
descent hues of the feathers of a pigeon's neck, of some
shells, and the delicate evanescent tints on the ventral
surfaces of many fish. From their general hues alone the
Maoris could accurately tell whether far off and to them un-
known districts were covered with a vegetation of fern or
flax (Phormium) or grasses, but far above all their fine
discrimination of delicate hues and shades was correctly

NATURE
But the classical research of Liebig and Wohler on
"oil of bitter almonds" in 1832, recalled investigators
to the true paths of advance. By recognising the exist-
ence in a series of compound molecules of a group of
elementary atomswhich group they called benzoyl
Liebig and Wohler were able to bring together, and so to
explain the properties of compounds derived from this
oil, compounds which to the less imaginative chemist
appeared to belong to altogether different classes of
bodies.
Thus was inaugurated the modern conception of com-
pound radicle, a conception which, being much more
elastic than that of the Berzelian radicle which preceded
it, and being at the same time sufficiently precise, was
destined to lead to that of a replacing value for each
radicle, and so to be merged in the wider hypothesis of
the chemical equivalency of elementary atoms.
But in other and different fields the influence of the
work of Wohler has also been felt. Called to the Pro-
fessorship of Chemistry at Gottingen in 1836, for more
than forty years Wohler pursued his investigations into

the properties of metals and metallic compounds. Do
we not owe to him much of our knowledge of aluminium
and of nickel? Was it not he who taught us how to
separate cobalt from nickel and from manganese? Did
we not learn from him much concerning the properties of
chromium, tungsten, tellurium, arsenic, and titanium?
His researches have thrown light on the chemistry of
palladium and iridium, of beryllium and yttrium, and
largely on the properties of silicon.
In 1833 Wohler published the " Grundriss der Chemie,"
a book which is known wherever chemistry is studied,
and which has been translated into the English, French,
Dutch, Swedish, and Danish languages.
In 1861 the publication of his ''Mineral Analysis"
enriched analytical chemistry with methods of rare
accuracy and general applicability.
Worker's translations into German of the Lehrbuch and
Jahresberichte of Berzelius brought those classical works
within the reach of every chemist.
But what shall be said of the influence of this great
student of nature on others? Many a chemist looks to
Gottingen as to the place where he learned what research
means.
He has lived long and nobly; he has seen chemistry
grow from a feeble plant to a spreading tree, and to that

PALEOLITHIC GRAVELS OF NORTHEAST
LONDON
"POURING the present spring and summer several new
*-* and instructive sections through the beds con-
taining Palaeolithic implements have been laid open at
and near Stoke Newington. For the first time in my
memory sections have been exposed which show the real
age of the beds near the valley of the Hackney Brook,
together with the older deposits on which they rest.
Stoke Newington, Highbury, and Hackney are now so
much built over, and where not built over, the surface of
the ground has been so much disturbed for market
gardening, brick-making, and excavations for sand and
gravel, that one might live near the place for a lifetime
and never see a section of four feet which would show
the true nature of the uppermost deposits.
In Nature, vol. xxv. p. 460, I described the "Palaeo-

upper " floor" are London Clay mixed with sand. Some-
times the tools and flakes are to be seen in this clay, but
of course they were washed into it in Palaeolithic times by
floods. Above the " floor" is sandy loam and loamy sand;
the uppermost part, and sometimes the whole of the
material above the "floor,'' is not water-laid; in other
words, it is one form of "trail ;" above this "trail,"
where the darker tint is engraved, is humus, with Neo-

With these tools, fossil bones, mostly broken, belonging
to the mammoth, horse, bison, and reindeer, occur with
broken tusks, teeth, and antlers of the same and other
animals; human bones and teeth I have never been able
to light on. I have, however, many times seen such tender
things as leaves, small pieces of wood and small crushed
branches, generally, especially is this the case with the
leaves, very friable. Molluscan remains in immediate con-
tact with the " floor '' sometimes occur, and I have seen
them both below and above it, and in contact with the bones
and implements. Three or four feet below the "floor,"
shells are sometimes very common. Both under aadm

clay, brought from a short distance to the nortwt

implements are also met with in the "trail," examples
no doubt caught up from old exposed surfaces by the ice-
sheet, and brought from a distance to their present
position. No Palaeolithic implements occur above the
"trail," the "trail " seals up all the relics of the Palaeo-
lithic age, and as far as the evidence of north-east
London goes, Palaeolithic man had quite retired before
the "trail" was deposited. When implements are found

Palaeolithic implements of medium age. All these tools
have been more or less moved and relaid by the agency

the deposition of the trail, and probably long after the
time when other immense blocks found at 20 feet and 30
feet at the bottom of the gravel were deposited. Some
show glacial striae. Generally in the deepest pits, the
third and oldest class of implements is found, the examples
are rudely made, massive, deeply ochreous in colour, with
a thick ochreous crust, the ochreous tint not derived from
the matrix they are now in; they are generally very much

long dashing about in water with other stones, but as the

were aroused by the earthquake shock which has caused so much
alarm and damage to the whole isthmus. The duration of the
shock was fully 60 seconds, and was so severe that the whole
populace rushed into the streets as rapidly as their feet could
carry them. About half an hour afterwards another shock was
felt, but much lighter than the first. A deep fissure was opened
in the earth from the south end of the freight-house for a dist-
ance of about 400 feet along the walk leading in the direction of
the ice-houses. Many buildings were moved slightly from their
foundations, but on the whole remarkably little damage was
done. On board the vessels in the harbour the shock was also
felt very severely. About 1 p.m. another much slighter shock
was felt, and during the succeeding night two more slight disturb-
ances were reported. It may be of meteorological interest to
observe that the sea at the time remained calm, the atmosphere
quite clear, and the stars and waning moon remarkably brilliant.
Soon after, say about 4 o'clock, a slight fog wafted from inland;
no rain fell. All day an ominous calm prevailed without
rain, with fluctuating barometer and excessive heat. Another
slight shock occurred at Panama on the morning of the 9th,
a little before 5 o'clock, but fortunately no damage was done.

The same shock was lightly felt in Colon and along the railroad
track. All day on Saturday no shock was felt, and the night
passed quietly. At mid-day on Saturday, there was a marked
change in the atmosphere, and, with a refreshing shower which
fell, the murky, sultry air of the previous days entirely disap-
peared. The rumours of a volcanic eruption at Chagres are
entirely without foundation. The earthquake was felt there, did
some little damage, and opened a few cracks in the ground. The
earthquake of the 7th was felt at the Pearl Islands, in the bay.
At Donoso, Govea, and Rio Indio a number of shocks were felt,
and the people were much frightened. At Miguel la Borda, 35
miles from Colon, in the direction of Bocas del Toro, the tide
rose to an unusual height and flooded some of the houses, which
are built on the beach almost on a level with the sea. The earth
sank in about a dozen places. The Governor of the district
writes officially that several boiling springs suddenly appeared,
some of which throw hot water to a considerable height. Letters
have been received from the towns of La Villa, Chitre, Macara-
ca>, arm Xata, all in the State, announcing that several shocks
have been felt, but that the material of which the houses are
builtbamboos and adobesresisted the movements, and they
suffered no damage. Two or three slight tremblings were
experienced in Panama during the night of the 12th, but they
caused no alarm, and many people were returning to their
houses.

An exceedingly ingenious patent for the manufacture at
ydro^en and oxygen has been taken out by M. N. A. Helouis,
f Paris. Wood charcoal is obtained by heating wood in closed
essels: the gas which is evolved is u ed for heating the retorts
1 which hydrogen and oxygen are produced, the tar is used for
lrburetting hydrogen, the lyroligneous acid is employed to
ecompose sodium sulphite (produced in another stage of the
rocess), whereby sulphurous acid and sodium acetate are ob-
tined. By passing steam over hot wood charcoal, a mixture of
ydrogen, carbon monoxide, and dioxide is obtained; the mixed
ases are passed into retorts containing heated gypsum, which is
educed by carbon monoxide to calcium sulphide; the escaping
urbon monoxide is absorbed by soda solution, giving sodium
icarbonate. Oxygen is obtained by decomposing gypsum (600
arts) by silica (340 parts river sand) ; the mixture ot sulphur
ioxide and oxygen which u produced, is passed into caustic
ada solution, whereby sodium bisulphite is formed; the resi-
ual sulpbur dioxide is absorbed by milk of lime. The calcium

In the same year I made a series of experiments on the other
magnetic metal, nickel and cobalt, and found that whilst cobalt
lengthened under magnetisation, nickel appeared to suffer no
change.1 This result is surprising, for nickel more nearly
resembles iron and cobalt than steel in magnetic properties, the
formei having little coercive force, and the latter very consider-
able retentive power. With entirely new apparatus the experi-
ments were repeated, and a distinct shortening of the nickel was
now found, cobalt elongating but not so much as iron. This
observation is, I believe, new, the fact was first noticed by me
on September 9, 1873, DUt some uncertainty as to the reliability
of the apparatus I then used led me to put the matter aside till
July, 1876, when the experiments were repeated, and the fact
that cobalt elongates and nickel retracts under magnetisation,
was fully confirmed.
The multiplying apparatus that was found to yield most satisfac-
tory results was a simple form of optical lever, a mirror vertically
fixed over the fulcrum of a lever of the first order, and reflecting
a scale at some distance into an observing telescope. The appa-
ratus will be more fully described in the report that will be pre-
sented next year; a committee, with a small money grant,

having been appointed at a previous meeting of the Association
to investigate this and certain other molecular changes accom-
panying the magnetisation of iron, described by the author at th:
Bradford meeting of the Association.
The results so far obtained may be summed up as follows:
However often the current traverses the helix around the bar of
cobalt, the elongation is practically the same after the first
current, and amounts to about two-thirds of the elongation pro-
duced in an iron bar of the same dimensions. In my measure-
ment the elongation of the iron amounted to about I-260,000th
of its length for the maximum magnetisation; the iron elongated
5 scale divisions, and the cobalt 3, or 1-425,oooth of its length.
With nickel, the retraction on the same scale was 10, or twice
the elongation of the iron, or about 1-130,oooth of the length of
the bar. Reversing the current made no alteration in the results.
The index returned promptly to zero on the cessation of the
current. The retraction of the nickel was so instantaneous that
it was only by noting the scale-reading that any motion could
be discovered to have taken place. The helix in all ca-es was
the whole length of the bars.
Inclosing the bars in a vessel of water terminating in a capil-
lary tube (the stem of a mercurial thermometer of extremely fine
bore), and surrounding the vessel by a powerful magnetising
helix, no motion of the water-level in the capillary tube was
noticed with iron and cobalt on the making, breaking, or re-
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
versing the current in the helix; with nickel no motion was
observed on making, and a barely perceptible, but still definite,
fall of the index, equal to about I -10,000,oooth of the volume
of the bar, occurred on breaking, which was more clearly seen
by frequent interruptions of the current.
The "magnetic tick " is heard loudly with cobalt and nickel,
as well as iron, the former giving a very clear metallic click on
magnetisation.
I am much indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Johnson and
Matthey for the bars of nickel and cobalt (cjj inches long and 1
inch diameter) with which the experiments were conducted, and
also to Mr. Gore, F.R.S., for the loan of a longer bar of nickel.
Experiments are now in progress to determine the effect of tem-
peratures and longitudinal tensions on the result.
Preliminary experiments show, that raising the temperature
of the iron and cobalt bars some 50' C. makes a scarcely appre-
ciable difference in the amount they elongate, whereas, when
nickel is heated the same amount, its retractio n on magnetisa-
tion is, as might be expected, considerably diminished, being
about three-fourths of the amount occurring at the temperature
of the air. Owing to the short length of the bars, the actual

Deviations being proportionate to abscissae, and measured
solar energies to ordinates, we have here (I) the distribution of
energy in the prismatic and (2) its distribution in the normal
spectrum. The total energy is in each case proportionate to the
area of the curve, (the two very dissimilar curves inclosing the
same area), and on each, if the total energy be roughly divided
into four parts, one of these will correspond to the visible, and
three to the invisible or ultra-red part. The total energy at the
ultra violet end, is so small then as to be here altogether
negligable.
\Ve observe that (owing to the distortion introduced by the
prism) the maximum ordinate representing the heat in the pris-
matic spectrum is, as observed by Tyndall, below the red, while
upon the normal scale this maximum ordinate is found in the
orange.
I would next ask your attention to the fact that in either
spectrum, below X= 12,000 are most extraordinary depressions
and interruptions of the energy, to which, as will be seen, the
visible spectrum offers no parallel. As to the agent producing

the curve, and as you see, in one place, cut it completely in two,
I have as yet obtained no conclusive evidence. Knowing the
great absorption of water vapor in this lowest region, as we
already do, from the observations of Tyndall, it would, a priori,
seem not unreasonable to look to it as the cause. On the other
hand, when 1 have continued observations from noon to sunset,
making successive measures of each ordinate, as the sinking sun
sent its rays through greater depths of absorbirg atmosphere; I
have not found thee gaps increasing, as much as they apparently
should, if due to a terrestrial cause, and so far as this evidence
goes, they might be rather thought to be solar. But my ow n
means of investigation are not so well adapted to decide this im-
portant point, as those of photography, to which we may yet
be indebted for our final conclusion.
I am led from a study of Capt. Abney's photographs of the
region between A.= 8,coo and \= 12,000, to think that these
gaps are produced by the aggregation of finer lines, which can
best be discriminated by the camera, an instrument, which
where it can be used at all, is far more sensitive than the bolo-
meter ; while the latter, I think, has on the other hand some
advantage in affording direct and trustworthy measures of the
amount of energy inhering in each ray.
- One reason why the extent of this great region has been so
singularly underestimated, is the deceptively small space into

which it appears to be compressed by the distortion of the
prism. To discriminate between these crowded rays I have
been driven to the invention of a special instrument. The
bolometer, which I have here, is an instrument depending upon
principles which I need not explain at length, since all present
may be presumed to be familiar with the success w hich has before
attended their application in another field, in the hands of the
President of this Association.
I may remark, however, that this special construction has
involved very considerable difficulties and long labour. For the
instrument here show n, platinum has been rolled by Messrs.
Tiffany, of New York, into sheets, which as determined by the
kindness of Frefissor Rood, reach the surprising tenuity of less
than yjjriff °f an English inch (I have al o iron rolled to -jjimr
inch), and from this platinum a strip is cut yj^ of an inch wide.
This minute strip, forming one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge,
and thus perfectly shielded from air currents, is accurately

The spectra formed by this, fall upon a screen in which is a
fine slit, only permitting nearly homogeneous rays to pass, and
these,- which may contain the rays of as many as four over-
lapping spectra, are next passed through a rock-salt or glass prism placed with its refracting edge parallel to the grating lines.
This sorts out the different narrow spectral images, without
danger of overlapping, and after their passage through the
prism we find them again and fix their position by means of the
bolometer, which for this purpose is attached to a s ecial kind
of spectrometer, where its platinum thread replaces the reticule
of the ordinary telescope. This is very difficult work, especially
in the lowermost spectrum, where I have spent over two weeks
of consecutive labour, in fixing a single wave-length.

All that has preceded is subordinate to the main re -_
which I have occupied the past two years at Allfjij
comparing the spectra of the sun at high and lew ilcte:-
which I must here touch upon briefly. By the geno-
friend of the Alleghany Observatory, and by the aid -
Hazen, Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. army, I was emis
year to organise an expedition to Mount Whitney a i
California, where the most important of these latterotse-r
were repeated at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Uponzrn
I made a special investigation upon the selective iterr
the sun's atmosphere, with results which I can sot
allude to.
By such observations, but by methods too elaborate L-1sent description, we can pass from the curve ot euervrr iz
observed, to that which would be seen, if the objenr n

to show conclusively that it would be blue. Not to rely on any
assumption, however, we have by various methods at Alleghany,
reproduced this colour.
Thus (to indicate roughly the principle used), taking three
Maxwell's discs, a red, green, and blue, so as to reproduce white,
we note the three corresponding ordinates at the earth's surface
spectrum, and comparing these with the same ordinates in the

would be seen ther?, and obtain by their revolution a tint which
must approximately represent that at the photosphere, and
which is most similar to that of a blue near Frauenhofer's " F."
The conclusion then is that while all radiations emanate from
the solar surface, including red and infrared, in greater degree
than we receive them, that the blue end is so enormously greater
in proportion, that the proper colour of the sun, as seen at the
photosphere, is bluenot only "bluish," but positively and

""THE localities at which definite results have been obtained
¦*¦ may thus be classified :
I. Metallic mines. 2. Coalmines. 3. Wells and wet borings.
4. Tunnels.
1. The mines at Przibram in Bohemia, with a depth of 1900
feet, are in very quartzose rock, and give a very slow rate of
increase, viz. 1° F in 135 feet. As all the shafts are in lofty
hills, an allowance of t\ may be made for convexity, leaving
i° F. in 126 feet. Quartz is found by Prof. Herschel to have a
conductivity of about '0086.
The mines at Schemnitz in Hungary, with a depth of 1368
feet, give an average rate of i° F. in 74 feet, the rock being a
green homblende-andesite (in German, Griinslein-Trachyt),

which is a compact, fine-grained, crystalline, more or less vitreous
rock. Prof. Lcbour estimates its conductivity as being probably
nearly the same as that of Calton Hill trap-rock, which Prof.
Herschel found to be about '0029.
2. The principal results from coal mines are as follows :
The mines of the Societe Cocqueril at Seraing (Belgium), with
a depth of 1657 feet, give an average rate of 1° F. in 50 feet.
The rock is coal shale. Prof. Herschel found for shale the low
conductivity 0019.
The mines of Anzin, in the north of France, with a depth of
658 feet, gave in the deepest shaft an increase of 1° in 47 feet.
Rosebridge Colliery, near Wigan, with a depth of 2445 feet,
gave a mean rate of 1° in 54 feet.
The four following are in the East Manchester coalfield :
Astley Pit, Dukinfield, with a depth of 2700 feet, gave a
mean rate of 1° in 72 feet.
Ashton Moss Colliery, with a depth of 2790 feet, gave 1° in
77 feet.
Bredbnry Colliery, with a depth of 1020 feet, gave 1° in 78-5
feet.
Nook Pit, with a depth of 1050 feet, gave 1° in 79 feet.

fell during this interval from 58°'I to 57°'0, would seem to indi-
cate an elevation of 1° due to the heat generated by the boring
tool. An assumed surface temperature of 49° (only r/'o, lower
than that of the Botanic Gardens in London) would give by
comparison with 57°, at 1004 feet, a rate of 1° in 125J feet, and
by comparison with 59°, at 1302 feet, a ra'e of 1° in 130 feet,
which lat may be adopted as the best determination. The
rock consists of the pebble beds of the Bunter or Lower Trias,
and the boring was executed at the rate of nearly Ico feet per
month.
The boring at Swinderby, near Scarle (Lincoln), in search of
coal, was carried to a depth of 2000 feet, with a diameter at the
lower part of only 3^ inches-a circumstance favourable to
accuracy, both as impeding convection and as promoting the
rapid escape of the heat of boring. The temperature at the
bottom was 79*, the water having been undisturbed for a month,
and this by comparison with an assumed surface temperature of
50° gives a rate of 1° in 69 feet.

The following results have been obtained from shallow
borings. The first three were made under Sir William Thom-
son's direction, with a thermometer which could be read by
estimation to hundredths of a degree :
Blythswood bore, near Glasgow, with a depth of 347 feet,
gave a very regular increase of 1° in 50 feet.
Kirkland Neuk bore, in the immediate vicinity of the above,
gave consistent observations at different seasons of the year from
180 feet to the bottom (354 feet), the rate being 1° in 53 f;et.
This bore passed through coal which had been "very much
burned or charred."
.^outh Balgray bore, near Glasgow, and north of the Clyde,
with an available depth of 525 feet, gave by comparing the
temperature at the bottom with that at 60 feet a rate of 1°
in 41 feet.
Shale extends continuously from 390 to 450 feet from the
surface, and the increase in these 60 feet of shale was 2° 02,
which is at the rate of 1° in 30 feet. This rapid increase agrees
with the fact that shale has very low conductivity, averaging
'0019 in Prof. Herschel's experiments.
The only small bore remaining to be mentioned is that at
Manegaon, in India, which had 310 feet available, and gave by
comparing the temperature at this depth with that at 60 feet a
rate of I in 68 feet. The rocks consist of fine softish sand-

stones and hard silty clays, the dip being 10°.
4. Tunnels.The Mont Cenis tunnel, which is about seven
miles long, is at a depth of exactly a mile (5280 feet) be-
neath the crest of Mont Frejus overhead. This was the
warmest part of the tunnel, and had a temperature of 85° 1 F.
The mean air temperature at the crest overhead was calculated
by the engineer of the tunnel, M. Giordano, by interpolating
between the known temperature of the hill of San Theo-
dale and that of the city of Turin, the former being 430 metres
higher, and the latter 2650 metres lower, than the point in
question. It is thus calculated to be - 2°'6 C. or 27°*3 F. If,
according to our usual rule, we assume the ground to be 1°
warmer than the air, we have 2S°3 to compare with 85°'I. This
gives a rate of 1° in 93 feet; but, inasmuch as the convexity of
the surface increases the distance between the isotherms, a cor-
rection will be necessary before we can fairly compare this result
with rates under level ground. As a rough estimate we may
take I of 93, and adopt 1° in 79 feet, as the corrected result.

underground thermometers at three stations at Edinburgh,
>mbined with laboratory measurement of the specific heats and
ensities of the n cks in which the thermometers were planted.
he specific heats were determined by Regnaulr, and the
ensities by Forbes. Specific heats and densities can be deter-
mined wiih great accuracy in the laboratory, but the direct
etermination of conductivity in the laboratory is exceedingly
ifiicult, it being almost impossible to avoid sources of error
vhich make the conductivity appear less than it really is.
Prof. Herschel, in conjunction with a Committee of the
3ritish Association, has made a very extensive and valuable
series of direct measurements of the conductivities of a great
variety of rocks, and has given additional certainty to his results
iy selecting as two of the subjects of his experiments the Calton
Hill Trap and Craigleith sandstone, to which Sir William
Thomson s determinations apply.
From combining Prof. Herschel's determinations with those
of Sir Win. Thomson, 0058 is adopted as the mean conduc-
tivity of the outer crust of the earth, which, being multiplied by
the mean rate of increase, ^00285, gives
16330 x 10-10
as vhe flow of heat in a second across a square centimetre.

Multiplying by the number of seconds in a year, which is
approximately 314 millions, we have
633 X 315 x 10-4= 41 4.
This, then, is our estimate of the aveiage number of gramme-
degrees of heat that escape annually through each square centi-
metre of a horizontal section of the earth's substance.

THE BURMAN
The Burman: his Life and Notions. By Shway Yoe,
Subject of the Great Queen. (London: Macmillan and
Co., 1882.)
TH E author of these two lively little volumes tells us
that Shway Yoe is the name he is known by in
Burma (Shway means " Golden," and is a common Bur-
mese epithet). He himself writes in the character of a
Burman, but Englishmen who have lived in the country
say that there is no native capable of having written a
page of such a book. Accordingly, while respecting the
writer's incognito, we must consider him to be an English-
man who does not care to publish his name; tut whoever
he is, it is plain he knows the land and its language and
ways intimately. To Europeans going there, his work
will be a guide of practical value, the more so because
their difficulties so often arise from misunderstandings
which knowledge of native habits would prevent. For
example, an Englishman, eager to push forward on his
journey on a Saturday, is furious because his servants
cannot be got to buy bullocks for the cart till next day.

He declares it is dilatoriness or the desire to stay and see
some feast, whereas the real reason is that the day is un-
lucky" it is a matter of conscience, and was taught to
the Burman in a rhyme when he was a little boy at
school." On the other hand, the Englishman himself
gets into trouble when out shooting by going on regardless
of a finger-post which gives notice that a monastery lies
near, and that animals must not be killed there. While
the lay Burmese are generally rather slack in condemning
violations by hunters and fishers of the Buddhist law not
to take life, and indeed are not averse to enjoying the re-
sults in the shape of curry and strong-smelling fish-paste
yet it would be too much to expect such profanation to be
allowed under the very eyes of the holy ascetics. Another
way here mentioned in which our English officials both
take and give offence, really arises out of an idea belong-
ing to the early philosophy of religion having survived
with great tenacity in this corner of the globe. The Bur.
mese have not yet come to our advanced opinion that
dreams are mere subjective impressions of the sleeper's
mind. The animistic view still prevails that dreaming is the
actual experience of the person's life or soul, which they
conceive to go forth from his body in butterfly-shape
and flutter about; this leip-bya, as it is called, only going
to places its owner has visited before, which accounts for

dreams being of known localities. The working-out of
this theory as to the causes of disease and death (vol. ii.,
chap, xi.) is a good specimen of the author's style. It is
because of the absence of the butterfly that the Burmese
(like other peoples in the same intellectual stage) are un-
willing to wake a sleeping man, for his spirit might be
wandering far away and not have time to get back, so
that its owner would fall ill. Foreigners do not always
understand this primitive biology.
"An English assistant commissioner rides unexpectedly

decay in the sophistry by which they are kept in form
while violated in reality. Buddhists who lead the ascetic
life are bound to support themselves by carrying round
the almsbowl from house to house, not asking for any-
thing, nor going to the doors of the rich rather than the
poor, but taking what is given, and eating with loathing
so much as is necessary to prevent death. The alms-
bowl is still the sign of the holy man, and he carries it
round, but it is only in the severest monasteries that he
really eats the indiscriminate bits of fish and flesh and
handfuls of rice and mango. The mess generally goes
to the little boy-scholar?, and after them to the crows
and pariah dogs, while the monks set to on a comfortable
hot breakfast in the monastery. With like ingenuity the
ascetic will sit with his back to the sun, so that he does
not know when it is afternoon, and can take another meal
without breaking the law; while some, mindful of the law
not to touch money, will wrap their hands in a cloth and
then take it. Among the casuistic points which the student
of morals finds most curious in theoretical and practical
Buddhism is that alluded to already, how in a religion

where the taking of life is one of the five great sins, even
the monks receive fish and meat in their almsbowls, and
every village is pervaded by the smell of nga-pee, which
seems to go far beyond that of anchovy sauce, its nearest
English correlative. The answer is, that if necessity
drives a man to the wicked life of killing animals, he will pay the penalty in ages of misery in future states, but he
who eats the meat is no way responsible. Even the
fisherman finds his way out of the loose-meshed moral
net:
"Fishermen are promised terrible punishments in a
future life for the number of lives they take, but popular
sympathy finds a loophole of escape for them. They do
not actually kill the fish. These are merely put out on
the bank to dry after their long soaking in the river, and
if they are foolish and ill-judged enough to die while
undergoing the process, it is their own fault."
The passage of which this is part (vol. i. p. 341) may
be recognised as coming from Prof. Adolf Bastian's
"Reisen in Binna," which forms the second volume of
his " Voelker des Oestlichen Asien." Of this important
book, which has not been translated into English, the
present author has in several places made use.

nations, re-appearing among this Mongoloid race of
South-Eastern Asia. Thus as the ordeal by water has in
India the authority of the Code of Manu, it is not sur-
prising that ducking witches is a mode of trial familiar
to the Burmese; our officials now prohibit it in British
territory, possibly not telling the natives how lately we
did it ourselves. Another superstition here noticed, is
that a Burmese prizes a child's c.iul as much as an English
sailor does. The one may expect by its means to gain the
favour of some great man, while the other carries it to

THE work before us is another evidence of Prof.
Strasburger's untiring industry and minute research.
Interesting as all his books have been, this one may be
said to surpass its predecessors in this respect, inasmuch
as the questions with which it deals are of such fundamental
importance in botanical science. The main object of the
researches here published is to throw light upon two diffi-
cult and much-discussed points, namely, the intimate
structure of organised bodies, and the mode of growth of
         Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:13 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
cell-walls and starch-grains. With regard to the re-
searches themselves it need only be said that they appear
to have been carried out with Prof. Strasburger's accus-
tomed thoroughness and accuracy, and that they are
abundantly illustrated by beautiful drawings. The con-
clusions deduced from them are so remarkable that a brief
re'sume' will not be out of place.
With regard to the intimate structure of organised
bodies, Prof. Strasburger entirely dissents from that view
which is known to all botanists as Naegeli's micellar
hypothesis.1 This hypothesis was based upon the pheno-
mena of "swelling-up" which are so characteristic of
organised bodies, and upon the optical properties which
certain of these bodies possess. Prof. Strasburger points
out that swelling-up may be as well ascribed to the
taking-up of water between the molecules of the body as
to its being taken up between Naegeli's micellae. He
shows also in a striking manner that the double refraction
of organised bodies, such as cell-walls and starch-grains,
depends upon their organisation as a whole, for when
once their organisation is destroyed their double refrac-
tion is lost, a result which cannot be explained on the
micellar theory since the particles of the disintegrated
micellae would, like particles of broken crystals, still
retain their double refraction. According to Prof. Stras-
         Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
burger the molecules of an organised body are not aggre-
gated into micellae which are held together by attraction,
but they are linked together, probably by means of multi-
valent atoms, by chemical affinity in a reticulate manner.
Swelling-up is then the expression of the taking-up of
water into the meshes of the molecular reticulum, where
it is retained by intermolecular capillarity. The more
extensible the reticulum, that is, the more mobile the
groups of molecules within their position of equilibrium,
the greater the amount of swelling-up. The limit is
reached when the chemical affinity of the molecules and
the force of the intermolecular capillarity are equal; if
the lattei exceed the former at any moment the result is
the destruction of the molecular reticulum, or, in other
words, of the organisation. Protoplasm differs from

other organised bodies in that the grouping of its mole-
cules is undergoing perpetual change, the result of this
molecular activity being the phenomena which we term
vital.
The growth in thickness of cell-walls and of starch-

produced in the same way. The cell-plate, like the
peripheral layer of the protoplasm of a young pollen-
grain, contains microsomata which disappear, and it is
then converted into a plate of cellulose. Finally, the
successive layers of a starch-grain are produced by the
alteration into starch of layers of proteid-substance
derived from the starch-forming corpuscle (amyloplast).
Besides dealing thoroughly with these main points,
Prof. Strasburger touches upon others which are also of
great importance. He points out that the starch which
makes its appearance in the chlorophyll-corpuscles under
the influence of light, is derived from the proteid of the
corpuscles by dissociation. The formation of this starch
is therefore not the immediate product of the synthetic
processes going on in the chlorophyll-corpuscles, but only
a mediate product. The processes in question produce
proteid. Prof. Strasburger is inclined to accept Erlen-
meyer's hypothesis, that methyl aldehyd is formed in the
chlorophyll-corpuscles from carbonic dioxide and water
and to believe that by polymerisation a substance is pro-
duced which can combine with the nitrogenous residues

of previous dissociations of proteid to reconstitute proteid.
He does not agree with the suggestion of Loew and
Bokorny that the methyl aldehyd may combine with
ammonia and sulphur to form proteid de novo.
Lastly, Prof. Strasburger makes an interesting sugges-
tion as to the probable physiological significance of the
nucleus. He points out that the nucleus cannot be re-
garded as regulating cell-division, for instances are known
of cell-division taking place without previous nuclear
division, and, conversely, of nuclear division taking
place without cell-division. He is of opinion that the
nucleus plays an important part in the formation of
proteid in the cell. This view is founded upon the facts
that one or more nuclei have been found to be present in
the vast majority of plant-cells, that the nucleus is, as a
general rule, the most persistent protoplasmic structure,
and that it gives the various proteid reactions in a very
marked manner. Sydney H. Vines

The Behaviour of Sulphate of Lead in a Secondary
Battery
Since the meeting of the British Association at Southampton
I have made several experiments on the action of sulphate of
lead at the negative pole of a decomposition cell, with a view
to ascertain, not whether the sulphate was reduced in bulk
by the action of the nascent hydrogen, a matter concerning
which I had satisfied myself before in the negative, but the less
practically important matter whether any trace of metallic lead
could be obtained upon the negative plate by this action.
I used, therefore, platinum electrodes, immersing them in a
]>aste of sulphate of lead in dilute sulphuric acid And at the
suggestion of Prof. McLeod, in order to obtain sulphate pure
and in a fine : tite of subdivision, I precipitated a quantity from
dissolved carbonate.
The paste soon settled down, leaving about a quarter of an
inch of clear liquid above it, which was decanted off. Small
thick platinum plates stood in the paste about 2 inches apart,
and were connected with either three or two Lechlancht ct

On the Conservation of Solar Radiation
Ix appears to me a difficulty arises with regard to Dr. Siemens'
heory when we consider the original condition of the earth and
>f the other planets. What, in fact, has become of the great
amount of energy which was present in the form of heat in those
bodies?
J ust as in the case of the sun, the rotation of the earth would
produce a continuous cycle current, the decrease of rotatory
energy being perhaps counterbalanced by shrinkage, the radiant
heat would become transformed into the potential energy of dis-
sociation, and this energy again would be given back to the
earth in the form of heat in another part of the circuit where the
elements recombine. Now it is quite impossible that the whole
of the heat radiated should be used in this way, for after a lapse
of years we should find a considerable diminution of potential,
or (perhaps) rotatory energy, and we therefore should be forced
to the conclusion that the earth became continually hotter.

Hence some of the radiant heat escaped must have escaped into
space, never to return.
Is it then a feasible solution that more heat is radiating from
the sun than is necessary for the dissociation of the elements?
If so, then at least we should have a satisfactory explanation of
its slowly-diminishing activity. G. B. S.
The writer of this letter is right in concluding that in accord-
ance with my hypothesis the earth also must throw out a stream
of matter equatorially into space; and if your correspondent
will refer to my article in the Nineteenth Century of April
last, he will find that at p. 522 I speak of such a terrestrial out-
flow, with which I connect the phenomena of Aurora Rorealis.
If at any period of the world's history the rotatory velocity of the
earth has been much greater than it is now, and its surface-
temperature sufficiently high to cause ignition of combustible
gases, it may be reasonably supposed that it had the power of
recuperating its heat of radiation. The amount of heat so
recuperated would, under all circumstances, be less than that
received back by combustion, and the result of gradual diminu-
tion of temperature would be that on a certain day the tempera-
ture must have fallen below the point of ignition, from which day
forward no further recuperation of heat could be expected. The
process of cooling would then proceed at a very rapid ratio,
until the surface-temperature bad reached another point of com-
parative constancy, at which the radiation into space was balanced

the British Association at their late meeting at South-

bridge, it must have given extensive information on the
character of the structure. Yet it seems to me that,
amidst many valuable particulars, on the strength of
materials, their mode of application in this instance, and
similar important subjectsit would hardly impress
sufficiently, upon the minds of hearers or readers, the
vastness of the scheme, the novelty of its arrangements,

may be subject. I have thought therefore that I might,
without impropriety, offer to the editor of Nature some
remarks on points which after careful consideration have
suggested themselves to me. For some particulars I am
indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Fowler himself, and I
greatly value this kindness.
It is known that at Queensferry the separation of the
river-banks, or rather that of the piers next to the banks,
at the elevation required for the railway, approaches to a
mile. This space is divided by three piers (for which
there are excellent foundations on rock and hard clay)
into four parts, but only the two middle parts concern us
now. They are exactly similar, and are treated in exactly
the same way; and subsequent allusions, referring
ostensibly to one, are to be considered as applicable to
both. Each of the three piers is an iron frame, 350 feet
high, the central pier 270 feet wide (in the direction of
length of the bridge), and each of the others 150 feet.
These lofty frames are braced, each upper angle on one
side to lower angle on the other side, with no other
diagonal bracing, but with a simple tie at mid-height.
The lengths of the diagonal bracing are respectively
about 430 and 360 feet. The water-spaces between two
piers are each about 1700 feet; and the engineering ques-
tion now is, how this space of 1700 feet (roughly one-

third of a mile) is to be bridged for the passage of a
railway.
The plan proposed is, to attach to each side of each
frame (that is, to each side which will face a traveller
entering upon the bridge) a framed cantilever or bracket
about 675 feet long (that is, exceeding in length an
English furlong by 15 feet), attached at top and bottom
to the iron frame above mentioned, but having no other
support in its entire length of 675 feet. To give the
reader a practical idea of the length of "this bracket, I
remark that the length of St. Paul's Cathedral, outside to
outside, is exactly 500 feet; and thus this bracket, which
is to project over the water without any support whatever,
is longer than the Cathedral by 175 feet. This in itself is
enough to excite some fear, supposing the bracket to
support merely its own weight. But further, the bracket
bears also the very considerable weight of the roadway
and rails. It is also heavily loaded on its point. The
two opposing brackets from the two iron frames cover
1350 feet, but the whole space to be covered is 1700 feet,

upper bar). With this enormous load at this stupendous
height, would the citizens of London in the Churchyard
below feel themselves in perfect security? I think not;
and I claim the same privilege of entertaining the sense
of insecurity for the proposed Forth Bridge.
The danger arising from the endwise action of so large
a force on so long a bar or frame, is produced by the
curvature technically called "buckling," and there
appears to be fear of its occurrence in various parts of
the bracket, and in some parts sequentially, that is to say. that a buckling of a minor order might lead to a buckling
of a more important order. Thus, proceeding from the
pier, the first support of the great lower bar is by a
suspension-rod from the great upper bar; to which, as
regards merely the suspension-rod, there can be no
objection. But the upper attachment of this suspension-
rod is supported by a thrust-rod about 340 feet long. Can
this rod be considered safe against buckling? In the
total absence of experiment or explanation, I may be
permitted to express a doubt of safety. And if that rod
fail, the corresponding part of the great lower bar will
sink, it will buckle under its enormous end-thrust, and

the bridge will be ruined. The second support of the
great lower bar depends, in like manner, on a thrust-rod
whose length is z&a feet; considerations of the same kind
apply to it, though probably in a minor degree.
Experienced engineers must have known instances in
which buildings have failed from want of consideration
of buckling. The following occurred within my know-
ledge. When the Brunswick Theatre was built, the con-
struction of its trussed iron roof was greatly extolled,
and Mr. Whewell and myself, then residing at Cam-
bridge, and proposing to visit London about the same
time, had arranged to inspect the truss. But before we
reached London it was ruined. There was no adequate
bracing of the principal rafters in the plane of the roof;
the suspension of a very slight weight on the great tie
caused the rafters to buckle sideways, and the roof fell,
destroying the building.
I am not aware whether a theory of bucWing finds
place in any of the books which treat of engineering in a
somewhat mathematical form. But there ought to be
such. It can be formed with no difficulty and little
trouble, giving such a form of result, that all that will be
required in any case, to determine the end-pressure which
can safely be applied to the end of a bar, will be ex-
pressed in terms of the length of the bar, and the curva-

ture caused by a tranversal strain (determined by simple
experiment). This theorem ought to be applied in every
instance.
I need scarcely to remark that every construction is
liable to chance-errors of unforeseen character, and I
think that the proposed construction, which depends for
its safety entirely on the maintenance of the thrust-prin-
ciple in perfection, is more liable than any other to
danger from these causes. A rivet-head may slip, or a
screw may strip, and all may be imperilled. Robert
Stephenson, when building the Menai Bridge, used every
caution that an active mind could invent: in particular
be provided that the masonry for final support of the
tubes should be raised as quickly as possible to take the
bearing of the tubes at every moment. Yet an accident,
though a small one, did happen. The ends of the tubes were raised by the power of hydraulic presses; the
cylinder of one of the^e presses burst, and the end of the
tube fell three or four inches. This minute fall, in
the judgment of the attendant engineers, gave a strain
to the tube such as it never sustained before or since.

1. Suppose the stone or iron piers to be much lower
than in the plans hitherto proposed, and suppose that the
top of a pier carries a bracket on each side, so that the
great suspending chain passes over the points of the
brackets, and its suspending action begins at those points.
The bracket frame may be horizontal where it passes the
top of the pier; or it may be raised in a horn on each
side, and thus adapted to a smaller height of pier. By
this construction, with brackets 150 feet long(a trifle com-
pared with those of the proposed cantilevers), the piers
may without difficulty be shortened 200 feet, and the
acting-length of suspending chain may be reduced 150
feet at each end, or 300 feet over each water-channel.
This would leave much liberty in regard to the curvature
¦of the chain.
2. It is very desirable, if possible, to reduce the specific
weight of the chains per yard, corresponding to a specified

Appendix
Having adverted above to the measurement of the end-
wise or '"buckling" force upon a bar, I will here give a
theory, by application of which the admissible amount of
end-pressure in any case may be ascertained.
The curvature of any point of a bar depends upon the
.action of two causes. The first cause is the external force,
whose angular momentum or effect to bend the bar at any
.point tinder consideration is proportional to the produ:t
of the force (expressed in multiples of a definite unitas
the pound avoirdupois, or the ton, &c.) by the distance of
.its line of action from the point under consideration
(expressed in multiples of the inch, or the foot, &c). The
second cause is the internal elastic force of the bar pro-
duced by curvature, whose tendency is to oppose the
bending action of the external force; I shall assume the
magnitude of this force to be proportional to the curva-
ture, or inversely proportional to the radius of curvature,
at the point under consideration, its coefficient being for
the present expressed only as a symbol. The effects of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
these two causes balance in a quiescent position of the
bar, and they must therefore be made algebraically
equal.
The course of investigation will now be as follows : -
'First, I shall give the equation between force and curva-
ture when a bar is bent by a transversal force, acting at
the middle of its length. Second, 1 shall give the similar
equation when a bar, at least slightly bent, is exposed to
an end-wise force. {The condition "slightly bent" is
necessary to exclude the absurdity of a very heavy weight
supported end-ways by a very thin wire.} In both cases
the results will contain the symbolical coefficient to which
I have lately alluded. From the first investigation I shall
deduce the value of that co efficient. I shall substitute it
in the result of the second investigation; and finally,
shall obtain a most convenient expression for the largest
admissible force acting endwise on the bar.

and therefore we
nust consider E = o. The solution therefore is restricted

r = o, this must = B. Therefore the solution is
Now here we have a very remarkable circumstance,t will be remembered that in the first investigation we
arrived at a relation between w, the weight, and b, the
greatest ordinate of the curve. But here we find no
relation whatever; and we come to this conclusion, that
for the state of equilibrium fundamentally assumed, the
degree of bulge of the bar is immaterial. And this
agrees with plain reasoning: by varying the bulge of the
bar, we vary in equal proportions, (1) the elasticity which
depends on that bulge and on the general curvature, and
(2) the distance of the line of action of W from each
joint p, and its consequent angular momentum; and
therefore, if they are equal for one degree of bul ^e, they
vestigations apply to the same bar. And thus, in order
to ascertain the limiting buckling force, we need only to

ascertain by experiment on the same bar the amount of
bend produced by any convenient transversal force.
In some cases, instead of making the first measure by
application of the weight w to act horizontally on the
middle of the bar, it may be more convenient to make a
measure of the vertical flexure of the bar (supported at its
two endi in a free horizontal position), produced by its
own weight The following will be the corresponding
theory.
(Third). Use the diagram of the first investigation,

weight of the bar: and estimate the angular mo-

pursuits, and commenced his career as a chemist, the

ardent experimentalist in the domain of chemical physics,

photography with a zeal which those alone who had the
pleasure of his acquaintance can estimate. The Monck-
hoven solar enlarging apparatus is a standing record of
his great ability in this department of science. At a very early period of his career he applied the spectroscope to

organic bodies, and his photographic researches on the

his time; his very latest published work, presented
recently to the Acaddmie des Sciences, being on the effect
of temperature and pressure on hydrogen. Whilst
Science, for herself, had charms for Van Monckhoven,
yet he was able to put to commercial use much of
the knowledge which he had acquired. For instance,
he entered with enthusiasm into the mysteries of carbon
printing, and established a factory for the production
of the necessary tissue. Indeed the Monckhoven's tissue
is the only one which enters into any sort of competition
with that manufactured by the Autotype Company. Again
to perfect the preparation of the latest photographic
noveltygelatine plateshe rushed into researches with
all the ardour of an experimentalist, and having more or
less mistered its intricacy, he established a manufactory
for their commercial issue, and probably the Monckhoven
plates are better known on the Continent than any other.
Van Monckhoven, besides being the author of the trea-
tise on photography, contributed many memoirs to
various periodicals, amongst which we may name La
Lumiere, Le Bulletin Beige, and La Revue des deux
Mondes. His style was vigorous, and everything he
had to say was written with a terseness which many a
busy scientific man may envy. In reviewing Van Monck-
hoven's life we cannot point to any great discovery

or to any startling inventions he made, but he was
one of those men who are so useful to science, giving, as
it were, the decorations to the more solid building. We
are sure that though there may be greater names,
there is scarcely one which is more universally known
than his, and whose loss will be more universally felt.
There are not many who can claim to be distinguished as
an astronomer, a chemist, an optician, and photo-chemist,
Van Monckhoven could make good his claim to such dis-
tinction, and withal to be a busy man in the world of
commerce.
Within a short time of his death he was engaged in an
important research on the influence of pressure and tem-
perature on the spectra of gases, in which he had intro-
duced quite a new method of attack, and one which
promised to be of great value.

minium in the first instance with a considerable amount
of sulphuric acid. This gave us a mixture which, on
analysis, was found to contain 185 per cent, of sulphate
of lead. This mixture, when submitted to the reducing
action of a current yielded a mass of spongy lead that
contained only a mere trace of sulphate.
As it seemed desirable fully to establish the fact that
the sulphate of lead formed on the discharge of a
cell is reduced in the subsequent charging, we took the
quondam lead plate of a fully discharged cell, determined
the proportion of sulphate to unaltered spongy lead, and
submitted it to the reducing action of a current. The
amount of sulphate on the plate before passing the cur-
rent was found to be 51 per cent., but, after the passage
of a current, of about an ampere for 60 hours, not a trace
of it remained.
Hence it may be concluded that, during the alternate
discharging and re-charging of a Plante" or Faure cell,
sulphate of lead is alternately formed and reduced on the
lead plate, and that the plate itself is not seriously cor-
roded. It would, however, appear desirable not to allow

the whole of the spongy lead to be reduced to sulphate
during the discharge, for two reasons, viz. : (1) because
the supporting plate stands a chance of being itself acted
on if there is not a sufficient excess of spongy metal; and
(2) because the presence of this excess tends to facilitate
the reduction of the sulphate.
We have already shown that sulphate of lead is pro-
duced by the local action that takes place between the
peroxide and its supporting lead plate during repose. The
same local action also takes place during the charging of
the plate, as was pointed out in our second communica-
tion, and this sulphate is, in its turn, attacked by the
electrolytic oxygen. In this way the absorption of oxygen
in forming the negative plate ought never to come to an
end. In order to see whether this was the case, we
allowed an experiment to continue for 115 hours, although
the main action was over in about forty hours. For the
last two days of the experiment, the amount of oxygen
absorbed was pretty constant, being about 9 c c. per
hour, which is equivalent to 0-24 grms. of sulphate of lead
formed and oxidated. The whole charge on the plate
was forty grms. of peroxide. This local action also takes
place during the discharge, as is evidenced by the sulphate
of lead formed on the negative plate always exceeding in
amount that formed on the positive plate.

Through this local action taking place during the for-
mation of the cell, during repose, and during the dis-
charge, the lead plate which supports the peroxide must
be continually corroded more and more; and it is
probably due to the insolubility of the sulphate formed
that ihe destruction of this kind of secondary battery
is so materially retarded in practice.

the south-eastern coast of the continent from Port Phillip
to Moreton Bay, and the cedar-bushes of the mountain
ranges of the interior. It is apparently confined to the
south-east of Australia. It is recluse in its habits, hiding
in the day time in the dense foliage of the eucalypti or
native gum trees, so that without the aid of the natives it
is not easily detected. By these, however, it is readily
discovered, and captured by the aid of their waddies or
iniowing-sticks. It is exceedingly tenacious of life,
clinging to the branches after being shot until perfectly
dead.
The Koala, when full grown, is about 2 feet in length,
and about 18 inches in girth. The limbs are strong and
muscular, and the long clawed feet are well adapted to its
arboreal habits. On the fore-feet the two innermost toes
are so arranged that they form, as it were, a double
thumb, and act against the three outer, thus giving to the
foot the grasping power of a hand ; whilst on the hinder
foot the inner toe is very large, nailless, and thumb-like,
and acts against the four long-clawed outer toes in a
manner resembling that of the thumb. The head is

in the adult are fully two inches in length, and on the
outer side of the ears are of the same grey hue as the rest
of the body. The fur covering the body is long, soft,
and rather woolly; the general colour may be described
as ashy-grey, with an under-tint of brown.
The natives of Australia are said to be very fond of the
flesh of the Kaola, and readily join in the pursuit of it;
they examine with wonderful rapidity and minuteness the
branches of the loftiest gum tree, and upon discovering a
Koala, they climb the treee with as much ease and expe-
dition as a European would mount a tolerably high
ladder. Having reached the branches, which are some-
times forty or fifty feet from the ground, they follow the
animal to the extremity of a bough, and either kill it with
a tomahawk, or take it alive.

THE ROT IN SHEEP, OR THE LIFE-HISTORY

outbreak of the liver-rot amongst our sheep. The
losses during that winter were estimated at three million
sheep, or about one-tenth of the total number in the
United Kingdom, and during the following winter the
losses were equally severe. It had long been known that
the disease was due to the presence in large numbers of
a parasite called the liver-fluke {Fasciola kepatica) in
the liver of the affected animals, and that the parasite in-
vaded sheep or sometimes other animals allowed to feed
on wet pastures, and especially on flooded ground. But
notwithstanding that the question had been repeatedly
investigated by numerous zoologists, including Prof.
Leuckart, so well known for his researches on parasites,
the manner in which the disease was incurred remained

a complete mystery. It was known indeed that the animals
most nearly allied to the liver-fluke, the digenetic Trema-
todes, presented an alternation of generations, and that
they possessed larval forms infesting various species of
molluscs. These nurse-forms, as they are called, produce
internally larvae, usually tailed, known as cercariae, which
leave the nurse and encyst themselves in some other
mollusc or in aquatic insect larvae, Sec, and remain there
quiescent, only reaching maturity if swallowed together
with the animal harbouring them by some suitable verte-
brate host. Such is a typical instance of the develop-
ment of a trematode with alternation of generations, but
there is a good deal of variety in the life-histories of the
different species. It was supposed that the liver-fluke
had a somewhat similar life-history, but all attempts to
discover what mollusc served as intermediate host had
been fruitless.
The Royal Agricultural Society of England was in-
duced by the heavy losses of sheep in 1879-80 to offer a
grant for the investigation of the natural history of this
most destructive parasite. I undertook the research, and

i many as 500 specimens at a single sweep of a small
hand-net. The low-lying meadows near the river were
covered with the flood waters, and when these subsided
the snails were left scattered broadcast over the fields.
The snail is almost the smallest species of Limnseus; the
variety which I found so abundantly was only a quarter
of an inch long when fully grown. Although it is a
water-snail it lives much out of water. My observations
have convinced me that the individuals left by floods on
the fields continue to live out of water so long as the
ground is moist. Their numbers are recruited by others
which crawl out of neighbouring ditches or streams. If
a drought occurs they become dormant, but unless too
long continued they revive with the first shower of rain.
On discovering these snails I immediately started infection experiments with them, and was at once successful.
The adult fluke in the liver of the sheep or other mam-
nalian host produces vast quantities of eggs. So prolific
is it that I have estimated the number produced by each
luke to be at least several hundred thousand. The eggs
pass with the bile into the intestines and are distributed
over the fields with the manure. If the eggs fall on to

wet ground, or are washed into a ditch, development
continues, and after a time, the length of which depends
upon the temperature, embryos are hatched out of the
eggs. For the purpose of my infection experiments I
obtained eggs from the livers of affected sheep, and kept
them in water until the embryos were hatched, and then
transferred them to vessels containing the snails to be
experimented upon.
The embryo of the liver-fluke has the shape of an elongated cone with rounded apex; its average length is
J 25 mm., or about 1/200 of an inch; its breadth at the anterior end about one-fifth of this. The broader end or base of the cone is always directed forwards, and in the centre of this a short retractile head-papilla. The whole of the surface, with the exception of the head-papilla, is covered with very long cilia, by means of which it swims, with head-papilla drawn in, swiftly and restlessly through the water. It is exceedingly active; sometimes it goes rapidly forwards, and then rotates on its longitudinal axis, just turning a little from side to side as if searching for something. At other times, by curving its body, it sweeps round in circles, or, curving itself still more strongly, spins round and round without moving from the spot. The cilia are carried by an outer layer of flattened
ectoderm cells arranged in five or six transverse rings around the body,and are of the same length over the whole of the surface. The first ring is composed of four cells arranged around the papilla, and these are thicker than the other outer cells, often forming projections at the side of the embryo and resembling epaulets. Beneath these ciliated cells is the body wall proper, and within this are a number of delicate vesicular cells  the germinal cells. Behind the head-papilla is a rudimentary digestive
tract The body-wall contains, near the anterior end, a double eye-spot, composed of crescentic masses of dark pigment, placed with their convex sides turned towards
each other.
When the embryo, in moving through the water, comes
in contact with any object, it pauses for a moment, and
feels about as if trying to discover its nature, and if not
satisfied darts off hastily again. But if the object be a
Limnaus truncatulus it at once begins to bore. Under
ordinary conditions the head-papilla of the embryo is
short and blunt, but as soon as the animal begins to
bore it becomes longer, conical, and pointed. The
embryo spins round on its axis, the cilia working vigour-
ously and pressing the embryo against the surface of the
snail. This pressure is increased by the body of the
embryo being alternately drawn up and then suddenly
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
extended. As the papilla sinks further into the tissues of
the snail it becomes longer and longer until it reaches
five times its original length, and the tissues of the snail
are forced apart as if by a wedge, leaving a gap through
which the embryo squeezes its way into the snail.
Tne embryo will not bore into all snails alike; the
only other species which I have found it bore into froji
without is Limnauspereger, and even here the specimens
have always been such as were still very small. I have
found embryos enter certain other snails, such as Planorbis,
but only from eggs which had been swallowed by the snail
and had been hatched in the digestive tract. This differ-
ence seems to be due to an instinctive choice on the part
of the embryo, rather than to a greater softness of the
tissues in Limnaus truncatulus. The tissues of Physa
fontinalis, for instance, appear to be equally soft, but I
have found that if these two species are placed in a
small bulk of water with a very large number of embryos, the Limnaei will be found on dissection to contain
fifty or more embryos, whilst the Physa will be entirely
free from them.

parent shell, moving in the snail's liver. So great is the
injury done, that in the laboratory, at any rate, very few
snails survive three weeks from infection.
The redia increases in size, and may ultimately reach
the length of 1 -3 mm. or about one-twentieth of an inch. It
resembles in every respect the rediae I formerly described
as found in the same snail at Wytham. Its contents of
spherical cells arranged themselves into round germs as
in the sporocyst, though I was able in this case to observe
the formation of a gastrula. The germs at first were
spherical, they then become oval, and afterwards they
elongate still more, whilst one end becomes narrower than
the other. The narrower end is partially constricted
from the remainder, and, becoming long and slender, forms
the tail of the cercaria, whilst the rest of the germ
becomes the body. A sucker appears at the anterior end,
and another of nearly equal size at the middle of the
ventral surface of the flattened body, whilst within a
digestive tract appears. This digestive tract is simply
forked, and presents no trace of the lateral branches so
characteristic of the adult.

The adult redia contains about a score of germs, but
these are in very different stages of development. There are
generally two or three nearly mature, the others in various
stages down to small spheres of cells. Close to the raised
ring surrounding the body of the cercaria there is a small
opening as in all redix, by means of which the
cercariae are destined to be liberated one by one as they
come to maturity.
But not all the rediae produce cercariae, for they some-
times produce other rediae, and these daughter-rediae then
give rise to cercariae. These latter, therefore, sometimes
only appear as the fourth generation in the snail, and in
one set of experiments I had reason to believe that no
cercariae appeared earlier. It will thus be seen that a single
embryo may give rise to more than a thousand cercariae.
In April of the [present year Leuckart published a
paper in the "Archiv fur Naturgeschichte," where he
described certain experiments on the development of the
liver-fluke. He believed that Limnaeus pereger was the
intermediate host, and had succeeded in infecting this
species, though he had failed to rear the redia beyond the
stage in which the contents were forming into spores. He
had, however, obtained a number of L. tru/icatirfus from a
friend, and had found in them three different sorts of rediae.
One of these contained tail-less distome larvae, and notwith-

standing that the characters of the redia were very
different from those reared from the embryo of the liver-
fluke, he believed the conjecture that this was really the
larva of the liver-fluke to be entirely justified until further
results were obtained. The second form he considered
might possibly be related to the liver-fluke, but the pro-
bability was far less than in the case of the tailless form.
In his description of the third form I at once recognised
the cercaria I had already found and suggested as the
larva of the liver-fluke. Leuckart, however, did not con-
sider that there could be any connection, because he
failed to detect any spines on the surface of the body
such as we should expect, and on account of the lobed
lateral organs, which he thought might be the vitellaria of
the adult.
I wrote a report of my own results as described above,
giving them, however, in greater detail, for the October
number of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.
This report was sent to the printer on the 1st of Septem-
ber, and a fortnight later received a revision which was
merely verbal.

Generally the Tuatara lives on the right side and the
'etrel on the left. Mr. Reischek says he sometimes
found two Petrels inhabiting their side of the chamber
ut never two Tuataras together.
He is certain that the Tuataras in most cases excavate
the holes as he watched them doing it, and moreover
found them in holes only half finished without any birds
with them. But there is no doubt that in some instances
the Tuataras also inhabit holes dug out by the Petrels.
Mr. Reischek likewise gives us some interesting facts
about the Tuataras' habits.
During the daytime these lizards are seldom met with
outside their holes, and never far from the entrances,
iut as soon as the sun has set, the Tuatara leaves its hole
to seek its food, which consists of worms, beetles, etc.
It also feeds on the remnants of fishes and crustaceans
brought by the Petrel into the chambjr. During the
night, a peculiar croaking sound is heard emanating from
these lizards, not unlike the grunting of a pig when it is
tormented. This is the best time to catch the Tuataras.

eggs in February, as in January he found in one of them
eight fully developed eggs, and about the same time
obtained a young one only eight inches long including
the tail.
So little has been hitherto recorded concerning the
habits of the Tuatara in a state of Nature that these facts
ascertained by Mr. Reischek and communicated by
Professor von Haast to the New Zetland Institute must
be allowed to be of great interest. Although the Tuatara
has not unfrequently been brought alive to this country,
and there are at the present time two examples of it living
in the Zoological Society's Collection, this reptile is
already quite extinct upon the mainland of New Zealand
and exists only in some of the more remote islets which
border its northern shores.
THE COMET
I SEND a few sketches and a brief account of the
!¦* comet Cruls. I found the comet at nh. a.m.
September 22, by sweeping the sky near the sun with the
lo-inch refractor of the Observatory of Palermo. It was
nut an easy object to find; it seems but a point with a
surrounding nebulosity, and a trace of tail directed to the
south-west.
On the following morning the comet had the form
(observed by Prof. Zona and myself) of Fig. 1, and preserved it until September 27; the tail was very splendid, inclined 500 to the horizon (that is to say, nearly parallel to the equator), a little convex to the south; the visible

io°; the breadth at the top was 40', and then i° 18'.
The nucleus was round and very brilliant, with a
yellowish light.
The spectrum was formed of the linear continuous
spectrum of the nucleus, traversed by a large and strong
line, that of sodium (D); by enlarging the slit of the
spectroscope, I saw a globular, monochromatic image of
the nucleus and coma. Besides the line of sodium, many
others were present, but my spectroscope not having a

in the red, a line in the yellow near and after D, two others
in the green, and an enlargement of the continuous
spectrum of the nucleus in green and blue.
From the form of Fig. 1, the comet passed to that of
Fig. 2 till October 1. The tail was more curved and
diverging, inclined to the horizon a little more than 45°;
the length was near 15°, the breadth at the top 1" 48'; *
south edge was very much stronger and brighter than the
north edge; an obscure streak seems to divide the comet
through the whole length. The nucleus was less luminous;

spondingly in the spectrum the sodium line was very
reduced and little luminous; but the usual three bands of
the hydrocarbonsyellow, green, and bluewere very
conspicuous.
From October 1 to the present time the comet ap-
proached the form of Fig. 3, which I observed this morn-
ing; around the nucleus and very excentrically to the
north, it is a faint envelope; at the top of the south edge
a sort of horn issued; the north extremity is i° distant
from a Hydrse. The length of the tail is iy", the breadth 2° 48'.
The nucleus is much diminished and little luminous,
and the colour of the comet almost white.
Besides the linear spectrum of the nucleus, the three
bands of hydrocarbons extend 5' round the nucleus.
The spectrum of the tail is continuous, and visible to
the end.
It is remarkable that the changes of the spectrum (ac-
cording to Dr. Hasselber's experiments) enabled me to
predict that the comet had passed the perihelion before
the orbit was calculated.

pentine, wax, and the ashes of burnt paper. Over this was
placed an iron frame, in which the clay types were set up until
it was full. The whole was then sufficiently heated to melt the
wax facing. An iron plate was placed above the types, making
them perfectly level, the wax being just soft enough to allow the
types to sink into it to the proper depth. This being done it

the principle of the printing press of Europe, alihough western

obtain a level surface without this device. Perhaps the need of
capital to lay in a stock of types, the want of a good type-metal

find an instance of how a deity is raised in rank for presumed
public services. The military governor of Urumlsi prays the
Emperor to confer a tablet on the deities of a mountain in his
district, in recognition of various acts of supernatural interposi-
tion. In this mountain there is a large lake of unfathomable
depth, upon the waters of -which the inhabitants of the whole
surrounding country rely for the irrigation of their lands. Of
recent years, however, it appears the springs had shown signs of
exhaustion, and much anxiety has been felt on this account.
Last year a temple, dedicated to the divinities of the mountain,
was erected, and scarcely had it been completed when the water
in the lake rose more than a hundred feet, and has ever since
afforded an unfailing supply of water. The assistance of these
deities has been invoked with unvarying success on many occa-
sions when locusts threatened to devastate the country, or when
snow was urgently needed for the protection of the crops. The

the pressure, a drop of a very deep indigo-blue liquid remained
in the end of the tube. The gas above this liquid was colourless,
but as the last traces of liquid evaporated, the gas was seen to
have a blue colour (Compt. rend. xciv. 1249).
It is well known that sulphuretted hydrogen produces little or
no precipitate in an aqueous solution of arsenious oxide : accord-
ing to the experiments of Messrs. H. Schulze (Journal fur
pract. Chemie, 2. xxv. 431), such a liquid contains a colloidal
form of arsenious sulphide. This colloid may be completely
separated from dissolved arsenious oxide by prolonged dialysis;
the solution, if dilute, is scarcely changed by long-continued
boiling; the presence of free acids or of such soluble salts as
chloride of potassium, iron, or chromium induces a change of
the colloidal into an insoluble form of arsenious sulphide.
By strongly compressing phosphoretted hydrogen in presence
of water, and then suddenly decreasing the pressure, M. Cailletet
has obtained a crystalline hydrate of this compound, the exist-
ence of which is conditioned by the temperature and pressure;

SCIENTIFIC WORTHIES
XX.James Prescott Joule
JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE was born at Salford on
Christmas-Eve of the year 1818. His father and
his grandfather before him were brewers, and the busi-
ness, in due course, descended to Mr. Joule and his elder
brother, and by them was carried on with success till it
was sold in 1854. Mr. Joule's grandfather came from
Elton, in Derbyshire, settled near Manchester, where he
founded the business, and died at the age of fifty-four in
1799. His father, one of a numerous family, married a
daughter of John Prescott of Wigan. They had five
children, of whom James Prescott Joule was the second,
and of whom three were sonsBenjamin, the eldest, James,
and John, and two daughtersAlice and Mary. Mr.
Joule's mother died in 1836 at the age of forty-eight; and
his father, who was an invalid for many years before his
death, died at the age of seventy-four in the year 1858.
Young Joule was a delicate child, and was not sent to
school. His early education was commenced by his
mother's half-sister, and was carried on at his father's

house, Broomhill, Pendlebury, by tutors, till he was about
fifteen years of age. At fifteen he commenced working in
the brewery, which, as his father's health declined, fell
entirely into the hands of his brother Benjamin and
himself.
Mr. Joule obtained his first instruction in physical
science from Dalton, to whom his father sent the two
brothers to learn chemistry. Dalton, one of the most
distinguished chemists of any age or country, was then
president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical
Society, and lived and received pupils in the rooms of the
Society's House. Many of his most important memoirs
were communicated to the Society, whose Transactions
are likewise enriched by"a large number of communi-
cations from his distinguished pupil. Dalton's instruc-
tion to the two young men commenced with arithmetic,
algebra, and geometry. He then taught them natural
philosophy out of Cavallo's text-book, and afterwards,
but only for a short time before his health gave way in
1837, chemistry from his own "New System of Che-
mical Philosophy." "Profound, patient, intuitive," his
teaching must have had great influence on his pupils.
We find Mr. Joule early at work on the molecular consti-
tution of gases, following in the footsteps of his illustrious
master, whose own investigations on the constitution of
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
mixed gases, and on the behaviour of vapours and gases
under heat, were among the most important of his day,
and whose brilliant discovery of the Atomic Theory
revolutionised the science of Chemistry and placed him
at the head of the philosophical chemists of Europe.
Under Dalton, Mr. Joule first became acquainted with
physical apparatus; and the interest excited in his
mind very soon began to produce fruit. Almost imme-
diately he commenced experimenting on his own account.
Obtaining a room in his father's house for the purpose,
he began by constructing a cylinder electric machine in a
very primitive way. A glass tube served for the cylinder;

a poker hung up by silk threads, as in the very oldest
forms of electric machine, was the prime conductor;
and for a Leyden jar he went back to the old historical
jar of Cunxus, and used a bottle half filled with water,
standing in an outer vessel, which contained water also.
Enlarging his stock of apparatus, chiefly by the work
of his own hands, he soon entered the ranks as an
investigator, and original papers followed each other in

as unit quantity of electricity, the quantity required to
decompose nine grains of water, 9 being the atomic weight
of water, according to the chemical nomenclature then
in use.
He had already made and described very important
improvements in the construction of galvanometers, and
he graduated his tangent galvanometer to correspond
with the system of electric measurement he had adopted.
The electric currents used in his experiments were thence-
forth measured on the new system; and the numbers
given in Joule's papers from 1840 downwards are
easily reducible to the modern absolute system of
electric measurements, in the construction and general
introduction of which he himself took so prominent
a part. It was in 1840, also, that after experiment-
ing on improvements in voltaic apparatus, he turned
his attention to " the heat evolved by metallic conductors
of electricity, and in the cells of a battery during electro-
lysis." In this paper and those following it in 1841 and
1842, he laid the foundation of a nev province in physical
scienceelectric and chemical thermodynamicsthen

totally unknown, but now wonderfully familiar even to
the roughest common-sense practical electrician. With
regard to the heat evolved by a metallic conductor carry-
ing an electric current, he established what was already supposed to be the law, namely, that "the quantity of
heat evolved by it [in a given time] is always proportional
to the resistance which it presents, whatever may be the
length, thickness, shape, or kind of the metallic con-
ductor," while he obtained the law, then unknown, that
the heat evolved is proportional to the square of the
quantity of electricity passing in a given time. Corre-
sponding laws were established for the heat evolved by
the current passing in the electrolytic cell, and likewise
for the heat developed in the cells of the battery itself.
In the year 1840 he was already speculating on the
transformation of chemical energy into heat. In the
paper last referred to and in a short abstract in the Pro-
ceedings of the Royal Society, December, 1840, he points
out that the heat generated in a wire conveying a current
ot electricity is a part of the heat of chemical combina-
tion of the materials used in the voltaic cell, and that
the remainder, not the whole heat of combination, is
evolved within the cell in which the chemical action takes
place. In papers given in 1841 and 1842, he pushes
his investigations farther, and shows that the sum of
the heat produced in all parts of the circuit during
          Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
voltaic action is proportional to the chemical action
that goes on in the voltaic pile, and again, that the quan-
tities of heat which are evolved by the combustion of
equivalents of bodies are proportional to the intensities
of their affinities for oxygen. Having proceeded thus
far, he carried on the same train of reasoning and experi-
ment till he was able to announce, in January, 1843,
that the magneto-electric machine enables us to convert
mechanical power into heat. Most of his spare time in
the early part of the year 1843 was devoted to making
experiments necessary for the discovery of the laws of
the development of heat by magneto-electricity, and for
the definite determination of the mechanical value of heat.
At the meeting of the British Association at Cork, on
August 21, 1843, he read his paper "On the Calorific
Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and on the Mechanical
Value of Heat." The paper gives an account cl .'
admirable series of experiments, proving that ki it
generated (not merely transferred from some -ru.-
by the magneto-electric machine. The investor :-

rate thermometers; and whilst Regnault was doing the
same thing in France Mr. Joule produced, with the
assistance of Mr. Dancer, instrument maker, of Man-
chester, the first English thermometers possessing such
accuracy as the mercury-in-glass thermometer is capable
of. Some of them were forwarded to Prof. Graham and
to Prof. Lyon Playfair: and the production of these in-
struments was in itself a most important contribution to
scientific equipment.
As the direct experiment of friction of a fluid is dependent
on no hypothesis, andappears to be wholly unexceptionable,
it was used by Mr. Joule repeatedly in modified forms.
The stirring of mercury, of oil, and of water with a
paddle, which was turned by a falling weight, was com-
pared, and solid friction, the friction of iron on iron under
mercury, was tried; but the simple stirring of water
seemed preferable to any, and was employed in all his
later determinations.
In 1847 Mr. Joule was married to Amelia, daughter of
Mr. John Grimes, Comptroller of Customs, Liverpool.
His wife died early (1854), leaving him one son and one

daughter.
The meeting of the British Association at Oxford in
this year, proved an interesting and important one.
Here Joule read a fresh paper "On the Mechanical
Equivalent of Heat." Of this meeting Sir William
Thomson writes as follows to the author of this notice:
"I made Joule's acquaintance at the Oxford meeting,
and it quickly ripened into a life-long friendship.
"I heard his paper read in the section, and felt strongly
impelled at first to rise and say that it must be wrong
because the true mechanical value of heat given, suppose
in warm water, must, for small differences of temperaturej
be proportional to the square of its quantity. I knew
from Carnot that this must be true (and it is true; only
now I call it 'motivity,' to avoid clashing with Joule's
'mechanical value.') But as I listened on and on, I
saw that (though Carnot had vitally important truth,
not to be abandoned) Joule had certainly a great truth
and a great discovery, and a most important measure-
ment to bring forward. So instead of rising with my
objection to the meeting I waited till it was over, and
said my say to Joule himself, at the end of the meeting.
This made my first introduction to him. After that I
had a long talk over the whole matter at one of the con-
versaziones of the Association, and we became fast

friends from thenceforward. However, he did not tell
me he was to be married in a week or so; but about a
fortnight later I was walking down from Chamounix to
commence the tour of Mont Blanc, and whom should I
meet walking up but Joule, with a long thermometer in
his hand, and a carriage with a lady in it not far off. He
told me he had been married since we had parted at
Oxford! and he was going to try for elevation of tempera-
ture in waterfalls. We trysted to meet a few days later
at Martigny, and look at the Cascade de Sallanches, to
see if it might answer. We found it too much broken
into spray. His young wife, as long as she lived, took
complete interest in his scientific work, and bcth she and
he showed me the greatest kindness during my visits to
them in Manchester, for our experiments on the thermal
effects of fluid in motion, which we commenced a few
years later."
"Joule's paper at the Oxford meeting mad~ a great
sensation. Faraday was there and was much struck with
it, but did not enter fully into the new views. It was
many years after that before any of the scientific chiefs

menters, and for the accuracy, so far as was required for
the purpose in hand, of his own experiments. His deter-
mination of the specific heat of air, pressure constant, and
the specific heat of air, volume constant, furnished the data
necessary for making Laplace's theoretical velocity agree
with the velocity of sound experimentally determined. On
the other hand, he was able to account for most puzzling
discrepancies which appeared in attempted direct deter-
minations of the differences between the two specific heats
by careful experimenters. He pointed out that in experi-
ments in which air wa= allowed to rush violently or explode
into a vacuum, there was a source of loss of energy that
no one had taken account of, namely, in the sound pro-
duced by the explosion. Hence in the most careful
experiments where the vacuum was made as perfect as
possible, and the explosion correspondingly the more
violent, the results were actually the worst. With his
explanations the theory of the subject was rendered
quite complete.
Space fails, or I should mention in detail Mr.
Joule's experiments on magnetism and electro-magnets,

referred to at the commencement of this sketch. He dis-
covered the now celebrated change of dimensions produced
by the magnetisation of soft iron by the current. The
peculiar noise which accompanies the magnetisation of an
iron bar by the current, sometimes called the "magnetic
tick," was thus explained.
Mr. Joule's improvements in galvanometers have al-
ready been incidentally mentioned, and the construction
by him of accurate thermometers has been referred to.
It should never be forgotten that he first used small
enough needles in tangent galvanometers to practically
annul error from want of uniformity of the magnetic field.
Of other improvements and additions to philosophical
instruments may be mentioned a thermometer, unaffected
by radiation, for measuring the temperature of the atmo-
sphere, an improved barometer, a mercurial vacuum
pump, one of the very first of the species which is now
doing such valuable work not only in scientific labora-
tories, but in the manufacture of incandescent electric
lamps, and an apparatus for determining the earth's hori-
zontal magnetic force in absolute measure.
Here this imperfect sketch must close. My limits are
already passed. Mr. Joule has never been in any sense
a public man; and, of those who know his name as that
of the discoverer who has given the experimental basis
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
for the grandest generalisation in the whole of physical
science, very few have ever seen his face. Of his private
character this is scarcely the place to speak. Mr. Joule is
still amongst us. May he long be spared to work for
that cause to which he has given his life with heart-whole
devotion that has never been excelled.
In June, 1878, he received a letter from the Earl of
Beaconsfield announcing to him that Her Majesty the
Queen had been pleased to grant him a pension of 200/.
per annum. This recognition of his labours by his
country was a subject of much gratification to Mr. Joule.
Mr. Joule received the Gold Royal Medal of the Royal
Society in 1852, the Copley Gold Medal of the Royal
Society in 1870, and the Albert Medal of the Society of
Arts from the hands of the Prince of Wales in 1880.

in the near future, gas managers will have to consider the
market prices of these "residuals," as influencing the
mode of their manufacture, more carefully than they have
hitherto done. They must in fact recognise that they
are just as much makers of tar and ammonia as of coal-
gas, and whether the one or the other is to be worked for
must be governed by calculations depending upon the
relative prices of gas and tar.
Chapter II. deals mainly with the properties of coal-tar
and its constituents. A very complete list of these is
given, and special attention is paid to their physical cha-
racters whenever these have been ascertained. Benzene,
of course, is very fully described, even to an account of
the rival theories of Kekule', Claus, and Ladenburg as to
its constitution. We entirely endorse Dr. Lunge's recog-
nition of the enormous value of Kekuld's famous hypo-
thesis in the development of the history of the aromatic
derivatives; nevertheless the average tar distiller will, we
are afraid, be lost in wonder and amazement at the idea
of such fruitful consequences flowing from pictures of
hexagons and prisms. In other words the description on
p. 40 of the chemical constitution of the parent member
of the aromatic group is far too bald to be of the slightest

use to persons ignorant of the modern methods of repre-
senting constitution, and conveys no new information to
those who know anything of such matters.
Chapter III. treats of the applications of coal-tar with-
out distillation, such as its use for gas making, heating,
and for the preservation of building materials and its use
as an antiseptic, and in the manufacture of paints, var-
nishes, &c. Chapter IV. deals with the methods of dis-
tilling coal-tar, such as its distillation by steam and by
fire. This and the next chapter (Chapter V.), on pitch,
are extremely well illustrated by cuts and plates showing
the best methods of constructing stills and condensing
apparatus, mode of treating the gases and the different
fractions, and a series of most valuable figures and tables
are givtn of the results obtained in various works in
England and on the Continent from different tars.
Chapters VI. and VII. treat of anthracene and creosote
oil, and considerable attention is given to the important
question of the quantitative determination of anthracene
and of the so-called coal-tar acids. Chapter VIII. is
concerned with phenol or carbolic acid and naphthalene,

assistance of Mr. Hodges and Mr. Percy Smith, the following
details were obtained. The tail extended for quite 15° in length,
and about 5° in width at its widest part, being slightly curved
with the convexity downwards. The lower edge of the tail was very sharp, but the upper edge was gradually shaded off. The
nucleus was considerably lengthened out in the direction of the
tail to an extent of quite three times its width. Its estimated
length was 10".
On examination with the spectroscope, with the nucleus
across the slit, there appeared a narrow continuous spectrum

I INCLOSE a drawing made this morning after a prolonged
examination (with a binocular) of the end of the comet's tail.
Should you think the peculiar features which I have endeavoured
to portray of sufficient interest to reproduce, the drawing is at
your service. It is difficult to indicate truly features of this
kind without exaggeration, if they are to catch the eye at all;
but I am sure the exaggeration is very slight. The tail would
seem to be about to ei.d rather suddenly and with a broad end,
when, from near the middle, shoots out, at a slight inclination to
the general direction of the tail, a cleanly-shaded wisp. And as
though this were due to a kind of cleft or parting, there is a cor-
responding broader sweeping-aside of the tail-end on the other
side. One is at once reminded of the backward fraying of the
broad side of a large feather. The effect is a decided enlarge-
ment of the end of the tail on one side, and a. well-detar:
streamer shooting out at a slight inclination towards tie odr
The direction of the latter is such as to pass quite clear of the head, which is not a ncces-ary consequence of its inrlimn -
because of the curve which characterises the sharply-defined southern edge of the whole tail.
It is surely unusual for such decided features to prases theo-
selver at the very end of a comet's tail.
As a whole, the comet seems to have changed wonderfully little during the three weeks since I first saw it. Its change of place, also, is so moderate that, at this rate, there s«ms ao
reason why we should not see it for months yet. What rf

Collingwood, October 23
For several mornings past we have had fine views of the
comet, first seen in England by Mr. A. Common. I inclose a sketch taken this morning, as accurate as I could make it with materials at hand.
It is chiefly remarkable (1) for the crescentic end of tb* ni
the lower or eastern horn being loi ger than the oiher;(2)fcr
the distinctness of the shadow in the space beyond the tail, shadow obviously projected by the comet. Such a shadow I
have never seen in any of the comets which have been under my observation during the last fifty years, nor do I recollect to have
The Comet from Cannes, October 21, between 5 and 6 a.m.

I presume that the propinquity oi this comet to the sun is the reason why the shadow is unusually visible in contrast to the
luminosity around it; but probably the peculiar clearness of oa
atmesphere renders the phenomenon clearer than it may be in England. In any case the appearance is interesting in relatic-

was clearly visible was such, that if the head had been placed on
Sirius, the tail would have reached to Orion's belt. 2. The
lower edge of the tail was compara'ively sharp and brightly
defined, while there was 1 o well-defined upper edge. 3. At
first sight the tail ended, fairly abruptly, in a short fork. But
on glancing to one side, so as to allow the image to fall on a
more sensitive part of the retina, one became aware that these
two forks were continued in a very faint and hazy manner as far
again as the length of the comet first noticed (mentioned and
measured in (1.)) Or, more strictly, one became aware of a
black rift in the sky behind the comet, in its direction, above
and below which the sky was faintly luminous. One may fay
that at first sight the comet ended like a house-manin's, on more
careful observation like a swallow's, tail. The tola! length of
the comet thus seen was enormous; and the appearance sug-

same difficulties as Sir George Airy, I propose w ith your per-
mission to offer a few explanations.
Sir G. Airy summarises his remarks under six heads, but I
think two would have sufficed, viz. that the bridge was too big
to please Sir George, and that the engineers were presumably
incompetent. As to size, for example, Sir George considers the
fact of the cantilever being "longer than the Cathedral by 175
feet is in itself enough to excite some fear," and even to "justify
great alarm." But when I look for some justification for this
bold statement I find that Sir George doe; not advance any
reason whatever, nor make use in any way of his high mathe-
matical attainments, but simply shifts the responsibility for this
alarm on to the shoulders of the "citizens of London," asking-,
"would they feel themselves in perfect security? I think not;
and I claim the same privilege of entertaining the sense of
insecurity for the proposed Forth Bridge."
If Sir George had alleged that the stresses on the cantilever
could not be calculated, or that the strength of the steel ties and
struts could not be predicted, or that the cantilever could not be
erected, I might have replied by publishing diagrams of stresses,
results of experiments, and the names of the firms who have
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:13 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
ter.dered for the work. I cannot, however, answer an argument
based upon the supposed fears of the "citizens of London."
To prove that Sir George's criticisms imply a charge of in-
competency on the part of the engineers, I need only point cut
that in one sentence he remarks that "experienced engineers
must have known instances in which buildings have failed from
want of consideration of buckling," and in another, that "there
appears to be a fear of its occurrence in various parts of the
bracket," when "the bridge will be ruined." Sir George's con-
clusions on this head are, however, as he fairly enough states,
"made in the total absence of experiment or explanation," and
in ignorance whether "a theory of buckling finds place in any
of the books which treat of engineering." To assume, how-
ever, that an engineer is similarly ignorant, clearly amounts to
a grave charge of incompetency. Again, how incompetent
must the engineer be who required to be informed that
the "horizontal action of the wind on the great projecting
brackets depends not simply on the wind's pressure, but also
on its leverage," or who neglected to provide for the conse-
quent stresses. Yet Sir George does not hesitate to say. in
reference to this, that "in the proposed Forth bridge there is a
risk of danger of the most serious kind, which may perhaps
surpass all other dangers."
As Sir George in the whole of his letter does not prcduce a
single figure or fact in support of his very serious charges, I
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
must, injustice to Mr. Fowler and myself, explain that it was
from no want of data. At Sir George's request hi was fur-
nished with every necessary detail for ascertaining the maximum
stress on each member, and the factor of safety. I stated in
the parer referred to by Sir George at the commencement of his
letter, that under the combined action of an impossible rolling
load of 3400 tons upon one span, and a hurricane of 56 lbs. per
square foot, the maximum stress upon the steel would in no case
exceed 74 tons per square inch. Any useful criticism must be
directed to prove that such load is not enough or that such stress
is too great. Nothing can be decided by appeals to the citizens
of London.
Sir George's remarks about what he terms "buckling," and
the "total absence of experiment," I can hardly reconcile with
his having read my paper, because I have there devoted six
pages to the question of long struts, and have given the results
of the most recent experiments on flexure by myself and others.
When he asks whether a tubular strut 340 feet long would be
safe against buckling, he has evidently overlooked the twenty
years' existence of the Saltash Bridge, which has a tubular
arched iron strut 455 feet long, subject to higher stresses than

bility of the bridge when erected would equal that of the best
existing structures of that class.
The paper referred to contains six points of objection, which
are treated in a general way without attempting a scientific
criticism. 'Ihis is to be regretted considering the import-
ance of the subject. I take each point in succession. With
regard to
I. I cannot see an objection to the novelty of a system, if, as
n this case, the conditions are unprecedented, and if the author
of the paper himself is compelled to recommend a system of
striking novelty.
II. What, may be asked, constitutes the enormity of magni-
tude of a structural part? Is it the excessive proportion of
strain in it arising from its own weight to that arising from other
weights and forces? If so, it will be found that this proportion
may here be still very small, although it may not be ignored, as
sometimes is done.
III. The experimental knowledge hitherto derived from struc-
tures with rising degrees of magnitude has not upset the theories
used in the calculations of strength. It cannot be asserted that
the top flange of a common rolled beam, being a strut, we assume
       Generated for acobblah (University of Michigan) on 2013-04-11 08:13 GMT / http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015038818525
twenty times as long as it is wide, would be under a test load in
a safer position against buckling than the top flange of the Ohio
girder bridge, which is 510 feet long and 20 feet wide, or the
bottom flange of the Forth Bridge, which is 675 feet long and
from 32 to 120 feet wide.
Jf/. We constantly rely on the strength of long .strut1: ; they
exist in all girders, and many of them are of the same import-
ance for the strength of the girders as the links for the strength
of a chain. The theory of their strength, imperfect as it is, is
applicable to all with a fair amount of truth, and there is no
reason why it should not be applied equally to the struts in the
Forth Bridge.
V. Assuming that the dangers from wind-pressure during the
erection do not concern us here, it would be interesting to hear
from the author which parts of the < rccted bridge would pro-
bably give way first, and whether this would take place by
crushing, shearing, twisting, or pulling actions. The leverage
offered to wind by the long brackets would come into question
only when the pressure is different on the two sides of a pier.
The difference would produce a twisting action, which would exist in the central pier, but which could be obviated in the two
side piers. The resisting leverage of the central pier is 270 feet,
or about two-thirds of the acting leverage. Approximately the
same proportion obtains with regard to the stability against tilt-
ing under uniform wind-pressure, while in the case of the Tay
Bridge the proportion was less than one-third.

VI. It is highly improbable that Mr. Baker should not have
calculated his struts; in his book on the strength of beams,
columns, and arches, he gives a very intelligible deduction of the
theory of long struts, which, although elementary and not so
elegant as that by the author, seems original. I have found
deductions of that kind in most English text books, while in
books of foreign origin generally the equation of the line of
flexure is taken as the starting point. Its approximate fonn

NATURE
Prof. Barrett's, that the effect of longitudinally magnetising a
bar of iron, or of increasing its magnetisation, is to increase its
dimensions longitudinally and to diminish them laterally, so that
the volume remains constant; and on the other hand, from Sir
William Thomson's investigations, that the effect of increase of
longitudinal dimensions in an iron bar is to increase, and of
increase of transverse dimensions to diminish its longitudinal
magnetisation.
This analogy holds al-o with reference to steel and nickel. In
the case of bars of these metals, we found their longitudinal
magnetisation to be diminished by the application of longitudinal
pull, and Prof. Barrett has found that bars of the same metals
undergo a shortening when their longitudinal magnetisation is
increased.
In the case of cobalt, however, the results do not agree. The
results for cobalt, given in Sir W. Thomson's paper, are some-
what anomalous, but they refer only to the effect of stress on
magnetism in a bar which had been previously magnetised and
then placed while being experimented on, under the influence of
the earth's vertical force The results were therefore complicated
by the effects of the stress on the residual magnet ism. So far as

these results go they bear out to some extent those found by
Prof. Barrett, but further experiments, the results of which have
not yet been published, prove that the effects of stress are the
same as for nickel. This is the case at least for all but low mag-
netising forces.
The behaviour of cobalt and nickel throughout a wide range
of magnetising forces, and under the influence of both transverse
and longitudinal stress, will, it is hoped, be fully investigated in
a continuation of Sir William Thomson's experiments, begun
some time ago, and temporarily interrupted by other, and for
the time being, more pressing work, but now about to be
resumed.
I may mention that my brother and myself pointed out in
Naturf, vol. xviii. p. 329, the applicability of a modification of
Edison's Tasimeter to the measurement of the changes of dimen-
sions produced in a body by magnetisation. We still think that
this is perhaps the most simple method, and we have found it
very sensitive for qualitative results. In our trials of it we have
experienced some difficulty in obtaining a carbon button which
would return after having been subjected to stress to the same
resistance as before. The experiments of Prof. Mendenhall,
however, show that the kind of carbon used by Edison in his
Tasimeter possesses this property in perfection; and we hope
soon by the use of this carbon to obtain quantitative results.

'I 'HE first earthquake that I ever felt took place about
¦* 2 a.m. on the night of April 10, 1876. On this night,
which was soon after my arrival in Yedo, I had been in-

partially furnished dwelling in a strange land, and then
in the dead of night to be wakened by a swinging motion
of the bedstead, a rattling of windows, creaking of timbers,
and flapping of pictures was more than bewildering.
For some time after the motion had died away, which
motion had several maxima and minima, some little rings
upon the bedstead which had been caused to swing, kept
up a gentle clicking, and a night light upon a basin of oil
as it swayed from side to side cast long flickering shadows

across the room. The general behaviour of things was
ghostly, and it was some time before I could assure
myself that whit I had experienced was an earthquake.
Next morning, however, my doubts were dissipated by
my neighbours making jocular inquiries about the nature of
my experiences. Earthquake conversation, I may remark,
is often used in Yedo to fill up the gaps in conversation,
which in England are usually stopped by queries and
truisms about the weather. This was my first earthquake.
Palmieri's instrument indicated that its direction was
about E.S.E. to W.N.W., and its force was 6 degrees.
By 6 degrees is meant that the shaking caused some
mercury contained in a glass tube to wash up and down
until a little string attached to an iron float on its surface
had turned a pully and a pointer through 6°. By observing
the tables of these indications it is seen that a very gentle
shaking of long duration may get up a violent oscillation
in the mercury and so indicate a shock of a great number
of degrees, whilst a violent sharp shock, which might knock
over a chimney, may possibly only indicate a few degrees.
Since my first earthquake I have had the opportunity
during the last six years of studying rather more than
400 other shakings. One of these shook d jwn chimneys,
unroofed houses, twisted gravestones, and by its action
generally entitled itself to be called destructive and alarm-

ing. The effect that this earthquake produced upon the
nerves of many people was quite as great as that which
might be produced upon children with an imaginary ghost.
As residents in Japan are so often alarmed by earthquakes
it is only natural that they should be led to study these
phenomena. Amongst the first instruments which were
employed for their investigation were, as might be antici-
pated, small columns, bowls of liquid, and other con-
trivances, which are found described in books and papers
treating of observational seismology.
Columns which have been made of various shapes
and various materials have been found unsatisfactory,
because it is seldom (even when a house may be sway-
ing violently), if they are on a stone platform firmly
fixed to the ground that they are overturned. When
it happens that they are overturned, if there were
several columns side by side you would usually find
them lying pointing like the arms of a star-fish in different
directions. If an earthquake was a sharp blow, no doubt
the columns would fall in the direction of the shock and
also towards the point from which the shock came.

1. That the earthquakes in Tokio usually commence
gently, the motion is irregular, both as regards space and
time, increasing and decreasing. Finally it dies away as
it commenced.
- There are usually from two to three vibrations per
second. Occasionally there may be six or eight.
3- The maximum amplitude of an earth particle is sel-
dom over one millimetre, although buildings may swing
through several inches. When the amplitude is four or
five millimetres, and the motion rapid, the shock may be
dangerous.
'04. During a given sho;k the direction of motion may
Uiange, apparently showing the presence of normal and
transverse vibrations.
5. The motion of the ground inwards towards the
origin of the disturbance has in certain cases been much
greater than the motion outwards. In this respect the
diagram obtained from an actual earthquake closely re-
sembles the diagram obtained when we explode a charge
of dynamite in a bore hole.
6. The velocity, and with it the acceleration for the in-

ward motion, is usually much greater than it is for the
outward motion.
In addition to these characters, earthquake motion has
others which are more complex, and are now forming a
subject of examinaiion. Thus, for instance, experiment
apparently indicates that two neighbouring points of
ground (say at the distance of two feet from each other)
do not synchronise in their motion. This would indicate
that a buiMing, although it may be small, may not be

moved back and forth as a whole, but may suffer con-
siderable racking.
The intervals in time between the actual earthquakes,
which on the average occur from six to ten times per
month, have been filled up with experiments upon artifici-
ally produced earthquakes, made by exploding charges of
dynamite and gunpowder in bore holes. These experi-
ments, in which the vibrations of the ground produced by
the explosions have been simultaneously written down at
a number of different stations, have perhaps been more
instructive than the actual earthquakes. They have been
to seismology what laboratory experiments on magnetism
have been to the student of the magnetic phenomena of the
earth. Not only have results similar to those which have

been enumerated for actual earthquakes been obtained,
but also many others. Thus it is found that in the allu-
vium of the Tokio plain a surface wave' is produced, as
might be inferred from the fact that the observation of the
horizontal and vertical components of the motion of the
ground, do not enable us to deduce angles of emergence
tor the shock and the depth of its origin. Normal and
transversal vibrations have been clearly separated. The
effect produced by inequalities in the surface of the ground
in cutting off the propagation of vibrations have been
studied. Small hills appear to produce but a slight

effect, whilst cuttings (like a deep pond) are more or less
effective in interrupting a disturbance.
By the comparison of a number of diagrams of earth
vibrations, taken simultaneously at different stations, it
has been an easy matter to investigate the relative ampli-
tudes of different vibrations. Near to the origin of a dis-

the rise and fall of tides. Sudden alterations in baro-
metrical pressure may possibly produce earthquakes of
large amplitude and slow period, similar to those here
referred to, which hitherto have been passed by unnoticed.
The following are examples of the various records which
have been referred to.
The diagram (Fig. 5) is a tracing from a photograph of
the east and west component of the earthquake of March
11, 1882, as recorded in Tokio. The regularly marked
intervals represent seconds of time. For about 12 seconds
before the shock there was a rapid tremulous motion. It
will be observed that the westward motion of the shock
is less in amplitude, and has been performed more slowly
than the eastward motion. The origin of the shock was
to the S.S.E. After the shock, which had a maximum
amplitude of about 3'5 mm., the motion died out irregu-
larly. Altogether the earthquake lasted about ii minutes.
Prof. Ewing, who recorded this same disturbance at a
station about a mile distant, recorded a maximum motion
of 6 mm., and the duration of the disturbance could be
traced over a period of about 44 minutes.

Fig. 6 represents the normal motion of the ground pro-
duced by exploding about 2 lbs. of dynamite in a bore
hole about 8 feet deep. The distance at which the seis-
mograph was placed from the explosion was 100 feet.
The intervals represent half seconds of time. The up-
ward movement indicates motion inwards towards the
origin of the disturbance.
The three diagrams (Figs. 7, 8, 9) are diagrams of
actual earthquake motion, as drawn by a pendulum seis-
mograph on stationary smoked glass plates.

about -9 mm.

Here the motion has been in at least two directions,

Fig. 9 an earthquake at Tokio, 4.15.0 p.m., March 8,
1882. Here there has been motion in several directions.
The maximum amplitude is about 2'2 mm.
Another class of seismic experiments which, although
they are by no means sufficiently complete have yielded
good results, are those in which time observations have
formed the important features. One result of these ex-

periments, in addition to telling us the side and locality
from which earthquakes have come, has been to show
that the direction in which the ground has vibrated has
sometimes been at right angles to the direction in which
the disturbance was being propagated. The chief results,
however, have been with regard to the velocity of propa-
gation. These may be epitomised as follows :
1. Different earthquakes, although they have travelled
across the same district, have done so with different
velocities.
2. The greater the initial disturbance the greater the
velocity of propagation.
3. The same disturbance is propagated with a decreas-
ing velocity.
These results it may be remarked have received direct
confirmation, both for normal and transverse motions, in
experiments made by exploding charges of dynamite.
Another point which has received considerable atten-
tion has been the production of what are apparently earth
currents at the time of an artificial disturbance.

NA TURE
In conclusion I must draw attention to the excellent
opportunities which many of those residing in Britain
have for the observation of artificially produced earth
tremors. By these I mean the vibrations which are pro-
duced by our railway trains, our carriages, explosions at
mines and quarries, steam hammers, the falling of balls
used in the breaking of castings, and other means. All of
these vibrations I can state with confidence are capable
of being graphically recorded, and the value of a series
of such records to the practical seismologist it is hardly
necessary to dilate upon.
Investigations of this description are the laboratory
work of the practical seismologist, and often lead to more
valuable results than those which are obtained from
actual earthquakes. Actual earthquakes are produced
by unknown causes, they come at unknown times, and
from unknown localities. With artificially produced
disturbances none of these difficulties have to be con-
tended with, the cause and the result are before us
simultaneously, and we are enabled to arrive at laws
which actual earthquakes would never yield to us.

Another point to which I should like to draw attention
is the study of earth movements in general. Hitherto we
have only devoted our attention to the sudden and violent
movements which we call earthquakes. In addition to
these we have in nature movements of less amplitude
called earth tremors. Inasmuch as we now know that
these are probably a universal phenomenon, and at the
same time are in every probability governed bylaws simpler
than those which govern earthquakes which are usually
due to a complexity of causes, it certainly devolves upon
us to establish the necessary means for their investigation.
From the little we have learnt about earth tremors it is
not unlikely that they maybe to our continents what tides
are to our oceans, phenomena which are regular and law
abiding, and not like the earthquakes, which may be
compared to the storms of the ocean.
In addition to these motions of small amplitude we
have many reasons for believing in the existence of
motions of our ground of great amplitude, but so slow in
period that hitherto they have been overlooked.
In order to complete the study of earth motions we
have to add to seismology the study of earth tremors and
what might be called earth pulsations.
As we have done so much for our skies, for our atmo-
sphere, and for our waters, we can surely do a little
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
towards the investigation of the movements of the earth
on which we live.
Although these latter remarks have no direct connec-
tion with the work which has been accomplished in
Japan, they are nevertheless an outcome of such work,
and if they tend in any way to draw attention to a much
neglected study, an object will have been attained greater
than any which could be hoped for by diffusing a know-
ledge of the labours of those who dwell at our Antipodes.

THE LATE PROFESSOR BALFOUR
THE meeting held last Saturday to establish a me-
morial to the late Prof. Balfour was very largely
attended by all grades in the University, and among non-
residents by Professors Huxley, H. J. S. Smith, A. W.
Williamson, W. K. Parker, Ray Lankester, H. N.
Moseley, and A. M. Marshall and Mr. George Griffith, of
Harrow. The president of the Royal Society would have
been present but for his recent accident. The speakers,
including most of those mentioned above, and Professors
Paget, Humphry, Newton, and Westcott, bore unanimous

ence to an allusion of Mr. Sedgwick, he said he should
always consider it to be one of the brightest episodes of
his career that, having found in Balfour a young man
capable of giving instruction, he had afforded him facili-
ties. The late Professor was not only an instructor but a
student, and no one ever remained so much a student."
Prof. Williamson proposed "That a committee be ap-
pointed to collect subscriptions and to draw up condi-
tions under which, with the sanction of the subscribers at a
future meeting, the fund shall be offered to the University."
Dr. Michael Foster proposed the following resolution :
"That the Committee be instructed(1) that the value
of the studentship be not less than 200/. a year; (2) that
while it is desirable that the studentship should be in
some way closely connected with this University, persons
other than members of this University shall be eligible
to it; (3) that it be not given away by competitive
examination; (4) that in framing regulations both for the
conduct of the student and the award of occasional
grants, the primary object of the fundnamely, the fur-
therance of original research, be closely adhered to." He

said he thought the above instructions to the Committee
did not need any defence. The object of the memorial
was not to keep Prof. Balfour's memory alive, for his
works would do that, but to connect his name with some
useful thing. The idea in fixing the value of the student-
ship at 200/ was that such a sum would be just sufficient
to attract men led by enthusiasm to turn their attention
to research, while it would be insufficient to induce
persons to accept it as a competency. He thought it
right not to restrict the studentship to members of the
University, for they desired to attract talent from all
parts of the country, while he considered that it was a
proper condition not to throw it open to a competitive
examination, for the studentship was not intended as a
reward for past work or an acknowledgment of merit,
but to encourage men of promise to undertake research.
An influential committee was appointed to collect sub-
scriptions and draw up detailed conditions under which,
after a future meeting of subscribers, the fund may be
offered to the University. Mr. J. W. Clark, M.A.,
1, Scroop Terrace, and Mr. A. Sedgwick, M.A., Trinity
College, Cambridge, were appointed secretaries of the
committee, the former to act as treasurer. The fund starts
well, with the munificent contribution of 3000/. from the
family of the late Prof. Balfour, and to 1000/. which had

biology; nearly 1000/. was subscribed in the room or

whose death was recorded in a recent number of
Nature, was a well-known member of the older genera-
tion of British botanists. I do not know the exact date
or place of his birth, but suppose it to have been in 1811.
In his early life he followed the profession of Notary
Public at Bristol, and apparently had a hard struggle to
support and educate numerous younger brothers and
sisters. He had a natural passion for botanical studies
which he cultivated to such good purpose as to obtain
the appointment of Lecturer on Botany and Vegetable
Physiology at the School of Medicine at Bristol. He
was no less ardent as an entomologist, and throughout
his life collected assiduously; some of his earliest papers
are on entomological subjects. His principal published
work has, however, always been botanical. Till he left

ancestor." . , .
Besides the "Enumeratio," Thwaites published subse-
quently a few papers on detailed points in Ceylon botany.
His tenure of office was associated with some of the
most important developments of the Ceylon planting
industry. In 1861 and subsequent years he took an
active part in the operations undertaken by the Govern-
ment of India, in concert with the Royal Gardens, Kew,
for the introduction of Cinchona into the East. From the
first the enterprise succeeded in Ceylon beyond expecta-
tion, and in 1869 the first ton of bark grown in the island
was sent to England for sale. In 1864 he began to urge
the cultivation of tea, and in 1868 a sample, manufac-
tured in Ceylon, was sent to this country. Cocoa was
similarly brought forward in 1867, and it now bids fair
to be one of the most important of Ceylon staples.
I iberian coffee was introduced from Kew in 1873. In
1876 the plants of Para, Ceara, and Central American
india-rubber plants, obtained for the Indian Government,
were sent from Kew, where they had been propagated,

to Dr. Thwaites' charge in Ceylon, which was made the
depot, for their subsequent distribution to India.
During the later years of his life Dr. Thwaites had
beeA in weakly health, and lived latterly a retired and
extremely abstemious life. But his singularly refined and
cultivated mind always gave him a position of distinction
in Ceylon society, and he enjoyed the esteem and per-
sonal friendship of successive governors. He became a
Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1854, and of the Royal
Society in 1865 ; and in 1878 the Crown conferred upon
him the Companionship of St. Michael and St. George, in
recognition of his long services. Two years afterwards he
retired, and took up his abode near Kandy, being unable
to persuade himself to leave the island where so much of his
life had been continuously spent. He died on September
11, and was followed to the grave on the following day by
a large assemblage and the members of the Peradeniya
Garden Staff, including the coolie labourers. ^

The Congress on Cable Protection may be said to have

The New Zealand University had been in operation since 1870,

degrees. This might appear a small result, but the object of
the University was to raise the standard of education, and this
had been done. The system of scholarships had been continued
wvii the University course, and a large portion of the funds had
I been spent in this way. For some time past the examiners had

in'the eyes of the cuter world, equal to those granted by the
London University. Owing to its charter, the New Zealand
University could not grant degrees for science, but there was
every prospect that the barrier would soon be removed, Dr.
Hector then referred to the disaffiliation of Wellington College,
which has been converted into a high school for secondary edu-

might get a University College.
A curious project in the way of recreation, by M. Joyeux, is
pnblished in La Nature. Suppose a large circular wooden
chamber, lit from above, but giving no view of outer objects
from within, and rotattd smoothly and rapidly on a vertical axis.
A person standing in it wculd have to bend his body towards the
centre, by reason of centrifugal force, and the more so the
further he might be from the centre and the higher the speed.
M. Joyeux supposes he would be subject to the illusion that the
floor was inclined upwards from his position to the centre; if he
had to place himself at an angle of 45°, the floor would seem
inclined at this angle, and a person standing in the corresponding
;lace on the Joppo.-ile side would seem horizontal, for he, too,
would have to make an-angle of 450. Only at the centre would
the floor seem horizontal ; and if a number of persons were in
the chamber, it is only there one would see them in their real
position?. A person walking round the ciicumference would

seem to be at the outside of the base of a cone, which
turned under him. To facilitate the position of persons,
M. Joyeux would make the floor, not horizontal, but inclining
upwards at a certain distance from the centre. M. Tissandier
does not feel ceitain that the illusions described would actually
occur, but regards the scheme as an attractive curiosity. The
apparatus is named a plagioscope.

rough water, in accordance with the principle he has laid down,
that whenever a liquid mass in motion acquires rapidly a free
surface, more or less, there is developed a growing quantity of
potential energy at the expense of the kinetic energy of the mass;
and reciprocally to a rapid diminution of free surface corresponds
always an increase of kinetic energy. Oil hinders the succes-
sive superposition of liquid layers, and so, the increase of the
kinetic energy of the liquid mass. Floating bodies of various
kinds (branches, sea-weed, ice-crystals, &c.) have a like action;
immediately after the gliding of a very small number of liquid
layers over them they obey the thrust that brings them to the
surface, and so render impossible the increase of kinetic energy

At the time we write a sufficient number of observations before
perihelion passage to allow of a reliable determination of the
orbit prior to the close approach to the sun, is not available.
By the way it strikes us it is about time that M. Crul's name
was disassociated fro a this comet; if personal names are to
be attached to naked-eye comets, a practice which to say the
least, is inconvenient, Mr. Finlay, so far as is known at present,
has the prior claim. The system generally adopted for some
years, of assigning letters, a, b, c, &c, to comets discovered in
a particular year, until their order of perihelion passage is defi-
nitely known, was, we think, an advantageous one, and its
discontinuance in some quarters is a retrograde step.

Comet 18S2 c (Barnard, September 10).From the first
observation at Harvard College on September 14, and observa-
tions by Prof. Millosevich, at the Collegio Romano in Rome, on
September 22 and October 7, Mr. Hind has calculated the
following elements of this comet:

From these elements it appears that the comet will be observ-
able in the southern hemisphere for some weeks after it descends
below the horizon in Europe. At perihelion passage on Novem-
ber 13, its ri^ht ascension will be about 199'4, with 664° south
declination, which places it near i) in the constellation Musca;
on December 10 it will be situate between the stars y and ri in
Ara, with 58° declination, and an intensity of light one-third
greater than at the first Harvard observation, and on January 9
its place will be near t Telescopii, with one-half the intensity
of light of September 14.

including a series by Blanpain at Marseilles, which they disco-

that, as far as our experiments gc-and we have now tried a
large number of dillerent leaves-although there are apparent
exceptions, this particular substance we call chlorophyll exists in
all green leaves. If thinner and thinner strata, or more and more dilute solu-
tions of the same thickness be examined, the fainter bands are
seen gradually to fade out, and what is of importance, the
dominant band, the last to disappear, thins out to a band from
670 to 660.
Passing over a large number of experiments on other points,
we shall limit our present communication as far as possible to an
account of the action of acids and alkalis on this so-called
chlorophyll.
It is a bodyexceedingly sensitive to the action of acids. If
for instance a mere trace of hydrochloric acid gas be introduced
into the air of a test-tube containing a chlorophyll-solution, on
shaking the tube, the 628 band will be found to have moved
slightly towards the blue, and the next band to have becotre
fainter. This action of the acid, specially with regard to the
628 band, is very remarkable; the addition of acid gradually
causes this band to move bodily towards the blue, till it reaches
611 S99 So constant and complete is this action, that the

or above, then on redissolution it will be found to have changed
and to give no longer the original, but the second spectrum. Let
the evaporation take place at ordinary temperatures in a current
of air, or under the air-pump, then, on at once redissolving the
residue, no change will have occurred; if, however, after the
evaporation, the dry mass be kept for Z1 short time, it .will
change even at ordinary temperatures. Further, if the alcoholic
solution he diluted with water, and then boiled, the body giving

spectrum N o. 2 is formed ; and the addition of certain salts, such
as mercuric chloride, ferric chloride, &c., causes a similar
change. Alum precipitates the colouring tnatter, and if the
precipitate be collectefl, washed, and dried at ordinary tempera-
tures, and again dissolved, it will give the second spectrum. On
the other hand, basic acetate of lead precipitates the chlorophyll
unchanged.
Acids, heat, metallic solutions, all action the chlorophyll, and
all give risc to an identical spectrum, and therefore, we con-
clude, to the same body. Further, it is of interest to note the
identity of these processes with those used to coagulate albumin,
and consequently the probability that the change in both cases is
of a similar character.
Since these changes are produced by processes and reagents
which differ so materially, \\e are bound to conclude that the
change is a molecular, not a chemical one. In these cases the
least refrangible hand does not alter, for if the solution he
diluted, it always thins do\vn to a hand from 670 to 660; the
other three bands, on the contrary, all change, the 628-607
moving towards the blue, the 589-573 band disappearing, and
the 544- 5 31 band becoming very much darker. In fact,

body, the chlorophyll, re nains quite unchanged by the benzene,
but thit certain bodies which absorb in the blue are insoluble in
this meistruam: hence the change in colour.
Hydrochloric acid has appa'ently considerable power of de-
stroyin; certtin of these blue-abs >rbing bodies, for on adding
this a:id to an ordinary chlorophyll solution, blue rays come
through, where before the addition it was quite dark. This fact
has also this applicition: by mean; of it chlorophyll can be
obtain ;d mire free from blue-absorbing matter than in any other
way we are acquainted with. If to a i alcoholic chlorophyll solu-
tion dilute hydrochloric acid be added, a precipitate is obtained,
and if this be washed, dried, and dissolved in ether or in a mix-
ture of alcohol and ether, it gives a solution which shows, not
only the binds of the o-modification, but also a band at the blue
end of the spectrum, which was before alluded to, quite dark
and distinct from 513 to 499. In all probability this band is
present in other cases, but is masked by general absorption.
The action of alkalis on chl iropbyll is quite as marked and as
characteristic as the action of acids. On adding either an alco-
holic or an a tueoui solution of potash or soda to a chlorophyll
solution, two eff.cts a-e produced: one is the fading out of all

except the least refrangible, the dominant band, and the other is
the spread of this ban! twards the blue, extending from 674
to 628. The action of alkali does not, however, stop here, for if
a c insiderable excess be present, another, and an exceedingly
interesting change sets in the dominant ban 1 nowfrjm 674 to
62S diviiin* into twodistinx bands,1 one from 674 to 660, and
the other from 646 to 632; then if sufficient alkali b: present,
the 674 to 628 band gradually becomes fainter and fainter,
and ultimately the one from 674 to 628 alone remains.
The same changes can be brought about with the o- and
fl-chloro phyll, but with far more difficulty. To change these
varieties the pota-h or soda must be stronger, and the con-
tact longer. With ammonia we believe we have broken this
band up, but in alino.t all cases ammonia is without action
on these inodifi:d chlorophylls, and it is quite clear that, as
regards the action of alkalis, the a- and ^-chlorophylls are far
more stable than normal chlorophyll. There are other and more
convenient methods fir preptring this one-banded modification
of chlorophyll. One is to evaporate an alcoholic solution of
chlorophyll to dryness over a water-bitli; then treat the residue
with water, which washes out a soluble yellow subs'ance, varying
very much in amount with different samples of chlorophyll; and
then evaporate the residue several times to dryness with a
mixture of equil pirts of ammonia and water. Another method
is to act on the chlorophyll with a solution of copper sulphate;
       Public Domain in the United States, Google-digitized / http://www.hathitrust.org/access_use#pd-us-google
the precipitate formed is washed with water until all the co; per
is removed, then dried, and dissolved in alcohol and ether.
It gives a spectrum identical with that obtained by the
ammonia process, and like it the band is capable of being
split up int> two bands. In the filtrate from the above
precipita'e there is always much chlorophyll remaining,
but this, curiously enough, has also been modified, and
now gives only the one-bind spectra n. When we first obtained
this one-banded substance, the position of this band appeared so
nearly to correspond with that of the dominant band in a strong
solution, that we were inclined to believe that we had really
separated the bodies giving the more refrangible bands, from
those which give the less refrangible; but evidently this is not
the case; neither does it now seem at all probable that such a
separation would be possible.
We have used the term one-banded modification of the
chlorophyll, and are aware of the possible ambiguity that this
band can be split into two; but this change is really brought
about only by the continued action of alkalis, for on simply
diluting the solution down even to the vanishing point of the
band, there is no indication of two bands being present.

.ing to ihe decomposition taking place in such a solution, still
the green colour from the modified chlorophyll will long remain,
single drop of hydrochloric acid added to the green extract,
although it at once changes the bright green to a darker and
owner jjreen, enables the solution to resist this action of light
a much greater extent than it could have done if no acid had
been added.
In the one-banded modification of chlorophyll we appear to
have a body on which light has no action; solutions of this
body have been, for the last three months, exposed continuously
all the light and sunshine we could get, and they are unchanged in colour and constitution; another proof of the really
Dndcrful stability of this substance. Again, as a confirmation
the properties and formation of this form of chlorophyll, a
single drop of sulphate of copper added to an ordinary
chlorophyll extract renders the green colour of the solution
permanent.
The very striking change of tint which occurs when a strong
chlorophyll solution is very considerably diluted, whereupon it
changes from a dark to a light yellowish green, forcibly suggests
us the probability that the difference in shade of old leaves as
compared with young ones, is due to the same cause, namely,

A* A METHOD OF INVESTIGATING EX-
PERIMENTALLY THE ABSORPTION OF
RADIANT HEAT BY GASES1
rilERE are grave objections, which have been only partially
overcome, to almost all the processes hitherto employed for
testing the diathermancy of vapours. These arise chiefly from
>ndensation on some part of the apparatus. Thus when rock-
salt is used, an absorbent surface-layer may be formed ; and,
when the pile is used without a plate of salt, the effect of radiant
heat may be to cool it (the pile) by the evaporation of such a
surface film. The use of intermittent radiation is liable to the
same objection.
Some time ago it occurred to me that this part of the difficulty
might be got rid of by dispensing with the pile, and measuring
the amount of absorption by its continued effects on the volume
and pressure of the gas or vapour itself.
Only preliminary trials have, as yet, been made. They were
carried out for me by Prof. Mac-Gregor and Mr. Lindsay.
Their object was first to find whether the method would work
well, second (when this was satisfactorily proved) to find the best
form and dimensions for the apparatus.
The rough apparatus is merely a double cylinder, placed ver-
cally. Cold water circulates in the jacket, and steam can be
blown into the double top. The changes in the pressure of the

gas are shown by a manometer (J tube at the bottom, which
ontains a liquid which will not absorb the contents. This
apparatus was 4 feet long, with 2 inches internal radius. The
results of a number of experiments show that i should be shorter
and much wider. The former idea I w as not quite prepared for,
the latter is obvious.
The effects on the manometer are due to five chief causes :
1. Heating of the upper layer of gas by contact with lid.
2. Cooling ,, ,, ,,  sides.
3. Heating of more or less of the column by absorption.

(1) and (2) only are present in a perfectly diathermancus gas,
and in a perfectly adiathermanous gas or vapour.
All five are present in a partially diathermanous gas or vapour.
The preliminary experiments show that the manometer effect
is only very slightly less for dry olefiant gas than for dry air,
while moist air shows a markedly smaller effect than either of
the others.
